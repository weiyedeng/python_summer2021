3-Aug-21,Remarks on Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic and an Exchange with Reporters,"THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Last week, I laid out what we need to do to beat the COVID-19 vi- -- pandemic and the challenges posed by the Delta variant.
This is a very different variant than what we've dealt with previously. It's highly transmissible, and it's causing a new wave of cases. It accounts for over 80 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the United States today. Experts tell us that we're going to see these cases rise in the weeks ahead -- a largely preventable tragedy that will get worse before it gets better.
What's different about this surge from previous ones is we have the tools to prevent this rise in cases from shutting down
our businesses, our schools, our society, as we saw what happened last year.
And while cases are on the rise, it's important to note we've not seen a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most areas of the country.
That's because 165 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of the most vulnerable Americans -- our seniors.
The best line of defense against the Delta vac- -- the virus is the vaccine. It's as simple as that. Period. The vaccine.
I want to be crystal clear about what's happening in the country today: We have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
Now, I know there's a lot of misinformation out there, so here are the facts: If you're vaccinated, you are highly unlikely to get COVID-19. And even if you do, the chances are you won't show any symptoms; and if you do, they'll most likely be very mild.
Vaccinated people almost never are hospitalized with COVID-19. In fact, according to one recent study, 95 percent of overall COVID-19 hospitalizations are among those not fully vaccinated.
And the data shows that virtually all the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19 are from the unvaccinated population.
Last month, a study showed that over 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths have among -- have been among the unvaccinated people. Ninety-nine percent.
That means, if you're unvaccinated, you are much more likely to, one, get COVID-19; two, get hospitalized; and, three, die if you get it.
This is a tragedy. People are dying and will die who don't have to die. The data is absolutely clear: As I've said, we have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
Think of it this way: A hundred and ninety-one million Americans have gotten at least one shot, including 70 percent of adults over the age of 18. A hundred and sixty-five million Americans are fully vaccinated, but about ninety million Americans are eligible for vaccines and still haven't gotten their first shot.
You know, I think there's a clear link between the lowest-vaccinated -- I know -- I don't think, actually -- the lowest-vaccinated states and the states with the highest case rates.
This past week, the most vaccinated state in America,
Vermont, has seen just five new cases -- five -- per day of COVID-19 for every 100,000 people who live in that state. That means, on any given day, only 30 people in the entire state of Vermont got COVID-19.
Nearby Maine, which has vaccinated almost 80 percent of their adults, has seen just six new cases per 100,000.
But the states with the lowest vaccination rates are seeing 10 to 20 times as many new cases per 100,000 people. It's moving like wildfire through the unvaccinated community. And it's heartbreaking, particularly because it's preventable.
That's why we're doing everything we can to get more people vaccinated. And we're seeing real results.
In the past two weeks, we have seen a 55 percent increase in the average number of new people getting vaccinated every day.
In the last seven days alone, nearly 3 million Americans have gotten their first shot. That's the highest seven-day total in a month.
Importantly, over the past two weeks, the eight states with the highest current case rates have seen a doubling of the number of people newly vaccinated each day. The message is getting through, apparently.
Louisiana has seen a 212 percent increase in the average number of newly vaccinated people in that state per day, going from 3,600 to over 11,000 people vaccinated per day.
Arkansas is up 99 percent. Mississippi is up 125 percent. Alabama is up 186 percent -- going from 3,200 to 9,150 people vaccinated per day. This will make a big difference.
These are encouraging signs. We have to continue our aggressive efforts to vaccinate the unvaccinated.
Last week, I announced additional steps to incentivize Americans to get vaccinated, including calling on states to offer $100 for anyone willing to step up and get a vaccination shot.
You know, and already Minnesota and New Mexico have done that. And North Carolina announced its 100-day incentive -- its $100 incentive today.
Places that have offered the hundred thou- -- the hundred thousand -- (laughs) -- the hundred dollars -- that'd be really good. I'd go back and get vaccinated three times. (Laughter.) But all kidding aside, offered the $100 to get vaccination have seen an uptick of 25 percent of daily vaccination rates.
We also announced that small- and medium-sized businesses will be fully reimbursed for offering paid time off for their employees to get vaccinated and for them to take a child or a parent to get vaccinated.
And I announced some tough, sometimes unpopular steps to keep people safe and our economy strong. All federal workers must report their vaccination status or be subject to strict requirements. Any federal worker who does not attest to their vaccination status or is not vaccinated will be required to mask no matter where they work, test one to twice a week, socially distance, and generally will not be allowed to travel for work.
I directed my administration to take steps to apply similar standards to all federal contractors. If you want to do business with the federal government, get your workers vaccinated.
And I also directed the Pentagon to look at adding COVID-19 to the list of vaccinations that are required for our troops because others are required.
I approved the Department of Veterans Affairs to require doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers who care for our veterans to be vaccinated.
And the good news is that now many are following the federal government's lead. In the past several days, states and local officials have come out to impose similar vaccination mandates.
And the private sector is stepping up as well. Even Fox has vaccination requirements. I want to thank Walmart, Google, Netflix, Disney, Tyson Foods for their recent actions requiring vaccination for employees.
Look, I know this isn't easy, but I will have their backs and the backs of other private and public sector leaders if they take such steps.
But others have declined to step up. I find it disappointing. And worst of all, some state officials are passing laws or signing orders that forbid people from doing the right thing.
As of now, seven states not only ban mask mandates, but also ban them in their school districts, even for young children who cannot get vaccinated. Some states have even banned businesses and universities from requiring workers and students to be masked or vaccinated.
And the most extreme of those measures is like the one in Texas that say state universities or community colleges could be fined if it allows a teacher to ask her unvaccinated students to wear a mask.
What are we doing?
COVID-19 is a national challenge, and we must come together -- we have to come together -- all of us together, as a country, to solve it.
Make no mistake: The les- -- the exc- -- ex- -- excuse me -- the escalation of cases is particularly concentrated in states with low vaccination rates. Just two states, Florida and Texas, account for one third of all new COVID-19 cases in the entire country. Just two states.
Look, we need leadership from everyone. And if some governors aren't willing to do the right thing to beat this pandemic, then they should allow businesses and universities who want to do the right thing to be able to do it.
I say to these governors, ""Please, help."" But if you aren't going to help, at least get out of the way of the people who are trying to do the right thing. Use your power to save lives.
I've made it our first and top priority to have a vaccine available for every single American from the day I got elected. That was my priority. And let me be clear: We have a supply for every single American, and that will never change.
At the same time, it's also in our national interest to share some of our vaccines with the world, which gets me to the second thing I want to discuss today.
From the beginning of my presidency, I've been very clear-eyed that we need to attack this virus globally, not just at home, because it's in America's self-interest to do so.
The virus knows no boundaries. You can't build a wall high enough to keep it out. There is no wall high enough or ocean wide enough to keep us safe from a vaccination in other -- from the COVID-19 in other countries.
In fact, just like the original virus that caused COVID-19, the Delta variant came from abroad. As long as the virus continue to rage outs- -- rage outside the United States, potentially more dangerous variants could arrive at our shores again.
And we know that COVID-19 in other countries stifles economic growth, disrupts supply chains, risks instability and weakness of governments. And as we've seen in the United States, the key to growing economies is to vaccinate people.
So just as the American economy is recovering, it's in all of our interests to have global -- the global economy begin to recover as well.
This is about our values. We value inherent dignity of all people -- the inherent dignity of everyone. In times of trouble, Americans reach out to offer a helping hand. That's who we are.
And I've said before: In this fight against COVID-19, the United States is committed to be the arsenal of vaccines, just as we were the arsenal of democracy during World War Two.
And we're backing up that commitment. We have contributed more than any other nation to COVAX -- the collective global efforts delivering COVID-19 vaccines across the world.
We have supported manufacturing efforts abroad through our partnerships with Japan, India, Australia –- known as ""the Quad.""
During my trip to Europe in June, I announced that the United States would purchase a groundbreaking 500 million doses of Pfizer and then donate them -- those doses -- nearly -- to nearly a hundred low- and middle-income countries who don't have the vaccine. Those doses will start to ship at the end of this month.
We also announced that we'd donate 80 million doses of our own vaccine to supply the world, which has already begun.
And today, I have an important update. We've already exceeded 80 million doses that have been -- gone out. As of today, the United States has shipped over 110 million doses of U.S. vaccines to 65 countries that are among the hardest hit in the world.
Let me say it again: As of today, we have shipped over 110 million doses to 65 nations.
According to the United Nations, this is more than the donations of all 24 countries that have donated any vaccine to other countries, including China and Russia -- all those nations combined.
These vaccine donations from America are free. We're not selling them. There are no demands, no conditions, no coercion attached. And there is no favoritism and no strings attached. We're doing this to save lives and to end this pandemic. That's it.
In fact, we're donating vaccines to countries that have real issues -- we have real issues with.
And we'll continue to give tens of millions of the doses away across the summer and work to increase U.S. manufacturing and manufacturing of vaccines around the world as well.
And it's not just vaccines. We are continuing to provide
countries with -- in need -- with more testing, protective equipment, and personnel to stem the surge of the virus. We've done it in India and elsewhere.
Let me close with this. I've said before: In the race for the 21st century between democracies and autocracies, we need to prove that democracies can deliver.
And the democracies of the world are looking to America to lead again -- in two ways. First, to demonstrate we can control this virus at home. And second, to show we can help address it around the world.
Vaccinate America and help vaccinate the world -- that's how we're about to beat this thing.
We're always going to have enough doses for every American who wants one. Our work in donating vaccines to the world is about America following through on our promises and delivering what we say we'll deliver.
It's showing how American science and technology, American businesses and academia, and our government can all work together.
Above all, it's proving democracies can deliver and, yet again, that America is back leading the world -- not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.
We still have a lot of work to do. So if you're unvaccinated, please, please, please get the shot.
But just don't take it from me. Just read the news. Listen to the voices of the unvaccinated patients in the hospital. They are spending [sending] the most powerful message to their families and everyone around the world -- a powerful message to everybody. As they're lying in bed, many dying from COVID-19, they're asking, ""Doc, can I get the vaccine?"" The doctors have to look them in the eye and say, ""No, sorry. It's too late.""
Right now, too many people are dying or watching a loved one dying and saying, ""If I just got vaccinated. If I just…""
Folks, this is isn't about politics. The virus doesn't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican. This is about life and death. Life and death.
I can't say it any more plainly than this: The vaccine saves lives, and it could save yours or your child's.
You know, I know we can do this. We're the United States of America. We're prepared like never before. We have the tools and the resources to save lives at home and around the world.
This is who we are. This is what we do. This is why there's no nation like us on Earth.
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.
And I'll take a few questions.
Q: Mr. President, I have a question for you on coronavirus, but first I'd like to start with the news of the day -- given, back in March, you said that if the investigation confirmed the allegations against Governor Cuomo, then he should resign. So, will you now call on him to resign, given the investigators said the 11 women were credible?
THE PRESIDENT: I stand by that statement.
Q: Are you now calling on him to resign?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
Q: And if he doesn't resign, do you believe he should be impeached and removed from office?
THE PRESIDENT: Let's take one thing at a time here. I think he should resign.
Q: Do you think --
THE PRESIDENT: I understand that the state legislature may decide to impeach. I don't know that for a fact; I've not read all that data.
Q: And he's using a photo of you embracing him in his self-defense to say that these are commonplace kind of embraces that he made in the allegations against him. Do you condone that?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, I'm not going to flyspeck this. I'm sure there are some embraces that were totally innocent, but app- -- apparently, the Attorney General decided there were things that weren't.
Q: And on coronavirus, if I could ask you a question about the evictions.
THE PRESIDENT: Why don't you come up and take the platform? (Laughter.)
Q: No, thank you.
On the evictions and the moratorium that lapsed on Saturday night: What is your strategy to prevent potentially millions of people from being evicted from their homes, given what we are told your administration is considering -- a targeted moratorium -- is likely to face legal challenges?
THE PRESIDENT: Any call for a moratorium based on the Supreme Court recent decision is likely to face obstacles. I've indicated to the CDC I'd like them to look at other alternatives than the one that is in pow- -- in existence, which the Court has declared they're not going to allow to continue. And the CDC will have something to announce to you in the next hour to two hours.
Q: Thank you.
Q: President Biden, on overseas coronavirus vaccines: Should other high-income countries follow the lead of the United States and increase donations to low- and middle-income countries?
THE PRESIDENT: I think those countries that have been able to cover their population and have the ability to provide either dollars and/or vaccine for the 100 or so na- -- poor nations that need help should do so. We had that discussion at the G7. A number of those countries said they were going to do that. Some have followed through.
The point I was making is, though, I've kept the commitment -- we've kept the commitment that we would do what we said, which is more than all the rest of the countries combined thus far.
Q: Mr. President, do you believe that Governor DeSantis and Governor Abbott are personally making decisions that are harming their own citizens?
THE PRESIDENT: I believe the results of their decisions are not good for their constituents. And it's clear to me and to most of the medical experts that the decisions being made, like not allowing mask mandates in school and the like, are bad health policy -- bad health policy.
Q: Mr. President, I have a question about something that you just said.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm sure you do.
Q: Thank you. You just said there is no wall high enough and no ocean wide enough to protect us from the virus. So what is the thinking behind letting untested and unvaccinated migrants cross the southern border into U.S. cities in record numbers?
THE PRESIDENT: There is -- what we're doing -- we have not withdrawn the order that is sometimes critical -- criticized -- saying that unvaccinated people should be -- go back across the border.
But unaccompanied children is a different story, because there's -- that's the most humane thing to do is to test them and to treat them and not send them back alone.
Q: Mr. President, have you spoken with Governor Cuomo today?
THE PRESIDENT: I have not.
Q: And then one other question on the virus. You just said we have -- we have to continue our aggressive efforts to get the unvaccinated vaccinated. Other countries have found a lot of success in requiring vaccines in public places. New York City just announced today that they'll require vaccines for restaurants and gyms. Do you think more cities and states should institute rules like that?
THE PRESIDENT: I do.
Q: And are you going to publicly call on them? Should they institute a vaccine passport-type system, or it's up to each city and state to figure that out on their own?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm sorry. What did you say?
Q: Do you think that they should institute a vaccine passport-type system or some sort of verification to use public spaces?
THE PRESIDENT: I don't think they need to do that. I think they just need to give the authority of those restaurants or businesses to say, ""In order to come in, you have to give proof that you've been vaccinated or you can't come in.""
I'll take a couple more.
Q: Mr. President can I ask you about news of the day -- one more on Governor Cuomo? You're calling for him to resign now. My question is: Do you think he should be prosecuted? And what is your message to the women who have now accused him of sexually harassing them and abusing them?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, what I said was: If the investigation of the Attorney General concluded that the allegations were correct, that -- back in March -- that I would recommend he resign. That's what I'm doing today. I've not read the report. I don't know the detail of it. All I know is the end result.
Q: Mr. President, a question on COVID, if I could, really quickly. It's the eviction moratorium. Can you explain a little bit more why it took so long to have a possible eviction moratorium be put into place? There was -- there are people -- this expired on Saturday. I'm wondering -- there are folks who are saying it took too long for this to happen.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the courts made it clear that the existing moratorium was not constitutional; it wouldn't stand. And they made that clear back in, I guess, July 15th or July 18th.
In the meantime, what I've been pushing for and calling for is we have billions of dollars that were given to states to provide for rent and utilities for those people who can't afford to stay in their homes because they can't -- an apartment -- they can't pay their rent. And so, we're urging them to distribute those funds to the landlords. I believe that would take care of the vast majority of what needs to be done to keep people in their -- in their ho- -- in their apartments now.
And so that's what we're working on. Some states have done it and some communities have, but they have not. The money is there. It's not -- we don't have to send it out. It's been sent out to the states and counties -- billions of dollars -- for the express purpose of providing for back rent and rent for the people who are in the middle of this crisis. And that's there; that's what we're pushing now. And we've been pushing that. That's the immediate thing to do.
I'll take one more question.
Q: Mr. President, thank you so much. There was an expectation that you would be announcing new vaccines to the world today -- a new -- other than the ones you promised. Are you ready to send more vaccines to the world?
And there is a delegation from the White House going to Brazil tomorrow. Are they bringing more vaccines? Are they announcing more vaccines to Brazil?
THE PRESIDENT: No -- are they announcing more vaccines overall?
Q: Overall. And then to Brazil -- for the delegation coming to Brazil tomorrow -- will you be bringing vaccines?
THE PRESIDENT: The answer is: I don't know whether the delegation going physically has vaccines with them. We have provided vaccines to --
Q: Are they bringing the announcement? Are they announcing there?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, there's a need for several billion doses around the world. We have committed to over a half a billion doses. And we're trying to provide for more and provide for the capacity of countries like India to be able to produce the vaccine themselves. And we're helping them do that. That's what we're doing now.
And we're trying to -- we're -- and, by the way, it's free. We're not charging anybody anything. And we're trying to do as much as we possibly can.
Thank you all very much.
Q: Mr. President, we're learning that your administration is about to announce a new partial eviction moratorium, COVID related. Can you tell us any more about that? And are you sure it's going to pass Supreme Court muster?
THE PRESIDENT: The answer is twofold. One, I've sought out constitutional scholars to determine what is the best possibility that would come from executive action, or the CDC's judgment, what could they do that was most likely to pass muster, constitutionally.
The bulk of the constitutional scholarship says that it's not likely to pass constitutional muster. Number one. But there are several key scholars who think that it may and it's worth the effort. But the present -- you could not -- the Court has already ruled on the present eviction moratorium.
So I think what you're going to see, and I -- look, I want to make it clear: I told you I would not tell the Justice Department or the medical experts, the scientists what they should say or do. So I don't want to get ahead.
The CDC has to make the -- I asked the CDC to go back and consider other options that may be available to them. You're going to hear from them what those other options are.
I have been informed they're about to make a judgment as to potential other options. Whether that option will pass constitutional measure with this administration, I can't tell you. I don't know. There are a few scholars who say it will and others who say it's not likely to.
But, at a minimum, by the time it gets litigated, it will probably give some additional time while we're getting that $45 billion out to people who are, in fact, behind in the rent and don't have the money. That's why it was passed in -- in the act that we passed in the beginning of my administration, and it went to the states.
We were under the impression that the states were moving this money out relatively rapidly. So, for example, if I'm in an apartment -- if you're in an apartment, and you're behind on four- or five-month's rent, and let's say your rent is $2,000 a month -- I'm just making this up out of the blue -- and you're behind, you need $10,000 to catch up. Hardly anybody has that $10,000. But there is money that the states have that can give to the landlord that $10,000 to the back rent.
The future rent, it's unlikely -- at least the hope is, since they have been made whole to that point -- that they'd be inclined -- because the economy is growing -- inclined not to throw someone out in the street; keep that person -- no guarantee -- keep that person in the apartment, keep these kids in the same school district, and count on being able to have the opportunity for that -- that person to be able -- who may now be employed -- to pay their rent.
But in the meantime, I've asked, isn't there any safety valve we can put in? And it's the one I explained to you. Again, CDC will announce that and the details of exactly how it works. I'm not telling -- I told them I want them to take a look. I didn't tell them what they had to do.
And my hope is, it's going to be a new moratorium that in some way -- and I'm not going to announce it now; I'll let them announce it -- in some way covers close to 90 percent of the American people who are renters. And so that's all I can tell you now.
Thank you very much.
Q: Why not 100 percent? What's the difference?
THE PRESIDENT: Because it's a -- (laughs) -- let them explain that to you. Okay? I don't want to get too far ahead.
Thank you.
Q: Mr. President, is COVAX doing enough to get shots in arms?
Q: Why not call Governor DeSantis, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) To say ""happy birthday""? What? I mean --
Q: To deliver the message that you seem to be delivering today about ""get out of the way.""
THE PRESIDENT: He knows the message. He knows the message. We had a little discussion when I was down there. He knows the message.
Q: What did he say to you in that discussion?
THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) See you all later.",NA,"Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic and an Exchange with Reporters Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/351907 ",,,,,,,,,,,
3-Aug-21,Remarks in a Meeting with Latino Community Leaders and an Exchange with Reporters,"THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, everybody, welcome. Today, I have the privilege of meeting with Latino leaders to discuss a bunch of key issues that affect the community; the progress we're making against the pandemic; historic and economic recovery we're under- -- that's undergoing -- we're undergoing; and immigration and voting rights, which are critical.
Latino leaders have been essential to helping us get the country vaccinated, with 70 percent of all adult Americans receiving at least one shot.
The vaccines work. Even as cases go up due to the highly transmissionable [sic] -- transmissible disease, the Delta variant, we're not seeing a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most of the country because of the vaccinations. This is an epidemic of the unvaccinated -- a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
But we need everyone to get vaccinated in this pandemic. And it's critical to keeping the economy strong.
And in six months, we're seeing the fastest job growth of any point in any administration in history from the beginning of their administration, and the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years.
And we have an opportunity to make historic investments in infrastructure and in American families, and finally build an economy that deals everybody in.
I've been saying from the beginning when I announced that I'm tired of trickle down. It doesn't work very well. But when you build from the bottom up and the middle out, everybody does well, including the wealthy. That's what this is all about.
And so, creating millions of good-paying jobs in every community and -- including Latino neighborhoods -- delivering affordable child and -- care and paid leave and universal pre-K, two years of community college.
You know, today marks, as we all know -- no one knows this better than this community – a two-year -- two years of -- since the shooting in El Paso. And all of us have, in our personal lives, lost people unexpectedly. Most of us have. We know how devastating it is, particularly one that was born out of such hatred.
But you know, I did a piece -- Jill and I did a piece for the El Paso Times, but I realized after it was published that I didn't talk about an aspect that is really important: There were 236 people who were wounded. How are they doing? The trauma. The equivalent of post-traumatic stress that comes from these kinds of things. I -- and the need for -- and I hope we'll -- we can talk about it a little bit later as well -- is the need for mental health services and a whole range of things that affect not only them but their families when they've survived.
But to the families who have lost loved ones, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Jill and send our love -- as all of you do, I know.
But I know, you know, these anniversaries are -- should be celebrated in a sense of recognize -- so we see things don't happen again. But, you know, they're terrible for the victims and the survivors because it brings back everything like it happened the very moment ago. And I -- it takes enormous courage for people to -- to respond that way.
You know, and I know how hard these anniversaries are. As I said, no matter how much time has passed, it brings it all back like it happened that second.
The El Paso community -- you know, they continue to show their courage and the resilience. But to all Americans, this tragedy reminds us of the unfinished work to heal -- and I know I got criticized for running on it, but I really mean it -- heal the soul of this country. We have to return to some decency and honor, and I just -- anyway.
The gunman targeted people and the diversity of El Paso and our most deeply held American values. And, you know, we all act together to counter what is basically domestic terrorism, domestic violence, domestic extremism, and end the scourge of gun violence in America. We can't end it, but we sure can make a big difference than what it is now. And so, I continue to do everything in my power to do that.
The most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland in recent years is domestic terrorism -- domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy. We're going to have to stand united against this violence because it just spills over to all communities.
And my administration is carrying out the country's first-ever comprehensive effort to tackle the threat of domestic terrorism -- from reducing online radicalization to disrupting networks that inspire violence, and providing resources to communities to build up some resilience.
And I'm going to continue to fight this for more commonsense gun laws. And we're going to continue to call on Congress to take action, which they've been reluctant to do.
That includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like the one used in El Paso. The idea anybody needs, for a pistol and/or a rifle -- anyone needs 10, 12, 20, 30, 100 rounds in a rifle is just -- it just makes no sense at all. Zero. Doesn't violate anybody's Second Amendment rights to say, ""You can't do that."" But it just has to stop.
And that includes using my existing authority, which I have, to -- from reining in ""ghost guns"" and -- to investing in community policing and community violence intervention, to having -- bringing in psychologists and social workers into the police forces to help.
And, you know, I look forward to hearing from this group about all of these issues and a lot more. And -- but, with that, we're going to discuss a wide range of issues, all of us here tonight -- today. And I'm looking forward to it.
So, thank you all. Thank you, press, for being here.

THE PRESIDENT: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Q: Should Andrew Cuomo resign, sir?

2-Aug-21,Remarks at a Virtual Fundraising Reception for the Democratic National Committee,"Via Teleconference
7:19 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Tom. Thanks for that introduction and for your generous support. And I want to thank you all. And, Jamie, for your support as well and being willing to take on the chairmanship.
You know, I didn't have it like you did, but I remember when my dad -- when things died up in Scranton; the coal dried up. He wasn't a coalminer; my great grandfather was. But he wasn't a coalminer, but everything else dried up. And he said -- I remember him going home to my grandpop, who had four sons and a daughter, and asking him is it okay if his wife -- my mother, Jean -- and the three kids move in with him for a year or so until they got straightened away down in northern Delaware -- a little town called Claymont.
And so that -- and he said -- I'll never forget it. He said, ""I'll come home every weekend, Joey. Every weekend. There's only 147 -- 157 miles."" And I thought, ""My God, that's a million miles."" I was going -- I was in third grade, going into fourth. And you know, it's a --
They used to have an expression -- and that's never -- and this is the God's truth. We got down to Delaware, as he worked his way through, after five years, being able to buy a small three-bedroom home. He used to say, ""Joey, a job is a lot more than a paycheck. It's about -- it's about your pride. It's about your place in the community. It's about your ability to look your kids in the eye. It's about your dignity."" And so it's much -- so much more.
And so, you know, when I ran with your help -- and I couldn't have made it -- with all the help of people on this line -- you know -- you know, we are part of something special because you allowed me to compete.
We -- I think we put together one of the most consequential campaigns in modern history. Because it really was, in my view, a battle for the soul of the nation: basic decency, building the middle class form the bottom up and the middle out, rather than waiting for everything to trickle down.
And a lot of you are very successful people on the line, but you shared that view and you gave me the money and contributions to be able to complete -- you know, I say -- I should say ""compete.""
And so, we're bound together in one of the most consequential first six months in the history of this country not because of me -- it's about the country; it's about people stepping up.
Think about the last six months. The American Rescue Plan.
We delivered shots in arms of millions and millions of people. Checks in pockets to hundreds of millions of Americans. And maybe the thing that I'm proudest of: We got the biggest middle-class tax cut of all time with the help of the -- cutting the child poverty in half through the childcare -- the Child Tax Credit.
And 165 million Americans are fully vaccinated. You got over 190 that have at least one shot -- one shot.
It's the fastest job growth in the first four months of any previous presidency. Period.
And a projected economic growth at nearly 7 percent -- the highest in four decades.
And last week, they -- the infrastructure plan that I introduced when I was running and put together with a bipartisan group -- I had to make some compromises, but it's going to make a gigantic difference.
For example, it's going to transform the economy. It's over -- over a trillion dollars. It's going to eliminate all lead pipes in America so people have decent drinking water. Build roads up to -- up to snuff so we build them back to, you know, making sure that they are where the environment is now -- not -- we have to build them back better. Childcare. The caring economy. The eldercare. The things that the American public wants most.
Man, look -- and delivering high-speed Internet to every American. Delivering clean water, as I said, to every American.
Building more resilient power grids. Installing electric vehicle charging stations-- over 500,000. The largest investment in public transit in rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago.
But it's all about, as my dad's notion, it's about creating good-paying American jobs for millions of middle-class people and the working-class people. And it's about our economic competitiveness.
You know, as a -- as the Democratic Party, I think we're going to be able to say, going into these off-year elections, as the chairman said, that we can deliver. We can deliver for the American people. We can bring the country together. We can make a difference in their lives.
And, you know, it's about including everyone this time around -- Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American communities -- because I said the administration and our efforts would reflect what the country looked like.
And as I said, we're in the race for the 21st century economy and the rest of the world is not hanging around and waiting. We have to move fast.
And the bottom line, for me, is this: that we're signaling -- we're signaling to the rest of the world and to ourselves that we can function, we can deliver, we can do significant things. And we've got a lot more to do as we invest in physical infrastructure, also invest in human infrastructure, childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K through two years of -- and two years of community college.
When I hear about, ""Well, you know, that's not -- that's not investing"" -- well, let me tell you, when I was Vice President, I was asked to do a survey along the Secretary of Commerce of the 500 CEOs of the five -- Fortune 500 to see what their greatest needs are. We got the 340-some. You know what they said, almost to a person? They said, ""We need a better-educated public."" Well, they're not educating the public. And so, what are we going to do?
If I said to you tomorrow, ""We can maintain exorbitant tax cuts for the super wealthy"" -- and many of you are -- ""or we can make sure that every kid, starting at age three, four, and five, is in preschool, not daycare, and they have access to community college so we're the best-educated public in the world,"" which do you think is going to best promote the country's growth? You know what it is.
So, look, let me close. I'm -- I'm taking too much time. I want to meet each one of you. But, look, we need -- the single-most important thing that we have to do is we have to protect the voting system, protect the sacred right to vote. It's under assault in ways I haven't seen in my entire career. And I was the guy who was able to get the Voting Rights exten- -- Act extended 25 years before, when I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. And it wasn't until the Supreme Court came along and said, ""No, no, don't need it anymore.""
It's about who gets to vote and whether the vote counts, and who gets to count that vote. We have a system that does both those things with independence and integrity. But what Republicans want to do is say a political party gets to decide if a vote counts. It's outrageous. We're going to fight like hell so that doesn't happen. That's one of the most important things we can do.
There's a lot of work ahead. It's not going to be easy. But I'm going to need you to do it. The DNC is going to need you. And because -- here's the deal: We won in 2020 as a unified party. As we look to 2022, we need to stay unified. The question the American people are going to be asking is whether we're helping them and their families, and do we understand what they're going through; do we understand their problem; can we deliver for them.
You know, as Democrats, we have to show that we understand, number one; we're delivering, number two; and we're keeping our promise. We just have to keep making our case -- just as the Republican party today offers nothing but fear, lies, and broken promises. We have to keep cutting through the Republican fog --that the government isn't the problem, and show that we, the people -- we, the people, are always the solution.
We're the most unique country in the history of the world. You've heard me say this before. We're the only country that's organized based on an ide- -- on an idea, not religion, ethnicity, geography -- on an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are critical equal, endowed -- you know the rest.
But you have to be able to vote. It's the single-most important thing we could do. And we're going to have to win races up and down the ticket.
You know, in 2018, I was out of office, but I campaigned in 58 districts -- congressional districts they said we couldn't win. We won back the United States Congress.
And, look, if we make the right decision in the next few years, in 50 years people are going to look back and say, ""This was the moment that America won the 21st century."" I really believe that. But we can't do it without you. You know, we have to prove that democracies can work.
I'll conclude by saying -- and the press on the line has heard me say this before -- that Xi Jinping, and -- who I met hours and hours with -- over 25 hours -- 24 hours alone. When I won, he called me to congratulate me. We spent two hours and, I think, almost 25 minutes on the phone.
He believes, along with other autocrats, that in the modern world, things are changing so rapidly, so quickly that democracies can't get their acts together and unite to compete with -- with autocratic governments. He truly believes that. And he's decided that they're going to be the most powerful military force in the world, and the largest economy and the most organized economy in the world by 2045.
We've got to demonstrate that democracies can work and protect. And I think it's going to impact on our influence around the world more than anything.
That's why we have to do some of this stuff together with others to get it done -- get it done. And I'm convinced there's not much we can't do. I think the country is ready. And because of you, I think we're going to be able to get it done.
But I want to thank you all. Thank you for everything you've done. And, you know, we got to prove we can make democracy work again. That's what it's about.
So, God bless you all for what you've done and going -- going to do. And may God protect our troops.

30-Jul-21,Remarks in a Meeting with Cuban American Leaders and an Exchange with Reporters,"THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm honored to welcome members of the Cuban American community, and Senator Menendez, Senator [Congressman] Meeks to discuss how the United States is going to continue to stand with the Cuban people, who have suffered for decades and decades under a failed communist regime.
Earlier this month, Cubans took to the street in a historic demonstration of the will of the people of Cuba. The regime responded with violence and repression, mass detentions, sham trials, and people disappearing who -- who have spoken out. Just disappearing. Family members, I'm told, are not able -- have no idea where their family members are back in Cuba. And -- in a brazen violation of the rights of the Cuban people.
The Cuban Americans are hurting. They're hurting because their loved ones are suffering. And it's, quite frankly, intolerable.
So, I want the Cuban Americans to know that we -- all around this table and myself included -- see your pain, we hear your voices, and we hear the cries of freedom coming from the island.
The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people. We've brought to bear the strength of our diplomacy, rallying nations to speak out and increase pressure on the regime. And we're holding the regime accountable.
Last week, we sanctioned the head of Cuban armed forces and the government -- a government entity called the ""Black Berets"" for their involvement in suppressing protesters.
And, today, we are adding sanctions against the Revolutionary National Police, as well as individual sanctions against the chief and deputy chief -- the chief and deputy chief.
And we're going to continue to add sanctions on individuals that carry out -- that carry out the regime's abuses.
At the same time, we're increasing direct support for the Cuban people by pursuing every option available to provide Internet access to help the Cuban bypass -- the Cuban people bypass the censorship that's being mandatorily imposed.
You always know something is not going well when the -- a country will not allow -- will not allow their people to be engaged in -- be on the Internet and being able to make their case known around the world.
And we're expanding our assistance to political prisoners and dissidents.
And the direct State -- and I've directed the State Department and the Treasury Department to provide me, within one month, recommendations of how to maximize the flow of remittances to the Cuban people, without the Cuban military taking their cut.
And we're working to increase U.S. staffing at our embassy while prioritizing the safety of our personnel.
So, we've got a lot to discuss with this group. So, we got -- and mostly, I'm here to listen. I want to know what their ideas are. And you are some of the best experts on the issue.
The first person to bring this to my attention and to make sure that we were on top of this was Senator Menendez. And we think that -- you know, the American -- the Cuban American people are actually the best ambassadors for the Cuban people.
And so, my administration is going to make sure that their voices are included and uplifted at every step of the way. And we're gong to get down to business.
So, thank you all for bothering to come in. I appreciate it.
Q: Will there be more sanctions coming up, Mr. President? Or is that it, today?
THE PRESIDENT: I beg your pardon?
Q: I said: Will there be more sanctions against Cuba coming up or are you stopping with what you did today?
THE PRESIDENT: We are -- there will be more, unless there's some drastic change in Cuba, which I don't anticipate.

30-Jul-21,Remarks with the Vice President in a Virtual Meeting with Governors on Wildfires,"THE PRESIDENT: Jay, you're beginning to convince the American people there is a thing called ""climate crisis."" About time. (Laughs.)
GOVERNOR INSLEE: Indeed.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you all for being here. I'm going to make a brief statement here and then we'll get to ask the Vice President to say a few words, get to some questions, and we'll get down to business, if that's okay with you all.
You know, one month ago, we convened the first of what will be a regular presidential briefing on wildfire preparedness. And we're joined by many of the governors who -- we were joined by many of the governors who are with us today, as well as experts from across the administration and leaders from the electric utility sector.
I said then that the threat of Western wildfires this year was as severe as it's ever been. And in the past month, we've sadly seen the truth of that being played out.
Since our -- our last meeting, the number of large, uncontained wildfires has nearly doubled to 66 -- 66 of those fires. And the number of firefighters on the job to battle them has tripled. Over 3.4 million acres have already burned.
In Oregon, the Bootleg Fire has destroyed more than 400 structures, including more than 160 homes. In California, the Dixie Fire has grown to over 220,000 acres and our firefighters are working in really rugged and dangerous conditions and terrain.
The number of states are experiencing the impacts of smoke from these fires, degrading their air quality, not just where the fires are burning, but all the states moving east -- not all, but most.
In short, we've got big, complex wildfires burning across multiple areas. And despite the incredible -- and I'm not -- this is not being solicitous -- the incredible bravery and heroism of our firefighters, our resources are already being stretched to keep up. We need more help, particularly when we also factor in the additional nationwide challenges of pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and our ongoing efforts to fight COVID.
We've had a few COVID clusters at our fire camps, which further limits resources. It's just one more reason why it's so darn important that everyone get vaccinated, I might add.
Sadly, we've also lost two brave firefighters in the last month in a plane crash in Arizona, and five were seriously injured last week battling the Devil's Creek fire in Montana.
It's -- to state the obvious, and you governors know it better than anybody -- it is really, really dangerous work, and it takes incredible bravery to do it. And these heroes deserve to be paid -- and paid well -- for their work. That's why, last month, I was able to announce -- and it's not paying that well, in my view, to be honest with you -- immediate action to make all federal firefighters making at least $15 an hour. I think they deserve more than that.
We're also working with Congress to make sure that our firefighters are paid better permanently. Permanently. So far, FEMA has approved 20 Fire Management Assistance Grants totaling up to $100 million to help states pay for the cost of fighting these fires.
We're also working with FEMA and the Defense Logistical Agency to get ahead of this emergency supply chain challenges. And we still have some supply chain challenges relating to hoses and a number of other things.
We're trapped -- we've tapped additional aircraft from the Department of Defense to aid in the fire detection and firefighting. We also welcome the support of our allies, from Australia, for example, sending a large air tanker to which it's going to begin flying missions this week.
And last month, I also noted that the EPA would be launching an upgrade app for mobile phones to easily share location-specific information with the public about the effects of fire and smoke on air quality for them. It's now even more important, because smoke from many of these fires burning in the West and along the Canadian border is affecting air quality in states across the country.
As of today, the upgrade app -- the upgrade AirNow app is live and ready for use. Folks in affected areas should download this important tool as quickly as possible.
I also encourage our states and county leaders to continue partnering with FEMA, as many of the leaders on the scene today are leveraging our Public Alert and Warning systems to communicate information directly and quickly about -- to the public about wildfires, evacuations, power outages, and more.
I know several of the governors' states have used this system recently and send -- to send warnings of evacuation orders, and it has undoubtedly helped people and, we don't know for certain, but likely saved some lives.
But we're in for a long fight yet this year, and the only way we're going to meet those challenges is by working together.
Wildfires are a problem for all of us and we have to stay closely coordinated in doing everything we can for our people. That's why I asked the governors to join us -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- so they can update me and the Vice President directly on what they need and what we can possibly do more of. And so we can discuss what's needed today -- we have to meet an urgent danger at hand -- a plan for what we can do to make sure we're better prepared next time.
One of the important aspects of the -- of the bipartisan infrastructure deal that is before the Senate now is it includes billions of dollars -- billions of dollars -- to strengthen wildfire preparedness, resilience, and response.
It includes funding for prevention efforts, like forest management, and to restore millions of acres of high-risk areas to protect homes and public water sources for drinking. And -- you know, and overlaying all of this is the necessity to successfully confront climate change.
We may -- we have some significant changes we're making in these two pieces of legislation that, God willing, will pass in the next month or so.
But we can't ignore how the overlapping and intertwined factors of extreme heat, prolonged drought, and supercharged wildfire conditions are affecting the country.
And so, this is a challenge that demands our urgent, urgent action, both today and, as you all know better than anyone else in the country, not just today, but tomorrow, next year, and the year after.
And so, I want to thank you, Governors, for your leadership during what is an incredibly challenging period for all of you. God, love you. You're going through -- anyway. It's --
And I'd like to ask, now, the Vice President to make a few comments. And then, I have some questions for all and we get in a discussion, with your permission. Thank you.
Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. President.
We stand with you. We stand with you, and this is a commitment from our administration that we will not only stand with you, but stay in touch with you, mostly to hear from you. We know that the way that we can help you manage and expand your capacity is through the partnership that we have -- the federal and state government, along with local governments.
This -- this issue is ongoing. Each year, as we have discussed, it gets worse. It affects real people -- everything from children who are breathing the smoke to parents who are up at night, concerned that they may get an evacuation order at any -- at any moment. So, know that we are here to maximize the federal capacity to support the states.
I'm in D.C., but, of course, I'm a California girl and I care deeply about this. We -- as I think I've shared with many of you, our family has been under evacuation orders in the last couple of years. And -- and our folks should not have to fear that they are -- they are going to lose their home, everything they have, much less risk their lives in these moments.
So, thank you all for your courage, for your leadership, and I look forward to staying in touch with you.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
Folks, I asked the staff -- because I think it's -- I've had the great honor of being, over the last 15 years, in your states and in the wilderness areas and the national parks. And I asked my staff to put together maps where exactly where the fires are and the areas they're in and what they're affecting.
And so, I want to start off with you, Governor Gianforte, up in Montana. You have your hands full, man. And I -- looking at -- at the map, all away from, you know, Poverty Flats and Crooked Creek, all the way up into Ruby and Hay Creek, and the other end of the state. But the big fires look like they're in Trail Creek and Alder Creek -- in those areas that are significant.
And I got -- I have a simple question, and it's a complicated one, but what can we do for you that -- that we're just not getting done now? What additional help can we give you now that -- that is not -- not there yet?
I mean, cut through all the -- all the jargon about, you know, all that we policy wonks are talking about various programs. Bottom line: What do you need and can we help -- you know, that we haven't?
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: Good morning, Mr. President, Madam Vice President. I want to thank you for the opportunity to join you, and I want to answer your question because there are some things we can do to collaborate and work closer together.
Just to give a moment of background: As we meet this morning, our heroic firefighters are confronting 19 largescale fires in Montana alone.
And to put that in perspective: Just since January 1st, we've had 1,600 fires start in Montana and we've burned about 220,000 acres. These wildfires threaten the safety of our communities.
That Poverty Flats fire that you mentioned, in the last week, burned from initial start to 65,000 acres currently threatening 1,200 households out in the Big Horn County area, our first responders. These devastate our local communities and the costs keep mounting. We've spent -- the state has spent $13 million since July 1st alone.
It could have been much worse. And this gets to your question, Mr. President. Without our state's commitment -- and we've shared this with Forest Service and BLM, and they've been very cooperative -- to aggressive initial attack, Montana -- without that commitment, we would have had many more largescale fires. And we ask that our federal partners join us in applying this operating principle. Whether it's a fire that starts on private, state, or federal land --
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: -- fires are easier to manage when they're smaller.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Mm-hmm.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: And when we get after them, we do much better.
As we continue to confront this wildfire season, we're also focused on addressing Montana's forest health crisis. We published, earlier this year, the Montana Forest Action Plan, which identifies 9 million acres of forest land with significant forest health issues and an elevated risk of wildfire. Of those acres at risk, we found about 4 million acres that would benefit most from cross-bounty [sic] -- boundary forest management.
Given the need to actively manage our forests, I've charged our Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to double the number of acres it treats with active forest management this year at 25,000 acres.
But this is just a starting point. We'll actively manage private, state, and federal land with a variety of treatment types, including thinning, logging, and prescribed burn.
We've also invested in 14 different cross-boundary projects in Montana this year. These projects demonstrate the importance of working together across ownership -- ownership boundaries to create meaningful, landscape-scale change. And using funds from the state's fire suppression account and the Forest Service State and Private Forestry Division, we'll expand existing work and jumpstart new activities.
But it's not up, totally, to us. We ask that our federal partners join us in doing what needs to be done year-round to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires.
Of the 9 million acres at high risk, 60 percent of those are on federal land. This makes tools like the Good Neighbor Authority and stewardship contracting more important than ever.
The benefits are really clear: We have healthier forests, improved wildlife habitats, more recreational opportunities, and more good-paying jobs, and, most importantly, less severe wildfires. Without active forest management, we can't be successful in our forest health improvements.
In closing, I just want to say -- I want to thank our federal partners. We have good collaborative relationships here in Montana with the Forest Service and BLM. I also want to thank Governor Newsom and Governor Cox for sending crews to help us deal with these fires that are currently burning. We have thousands of first responders on the frontlines, right now, protecting our communities, natural resources, and livelihoods across Montana, across the western United States.
So many people have sacrificed, and I can't thank them enough. We can't measure it in dollars spent or acres burns -- burned. We have to keep them and their loved ones in our thoughts and our prayers.
I agree with you, Mr. President. Now is the time to act. I think it's all about aggressive initial attack and getting more proactive in our forest management.
Again, Mr. President, Vice President Harris, I want to thank you for letting me join you today.
THE PRESIDENT: Greg, let me ask you another question, if I may. There's press in the room, and lots of times, I know I do and we all do, use terms which those of us who are in public office -- whether it's President, Senator, Governor, et cetera -- use, and I don't think -- understandably, the American people don't fully understand what they mean. And -- and even I -- sometimes the press has so much to cover, I'm not sure they --
You talked about the Forest Health Plan. And talk about, as I say to my staff all the time, in plain English, what's that mean. Explain a little bit what that means.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: Sure. So, we have many forests in Montana that have not had good stewardship. The growth has gotten to the point -- I can take you 10 miles west to the state capital in Helena and show you a federal forest where 90 percent of the trees are standing dead. They've been killed by beetle when --
THE PRESIDENT: Right. Right.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: And this really creates a tinderbox situation. It reduces habitat. So. very -- very little wildlife lives there. And when we get a lightning strike or a campfire out of control and a fire starts in a forest like that, we put firefighters at risk. They're very hard to control.
The state has been very proactive. We -- the state has about 5 million acres. We've been very active in being stewards of those grounds. And when we thin a forest -- this is not clear cuts --
THE PRESIDENT: Right.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: -- but when we thin, when we remove excess fuels, water comes back into surface streams, wildlife comes back into that community. And when wildfire goes through a managed forest, it doesn't then get into the crown. It doesn't burn as hot. We don't have the devastation. And structures aren't threatened. So everybody wins when we have good stewardship of the forest.
THE PRESIDENT: That's really important. I -- believe it or not, I knew that. But that's really important for people to get it. Because we talk about thinning out the forest. We're talking about a lot of trees, because of climate change as well, where you have bugs, insects, eating up the trees as well, making things that -- that are changing and killing the forest themselves, and they become real tinder. And it's like, you know, dropping a match in a -- you know, in -- almost like in a pool of fuel.
And so going in and cutting all that out is not the same as going in -- I'm glad you made the point of clear cutting -- going in and just --
So I -- look, we do have, and we're -- I'm hopeful that we're going to get a lot of the infrastructure plan passed and the Recovery Act that has a lot of money in here to help you all manage these forests and to have much more money in there for the -- for the Bureau of Land Management -- anyway -- to be able to give you the help you need. Because your state, which I've been through, is a magnificently beautiful state.
It's -- and, I mean -- and the thing -- you know, you -- I come from the state of Delaware. And, you know, you had -- we had more acreage burned last year than the state of Delaware and Maryland combined -- combined. For you all out in Montana, that ain't (inaudible). (Laughs.) But I want people to get a sense of how massive -- how massive these fires are and how they affect water systems and --
Anyway, but that's -- I'm sorry to take your time, but I wanted you to be able to explain that so people understand that are listening to this.
Let me ask you -- let me ask you, Governor Inslee: You know, you've been talking about the impacts of environmental change for a long, long time. And one of the things -- and I asked him to show me -- to get me a map of where all your fires are in your state. And when you have Delancy and Cub Creek 2 and Cedar Creek -- I mean, they're massive fires. Massive.
And what are -- you know, as you look at what's transpired over the past month and you look at the road ahead of this wildfire scene, what is your biggest concern, Jay? What is your biggest concern? And again, I ask you the same question: What is the thing we can do most? I mean, you go all the way from Delancy down to ""Lil' Crick,"" as they say -- in the Creek -- you know down in the southwest -- southeast part of your state. What are -- what are your biggest concerns?
GOVERNOR INSLEE: Well, first off, thanks for your leadership, Mr. President. It is so refreshing to have a President who really cares about the Western Forest.
My biggest concern might surprise you because all of the governors share these immediate concerns. We have a huge need for additional aerial assets, additional dozer bosses so we can get our dozers into fire lines. We need new tra- -- more trained people. We do have an emerging concern about our fuel supply for our aerial assets. Everything we need to fight forest fires is in dire need across the Western United States, not just in Washington State. We've had a thousand fires. It's burned four times more at this time of year than normal. We've had two and a half times more acreage burn in the last decade than the previous.
So those are the obvious concerns. And everything you need to fight a fire, we -- we could use your help on. And I think you've been totally on top of this, and so I thank you for your leadership on all of these things, including management issues. There's unanimity, there's bipartisan acceptance of the need for active management. We're acti- -- we're managing our forests, just like Montana is, to try to get in and reduce fuel.
But here's the surprising thing, when you asked me this question, or the thing that I worry most about: The thing I worry most about is if, for some reason, the Congress did not follow your leadership in this reconciliation and infrastructure bills that allowed you to realize your vision of creating millions of jobs while fighting climate change. That's my biggest worry right now. Because the fact of the matter is there is nothing in human intervention against these fires while climate continues to ravage our forest.
You know, we used to think of these things are forests. They really, now, just fields of fuel, and they're fields of fire with just one spark because they're so dry. And that aridity creates something like gasoline on the floor of our forest.
There is only one way to prevent these forests from being gone in the la- -- in the next century effectively, to be totally unrecognizable, and that is to succeed in following your vision in the reconciliation bill for a clean energy standard, for a huge transition to the electrification of our transportation fleet, to a civilian climate corps.
And so, I want to tell you we are going to be with you, as you stand tall, while you negotiate this reconciliation bill to say, ""Look, we have to have those climate investments. There is only one way to save these forests from the ravages of climate.""
Our own federal scientists have said that if we accept a one-degree centigrade change, we'll have 600 percent increase in these fires on a regular basis. We won't recognize these forests as forests anymore unless we succeed with your vision.
So when you start having those discussions with Mr. Klain and Steve Ricchetti and everyone else at the end of the reconciliation process, you got to know you're going to have an army behind you standing tall for those things.
Now, there's some other small things that I'm talking to your staff about, about having better independent assistance for towns like Malden that burned down. There's some other coordination.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
GOVERNOR INSLEE: But that's the thing that's going to ultimately decide whether these forests survive in the next century.
Thanks for your leadership, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you for saying that. But, you know, one of the things that I say to all your colleagues: When I -- when it was proposed to me by some folks that we should have a Civilian Climate Corps of thousands of young people trained to do these things and -- at first, it didn't -- you know, I said, ""Yeah, yeah, that sounds good."" And then I started looking at it.
And the truth of it is, it's not fundamentally different, in terms of the help it can provide across the board training a lot of these -- I'm talking about thousands of young people getting paid to be trained and trained well for a very -- it's not -- it's not fundamentally different than the Civilian Corps put together in the Depression that was -- had a different purpose. They were building a building. They were doing a whole range of things.
But I just think I'd encourage -- and also, we'll send it to all of you. But all you governors -- Democrat, Republican -- take a look at it and see if you think I'm -- you know, I may have -- you know, as my mother would say, my eyes are bigger than my stomach. You know that I may have a bigger appetite.
But I -- I really think it can -- can be helpful. And there -- again, I say to your colleagues, there's a lot of money in here to be able to deal with your immediate needs as well.
But, anyway. Thanks, Jay. And I'll get -- I know you have this, but I want to get --
GOVERNOR INSLEE: Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT: -- more of it to you.
And, Gavin, I -- or, Governor, you know, I applaud your your -- your establishing the Wildfire and Forest Resilience Task Force, which I've learned is co-chaired by your Secretary of Natural Resources. I think it's a great example of being able to coordinate federal, state, local because this is getting real -- this is -- this is getting -- this is -- this needs a lot of coordination.
And I understand that PG&E, which provides electric to 17 million of your folks -- I understand they recently announced underground 10,000 miles of power lines. Is that -- is that true? And what's that going to do to the cost of energy in your state? And -- I mean, because that's expensive stuff.
GOVERNOR NEWSOM: It's a million to three and a half million dollars a mile to --
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
GOVERNOR NEWSOM: -- underground in California. Do the math on 10,000 miles.
Of course, do the math on decades of neglect. Ten thousand miles is a drop in the bucket. They have 106,000 miles of distribution line. Twenty-five thousand just in high-risk, fire-prone areas which will only grow. That's a 10-year commitment. It's important, but I want to put it in perspective.
I also want to put something else in perspective. Your eyes, Mr. President, are not wider than your stomach. California is proving your theory. Over a year and a half ago we established the Climate Corps in this state. It's inspiring beyond words. It's also inspired the philanthropic sector --
THE PRESIDENT: It really is, isn't it? I mean, it's not a joke. It is inspiring when you see it. I mean, it's incredible, I think. But --
GOVERNOR NEWSOM: Absolutely. And it's the one thing this country needs more than anything else, and that's common experiences and to focus on the things that bind us together, not just divide us.
This transcends politics. We have kids from urban and rural parts of the state, across every conceivable difference, and they're advancing together in ways that truly are awe-inspiring.
So, Mr. President, that's -- that's a vision we can manifest. We're not asserting it; we're proving it.
In a small way, you have the opportunity to do it in -- at scale.
Look, I just want to briefly -- because there's so many of us -- a quick update. We're blowing past every record, and not in a good way. We're at over 5,700 fires year-to-date. We suppressed 59 just yesterday with some initial attacks. Over half a million acres already burned in California.
To put in perspective -- a record-breaking year. Last year, we were at 130,000 acres burned. We're at 504,000 as I speak to you today.
Here's the answer to your question. And forgive me for being so pointed again, respecting your time, but I want to be a little bit more specific.
Jay referenced it obliquely. Please pay attention to this fuels issue. We had to get our National Guard to get some emergency fuel supplies for our aerial fleet a week ago. This is a major issue, and it's not just impacting our aerial suppression strategies on the West Coast. It's increasingly, as you may know, impacting commercial aviation. It is a major issue.
Number two, we just simply need more boots on the ground. We can't do without you. We've got 7,400 people -- 7,400 already. We're not in fire season. Fire season in California is late September, October, into November. We're in July. We already have 7,400 personnel actively working to suppress fires.
Last year, the federal government asked us for over 5,000 mutual aid support that we could not provide. That gives you a sense of what the federal government wanted from California last year to send to other states. That should give you a sense of how far behind we are with federal support.
We have four DC-10s, Mr. President. Four. Now, DC-10s aren't the answer to every problem. They don't fly over 35 knots. They have restrictions; there are legendary restrictions. But the reality is there is four for the country, and we're competing. They're all contracted. We compete with you. We compete with other states. We don't even have access right now to DC-10s.
We lost that 747 -- that iconic 747 -- that now has been converted to a cargo plane. You've seen that in Australia, not just across the West Coast. That's now been grounded by a private contractor.
We are the largest civil aviation fleet for firefighting in the world -- California. We do not come close to having the tools in the air that we need. We need your support to su- -- to dramatically increase the aerial support, in addition to boots on the ground.
Final two quick points: Every year, we're competing -- and you have a lot of legislators that have been doing heroic work in Democratic states, governors -- and Republican states -- trying to get access to the Pentagon satellite technology for early detection. It's been a game changer for us. And we're getting it on a year-to-year basis, but it's hard. Every year, we fight to get a one-year extension on that access to a critical tool of technology.
I'd encourage you to help us so we're not just fighting every year for something that I think you would support and the Pentagon, at the end of the day, final analysis will approve.
But here's the final thing, and it's the elephant in the room. I was with Governor Sisolak two days ago in his state of Nevada. The reason why is we had a fire that was on federal property. Fifty-seven percent of the forest property in California is federal, just three percent under California jurisdiction. Three percent. Fifty-seven percent under U.S. Forest Service. U.S. Forest Service is spectacular. We have deep admiration and respect, but there's a culture that, too often, is, ""Wait and see."" We can't afford that any longer. This was a federal fire. They waited. And what we saw is the fire took off because we didn't put enough initial assets.
Greg was making an oblique point here. I want to be a little bit more explicit: We need your help to change the culture, in terms of the suppression strategies, in this climate, literally and figuratively, to be more aggressive on these federal fires.
That fire bled into Nevada and, obviously, impacted not just our two states, but deeply impacted the redundancy of this concern that comes out every year around jurisdictions and incident command and the imperative that we're all on the same page, in terms of those initial attack strategies.
So, forgive me for being longwinded, but I wanted to get those clear --
THE PRESIDENT: No, no that's -- that's why we're doing this. I want to find out what -- what's the greatest concerns you have.
And I will -- when this meeting is over, I will be on the phone with the Department of Defense and talking about the access to satellite capability.
And -- but -- I'm looking down the list here. All right, I will follow up with you, Gov -- or the Vice President will; she has a mild interest in California -- with all the points you just raised, and I -- and I do appreciate it.
Now, I want to get to each one of you, but we're going to ask the -- I think now is the time the press is going to leave the room. Am I correct?
(Press is ushered out.)",NA,"Joseph R. Biden, Remarks with the Vice President in a Virtual Meeting with Governors on Wildfires Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/351313 ",,,,,,,,,,,
29-Jul-21,Remarks on Efforts to Combat the Spread of the COVID-19 Delta Variant and an Exchange with Reporters,"THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Today, I want to talk with you about COVID-19.
Maybe the best way to start is: In a significant part of the country, you wouldn't have to take one of these off, you don't have to put one on -- like in my home state of Delaware, where I lived in New Castle County, where I was yesterday in Pennsylvania -- because people got vaccinated. They got vaccinated. They don't need a mask when the majority -- the vast majority of people got vaccinated.
Now, look, I want to talk about what's really happening -- what it means, what it doesn't mean, and what we need to do this week and the months ahead.
From the moment I was elected, I said I'd always give it to you straight from the shoulder, and we need some straight talk right now. Because there's a lot of fear and misinformation in the country, and we need to cut through it with facts, with science, with the truth.
So, what's really happening today?
After months and months of cases going down, we're seeing a spike in COVID cases. They're going up. Why? Because of this new form, this new variant called the ""Delta variant.""
This is a much different variant than the one we dealt with previously. It's highly transmissible, and it's causing a new wave of cases in those who are not vaccinated.
Our experts tell me that cases will go up further
before they start to come back down. But while cases are on the rise, they're not -- we're not likely to see, according to experts, a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most areas of the country.
So, you have to ask yourself: Why is that? Because 164 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of those most vulnerable -- our seniors.
So, there's a challenge, as we knew there could be. But there's also good news.
We've spent the last six months preparing for this possibility. The vaccines are highly effective. We have enough vaccine for everyone to get vaccinated.
And thanks to the American Rescue Plan and the hard work of the American people, we've administered over 325 million vaccination doses in the past six months.
We have the tools to prevent this new wave of COVID from shutting down our businesses, our schools, our society, as we saw happen last year.
I've said from the beginning that we will be guided by the science. So here's what the science tells us:
On Tuesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention -- the CDC -- announced its new mask recommendation in parts of the country where COVID cases are substantially high, where people didn't get vaccinated -- which they define as 50 new cases for every 100,000 people in a week.
The CDC recommends you wear a mask when you're in public and indoors, like work or in a grocery store. That's true for both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. Why? Because even if you've been fully vaccinated and protected from severe illness from COVID-19, you could have the Delta variant in your system
and spread it to someone who isn't vaccinated.
We need to wear masks to protect each other and to stop the rapid spread of this virus as we work to get more people vaccinated.
And I hope all Americans who live in areas with substantial or high case rates will follow the mask guidance that's being laid down by the CDC. I certainly will. And I have -- because this is one of those areas, in Washington.
And at my decision -- at my direction, all federal personnel and visitors to federal buildings will have to do the same thing.
As I've said from the beginning, a mask is not a political statement; it's about protecting yourself and protecting others. Masking is one defense against the spread of COVID-19.
But make no mistake: Vaccines are the best defense against you getting severely ill from COVID-19 -- the very best defense.
And you want to know how we put this virus behind us? Well, I'll tell you how: We need to get more people vaccinated.
Look, and it's important to understand what vaccines do and what they don't do. Put simply, the vaccines are designed to save lives and prevent severe illness. They're highly effective at both.
A hundred and ninety million Americans have had at least one shot. Of that group, about 90 percent are done now, and 10 percent are waiting for the second shot.
To those folks who have one shot but not the second: Go get the second shot. Even if you're overdue for the second shot, it is not too late. Go get the second shot now. Now.
The bottom line is: If you're fully vaccinated, you're highly protected from COVID-19. But I also know that many of you who are vaccinated are concerned about what's called ""breakthrough cases."" Yes, some fully vaccinated people will still test positive, and some will show some symptoms of COVID-19. That's expected with almost every vaccine there is for other diseases.
But breakthrough cases remain rare and almost all are mild cases. In fact, virtually all hospitalizations and deaths are among the unvaccinated.
I also know many of you are wondering if you'll need a booster shot to add another layer of protection. As of now, my medical advisors say the answer is no. No American needs a booster now.
But if the science tells us there's a need for boosters, then that's something we'll do. And we have purchased the supply -- all the supply we need to be ready if that was called for.
Folks, the truth is, as more people get vaccinated, we are better protected as a nation to continue reopening safely and responsibly.
But we are not fully out of the woods yet, because what is happening in America right now is a pandemic -- a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Let me say that again: It's a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
There are about 90 million Americans who are eligible to get the shot but haven't gotten it yet. As I just mentioned, nearly all of the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19 today are from unvaccinated people.
Last month, a study showed that over 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths had been among the unvaccinated -- 99 percent. This is an American tragedy. People are dying and will die who don't have to die. If you're out there unvaccinated, you don't have to die.
Read the news and you'll see stories about unvaccinated patients in hospitals. As they're lying in bed, dying from COVID-19, they're asking, ""Doc, can I get the vaccine?"" And the doctors have to say, ""Sorry, it's too late.""
Right now, too many people are dying or watching someone they love dying and saying, ""If I just got vaccinated, if I just…"" It's heartbreaking. And it's complicated even more because it's preventable.
America is divided between the majority of eligible people who are vaccinated and those who are not. And I understand that many of you in the majority are frustrated with the consequences of the failure of the minority to get vaccinated.
But I want you to know that I'm going to continue to do everything I can to encourage the unvaccinated to get vaccinated. That includes addressing hesitancy and misinformation head on.
For example, I know some of you are -- who are unvaccinated think, ""The development of vaccine was rushed, therefore I'm not going to take a chance. As a result, I think it's not safe because it was rushed."" I understand.
But let me explain. Our top scientists at the National Institute of Health -- the NIH -- and across the country got to work applying decades of research -- decades of research -- let me repeat that: decades -- that have already been done -- the research -- to develop the COVID-19 vaccine when it hit.
In the last six months, more than 325 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the United States and billions of doses administered around the world. The vaccine was developed and authorized under a Republican administration, and has been distributed and administered under a Democratic administration.
The vaccines are safe, highly effective. There's nothing political about them. Look at all the people who took a shot at it. They later -- we learned a lot of them have already been vaccinated.
From the start, I have to compliment Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He hadn't made it political. He's encouraged people to get vaccinated and is continuing to do so, and his state is in pretty good shape.
Alabama Republican Governor Kay Ivey recently spoke out to encourage vaccination.
And even the commentators on Fox who have been belittling this for a long time -- some haven't, but many have -- are arguing, ""Get vaccinated.""
Look, this is not about red states and blue states. It's literally about life and death. It's about life and death. That's what it's about.
You know -- and I know people talk about freedom. But I learned, growing up at school and from my parents, with freedom comes responsibility. Your decision to be unvaccinated impacts someone else.
Unvaccinated people spread the virus. They get sick and fill up our hospitals. And that means if someone else has a heart attack or breaks a hip, there may not be a hospital bed for them.
If you're unvaccinated, you put your doctor and nurses at risk -- the same frontline, essential workers who put their lives on the line over the past year and have gone through hell.
Again, with freedom comes responsibility. So, please, exercise responsible judgement. Get vaccinated -- for yourself, for the people you love, for your country.
I'm being literal when I say this: As I travel the world, almost every day a foreign leader calls me, asking can I provide his or her country more vaccines. Their people are desperate for vaccines.
I'm doing everything to answer those calls. We're sending millions of vaccines to people around the world. But, folks, it's an American blessing that we have vaccines for each and every American. We've made it our first and top priority to have available vaccines for every eligible American and that's never going to change as long as I'm here.
And it's a shame -- it's just such a shame to squander that blessing. That's why after six months of extraordinary work and effort, today I'm laying out additional steps we should be taking to deliver these lifesaving vaccines to more Americans.
First, we're going to provide more incentives to encourage unvaccinated Americans to get vaccinated. That starts with paid leave to get the shot. We're still hearing that people are unable to get time off from their employer to get vaccinated. Well, this is unacceptable.
For some time now, I've said you should be able to get the shot and still get paid. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, the federal government is fully reimbursing any small- or medium-sized business that provides workers with paid time off to get vaccinated.
Employers, this costs you nothing. If you haven't given employees paid time off, do it now, please.
Today, I'm announcing that we're taking this a step further. The federal government will now reimburse those employers to give their staffs -- who give their staffs time off not only to get themselves vaccinated, but also to get their family members vaccinated.
That means employers can get reimbursed if they give parents time off -- with paid time, paid leave -- to take their kids or their own parents to get vaccinated. So, I'm calling on all employees [employers] across the country to give paid time off to get the shot or to help a family member do so. I promise you: It will cost you, the employer, nothing. You'll be reimbursed.
Secondly, I'm announcing that we'll continue the work -- to work with states to encourage unvaccinated people to get vaccinated. In February, the grocery store chain Kroger's offered $100 to their associates if they'd get vaccinated. And it worked. Vaccination rates moved up from 50 cent [sic] -- 50 percent to 75 percent among their employees.
States like New Mexico, Ohio, and Colorado are offering similar incentive programs that have helped increase vaccination rates.
So, today, I'm calling on all states and local governments to use funding they have received, including from the American Rescue Plan, to give $100 to anyone who gets fully vaccinated.
I know that paying people to get vaccinated might sound unfair to folks who've gotten vaccinated already, but here's the deal: If incentives help us beat this virus, I believe we should use them. We all benefit if we can get more people vaccinated.
But in addition to providing incentives to encourage vaccination, it's time to impose requirements on key groups to make sure they're vaccinated. (Clears throat.) Excuse me.
Just this week, we took an important step to protect our veterans. Like many civilian hospital systems are doing, the Department of Veterans Affairs will now require COVID-19 vaccines for doctors and nurses and other healthcare workers who provide medical care for our veterans.
We must do everything possible to protect our veterans from getting COVID when they come to get medical care they so richly earned serving their country. We owe them.
Next, since many vaccinations are required for active duty military today, I'm asking the Defense Department to look into how and when they will add COVID-19 to the list of vaccinations our armed forces must get.
Our men and women in uniform who protect this country from grave threats should be protected as much as possible from getting COVID-19.
I think this is particularly important because our troops serve in places throughout the world, many where vaccination rates are low and disease is prevalent.
Next, every federal government employee will be asked to attest to their vaccination status. Anyone who does not attest or is not vaccinated will be required to mask no matter where they work; test one or two times a week to see if they have a -- they have acquired COVID; socially distance; and generally will not be allowed to travel for work.
Likewise, today, I'm directing my administration to take steps to apply similar standards to all federal contractors. If you want to do business with the federal government, get your workers vaccinated.
Look at the Chamber of Commerce representing tens of thousands of American businesses. The National Association of Manufacturers. The Business Roundtable, which is comprised of the largest and biggest corporations in America. They're all applauding the actions the federal government is taking, and I urge them to follow suit.
I also commend the National Football League that has announced that if there are outbreaks among unvaccinated players and personnel, then the team risks forfeiting games. I urge other sport leagues at every level to take every step they can.
Every day, more businesses are implementing their own vaccine mandates. And the Justice Department has made it clear that it is legal to require COVID-19 vaccines.
We all want our lives to get back to normal, and fully vaccinated work places will -- will make that happen more quickly and more successfully. We all know that in our gut. With incentives and mandates, we can make a huge difference and save a lot of lives.
I also want to speak to families with children in school. We can and we must open schools this fall full time. It's better for our children's mental and emotional wellbeing, and we can't afford another year out of the classroom. Every school should be open, and we're giving them the tools to be able to do so safely. Even in those areas where they have a higher vaccination -- they have a higher rate of COVID.
Through the American Rescue Plan, we've provided schools billions of dollars to implement safety measures: better ventilation, social distancing, and other measures.
In March, when vaccinations were scarce, I prioritized teachers and school workers by utilizing our Federal Pharmacy Program. Almost 90 percent of educators and school staff are now vaccinated.
Additionally, the CDC has provided clear guidance on how all schools can safely protect the kids and bring them back to the classroom: every student wear a mask. It's that simple.
So, we've funded safety measures at schools, we've vaccinated teachers and staff, and we can mask up our kids for further protection.
But once again, there's one more thing we need to do: Get more adolescents, ages 12 and up, vaccinated now that they've been cleared. In the past week, the good news is we're seeing the average number of 12- to 17-year-olds getting vaccinated go -- increase 22 percent per day.
Today, I'm asking school districts to host one last pop-up vaccination clinic over the coming weeks for kids ages 12 and up. We're directing the Federal Pharmacy Program to help make that happen.
Parents, get your children vaccinated. You do it for so many other things right now.
And for kids under 12, if and when the vaccines are deemed safe for them, we'll be prepared to get the vaccines administered as quickly and as safely as possible.
Look -- and as we work to vaccinate more Americans, we're prepared for outbreaks in areas of -- where there are unvaccinated people.
My administration has made it clear to every governor that more federal resources are available to them. This includes the deployment of surge teams composed of ex- -- experts from the CDC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- the FEMA.
We're going to continue to provide states with more testing, treatments, protective equipment, personnel, mobile vaccination clinics to stem the surge of the virus among the unvac- -- unvaccinated.
The pictures of hospitals in several states overloaded with patients is unnecessary, avoidable, and tragic. You know, we'll help any health system overloaded and unable to cope with a spike in cases. We're ready to do that.
Let me close with this: If you're at home and vaccinated but anxious or even angry, or if you're at home and unvaccinated, unbothered and unconvinced, let's step back and see where we are.
Just remember how we've emerged from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer. But really remember just how dark that winter was.
Over 3,600 Americans were dying each and every day. And now, even with the surge among the unvaccinated, we're down to that -- 300 Americans a day. Significant.
Millions of people were out of work, out of homes, out of hope, and going hungry. Remember those long lines of people in their automobiles waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk?
Experts and pundits said we couldn't get the vaccines. And even if we could get the vaccines, we couldn't get them in people's arms and couldn't get them vaccinated. They predicted our economy would collapse. But remember how we stayed focused and how we went to work?
In six months, we got 164 million Americans fully vaccinated. And because we vaccinated so many people, put in place so many safety measures, and got economic help to businesses and people most in need, our economy is recovering.
More than 3 million Americans are back to work since I was sworn in -- a faster job growth than any previous administration. Any.
We're experiencing the fastest economic growth in nearly four decades. The best in the world as of now.
In fact, today's GDP numbers show that in the first half of the year, our economy grew faster than any point in nearly 40 years. Our economy grew more in six months than most Wall Street forecasters expected for the entire year before we implemented our plan.
And just yesterday, we announced a bipartisan infrastructure deal that's going to continue this momentum over the long term by making the most significant investment to rebuild America in nearly a century.
But we still have to face many challenges. We still have a lot of work to do as we readjust to a post-pandemic economy. But we have the right plan. We're coming back. We just have to stay ahead of this virus.
I know this is hard to hear. I know it's frustrating. I know it's exhausting to think we're still in this fight. And I know we hoped this would be a simple, straightforward line, without problems or new challenges. But that isn't real life. We're coming out of the worst public health crisis in 100 years, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
As I told you before, I carry a card in my pocket -- I hope I have it with me -- I have -- carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans dead from COVID-19. As of today -- this morning -- the total deaths in the United States were 609,441. Granted, the death rate per day is way down; it's down to 400, about, dead.
But that's more deaths than World War One, World War Two, Vietnam, 9/11, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars combined. This is as tough as it gets.
We're Americans. When we get knocked down, we get back up. That's who we are. That's what we do. That's why there's no nation on Earth like us.
And we're prepared like never before. We have the tools to save lives, to keep our economy growing and growing and going.
After the past six months, following the science, we know we can dramatically lower the cases in this country. We can do this. We brought our economy back to life, and we kept it going. We know we can send our kids back to school. We know we can beat this virus. We can do this. We all just have to do our part.
My fellow Americans, this nation has never failed when we have come together as the United States of America. So I say to all those who are unvaccinated: Please -- please get vaccinated.
And to the rest of America: This is no time to be despondent or let our guard -- our guard down. We just need to finish the job with science, with facts, with the truth. And together, as Americans, we're going to be able to beat this.
May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Thank you.
Q: Mr. President, how long do you think it might be necessary to wear masks? And at what point do you think people might have to have a booster shot? Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT: I said it in my talk: The booster shot is not needed now. It is possible that it will be needed later. I don't know -- they don't -- the science hasn't dictated that yet. And the fir- -- first part of your question?
Q: How long do you think people might have to wear a mask again?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, if you notice, a lot of places, people don't have to wear masks. Let's get that straight. The places where people have gotten vaccinated, where we have a high vaccination rate, people do not have to wear a mask at all.
Like some of you were with me yesterday when I was up in Lehigh Valley. Didn't have to wear a mask there. Don't have to mask if you come home to Delaware with me -- I know you love doing that. But you don't have to wear a mask. The places people are probably going to have to wear masks: in those communities where the high rate of unvaccinated stays high and they don't move -- they don't move to getting vaccinated.
But I think you're going to find the patience of businesses and the patience of a lot of other people running thin. Because the fact is, if you had high vaccination rates, you -- we wouldn't be in the spot right now.
Yes.
Q: Mr. President, will this set up a -- an American workplace for federal workers and private sector that really is the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated? And is that a pressure you're trying to harness now?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, I'm not -- look, what I'm trying to do is keep people safe. I mean that sincerely.
So, if in fact you're unvaccinated, you present a problem to yourself, to your family, and to those with whom you work. Because as pointed out -- I was asked the question about, ""Why would people who have already been vaccinated get it?"" Well, you got anywhere from 2 to 3 percent, on average -- the last study done -- that can still get COVID. They don't get very sick. They don't get hospitalized. It's not serious, but they can catch it.
And the concern is they may be able to pass it on. And so, that's all being studied right now. But it's important -- thing is, if people are vaccinated, the transmission rate drops through the floor. And that's all we're trying to do.
Yes.
Q: Mr. President, thank you. Why not push for vaccine mandates in states, private companies, schools? Do you want to see those entities pass vaccine mandates?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I -- I'd like to see them continue to move in that direction, and that's why I point it out. I had asked the Justice Department to determine whether that is -- they're able to do that legally, and they can. Local communities can do that. Local businesses can do that.
It's still a question whether the federal government can mandate the whole country. I don't know that yet.
Q: Mr. President, you said, earlier this week, that we are not headed back towards lockdowns. But if the science is evolving, how can you be so confident in that? You heard -- we heard you saying, weeks ago, that ""the virus [was] on the run,"" but Dr. Fauci has also indicated that we are headed in the wrong direction.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, you're take -- you're literally correct on everything you said, but it doesn't make -- come to the conclusion you're implying.
It is clear that if everybody is vaccinated, the existing vaccines work to prevent death, serious illness, hospitalization. Okay? If every -- so, if tomorrow I can wave a wand and every American was vaccinated, then in fact we'd be out of the woods.
Now, can something else happen a year from now? Can there be a different virus? Can there be something? It's possible. But I'm talking about COVID and the existing variants that have come forward so far.
So, it makes a -- it's a simple proposition: If you're vaccinated, you find yourself in a situation where you are -- highly unlikely, even if you somehow get the virus; very small percentage do -- that you are not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be on a ventilator, you're not going to be sick, but you could be in a position to possibly spread it to someone who wasn't if you have it in you.
Yes.
Q: Mr. President, thank you. I wanted to ask: Why not require that the people show proof that they're vaccinated? And also, if you could just -- with the 4 million, how much of an impact do you think this will have? Do you have a projection, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: A projection on what?
Q: On how many people will get vaccinated by putting in this system?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I can't -- I'm not going to get in business of projecting -- I -- exactly how many people are likely. All I know is that we go through these periods, then we run up against a wall, then something happens where people realize, ""Oh, my lord, this is really a problem,"" and they begin to see things.
Look, the fact that a lot of your friends are now saying, ""Get vaccinated,"" who were -- before were saying, ""This is not a problem. This is all a Democratic thing."" With a small ""d"" and a capital ""D."" I mean, there's a lot changing. People are becoming aware. The more aware they become, then we have these surges of people going out and getting vaccinated --
Q: But what about requiring proof --
THE PRESIDENT: -- and it just keeps building.
Q: I'm sorry, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: What about what?
Q: What about requiring proof, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, that is -- there's two ways to do it, and I think you're going to see some institutions doing that. Like you're going to fly abroad, you got to -- you're going to have to have proof. You're not just going to be able to say, ""Yeah, I got tested."" You got to pri- -- provide proof.
My guess is: If we don't start to make more progress, a lot of businesses and a lot of enterprises are going to require proof for you to be able to participate.
In the back. And then I'm going to take off, shortly here.
Q: What further actions are you going to take to encourage private businesses to follow this type of model to either require vaccines or require testing or other preventative procedures?
THE PRESIDENT: I just did. And I'm going to keep at it. I'm going to be talking about it around the country. I'm --
Q: Are you -- but are you going to reach out to private businesses, meet with them, try and actively encourage them to follow this model?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I have. That's why we have folks from the -- everyone from the Chamber of Commerce to the manufacturers, et cetera. So, you know, I am -- am I going to call a meeting of every, you know, business in the country to come to Washington? And -- or go on --
I have made the case repeatedly. I doubt whether there's a single, solitary business that doesn't understand that I think I think it's smart for them to require testing, require -- and if you -- if you can't demonstrate, you can't prove you've been vaccinated, you have to be tested.
Q: Secretary Austin said he was already considering mandating --
THE PRESIDENT: Yep.
Q: -- the vaccine after it was fully approved. Would you like to see the mandate go into effect before full approval? And do you think he's open to that?
THE PRESIDENT: I know he's open to it. And the question is: When is the right time to get the most bang for the buck when you do it? A lot of this is timing. And so, I think it's going to happen, but I -- look, the one thing that you all are politely and appropriately referencing is that it's still a temporary approval. So when does the final approval come? It usually takes a lot of -- a lot of work to get -- to get there.
I made a commitment I would not tell anyone in the Justice Department who they should prosecute and I would not tell the health industry that they -- excuse me, the government health entities what they should say and do. But my expectation is they're going to reach that conclusion in the early fall.
Thank you very much.
Q: Mr. President, one more. Mr. President, you said -- Mr. President, you said -- Mr. President, you said, ""If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask."" And it seems --
THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn't say that.
Q: You did. I have the quote.
THE PRESIDENT: I said if you're fully vaccinated in an area where you do not have -- well, let me clarify it.
Q: In May, you made it sound like a vaccine was --
THE PRESIDENT: Well, in May, that's true.
Q: -- the ticket to losing the mask forever, and it --
THE PRESIDENT: That -- that is true at the time, because I thought there were people who were going to understand that getting vaccinated made a gigantic difference. And what happen was: A new variant came along, they didn't get vaccinated, it was spread more rapidly, and people -- more people were getting sick. That's the difference.
Q: How is the First Lady, sir?

28-Jul-21,"Remarks on the Importance of American Manufacturing in Macungie, Pennsylvania","THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm not going to say anything; I just came to drive a truck. (Laughter.) And I'm not sure which one I want to drive. That one? There's one back in the corner you can't see. It's the biggest damn pick-up truck you ever saw in your life. (Laughter.) I tell you what.
Please, everybody have a seat. Everybody have a seat.
Carlo, thank you. And, Carlo, I'm sorry about your mom. I really am. So many -- so many people. Well over 630,000 Americans have lost their lives because of COVID. And the only thing I'm going to -- and the press keeps wanting me to talk about COVID, but I'm going to mention this one thing.
We still have a lot of people not vaccinated. The pandemic we have now is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. So, please -- please, please, please, if you're not vaccinated, protect yourself and the children out there. It's important.
And, Carlo, having been a significant consumer of healthcare myself and my family, I've often said this, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart: Thank your daughter for me. If there are any angels in heaven, they're male and female nurses. Not -- that's the God's truth. Doctors let you live; they make you want to live. Spent a lot of time in ICU, with my son on a table. Tell her, ""Thank you, thank you, thank you."" I really mean it. (Applause.)
And I want to thank Congresswoman Wild for the passport into her district. Where are you? (Applause.) As they say up in Scranton, she's bragging on y'all. They don't say ""y'all"" up there; they say that in Delaware. (Laughter.) You do because you got family from Alabama.
And you've been a tireless champion for the working men and women of the Lehigh Valley, helping us pass a tax cut for families with children that people are seeing now in their bank accounts, showing up in their bank accounts every month, and working with our administration to expand home care for seniors. We got a generation that's a ""sandwich generation"" between the child and a mom or dad needing help. And they need help. Provide better pay for caregivers.
And I want to particularly thank Bobby Casey -- he's a great friend of mine -- who champions this cause in the Senate for eldercare.
You know, John Mack started this iconic American company in 1890. But things didn't really didn't get off the ground until four years later when he brought his William -- his brother William down from Scranton. (Laughter.)
So, it goes to show you: If you want to get things moving, bring a guy from Scranton to get it going. (Laughter and applause.)
Mind if I take my coat off? I'm going to take my coat off.
You know -- and, folks, we're getting things moving. We really are. You are.
When I started my campaign for President -- and the Gov is still -- Gov, I didn't introduce you. I apologize. No, you're the governor of this state, and you're one of the best governors in the country. Thank you. (Applause.) And you're a good friend.
When -- when I said I was running when I announced my campaign -- and not many people took it seriously -- I said I was running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul of this country -- a sense of decency and honor; but, secondly, to rebuild the backbone of the country: hardworking, middle-class folks who built this country. And I want to point out: Unions built the middle class. (Applause.) That's not a joke. Unions built the middle class.
And, by the way, in case you regret anything, I just want you guys and women in union know that if it weren't for the UAW in 1972, I never would have won. You think I'm kidding. We had the largest percentage of union workers of any state in the nation in Delaware back then, including Michigan, because we're a small state and we had big plans. But, so -- so, before you get upset, remember, you're to blame why I got here. (Laughter.)
Look, folks, I think a lot of us come from similar backgrounds: moms, dads, brothers, sisters, family. People who get up every day, work hard, raise their families, pay their taxes, serve their communities, and serve their country.
And that's why I moved so quickly to pass the American Rescue Plan shortly after I got in -- elected. (Applause.) Because we needed to act quickly and boldly to save jobs, save businesses, and save lives. And we did.
We added more than 600,000 jobs per month since I've taken office. That's over 3 million jobs all told. (Applause.) It's the fastest job growth at this point in any administration on record because of you all.
We brought this economy back from the brink: checks in people's pockets, shots in people's arms, tax cuts for working families with children. And we designed our strategy not only to provide a temporary boost, but to lay the foundation for a long-term boom that brings everyone along.
Because when I arrived in office, we had a long time -- it's been a long time since the federal government had worked hard for working people. Things had been great for big corporations, great for the very wealthy, folks at the top. Those 55 major corporations for the past three years paid zero in federal taxes, making over $40 billion. They had no complaints.
But when I put my hand on that Bible on January 20th and took the Oath of Office, I made a commitment to the American people: We're going to change the paradigm so working people could have a fighting chance again to get a good education, to get a good job and a raise, to take care of that elderly parent and afford to take care of their children, and stop losing hours of their lives stuck in traffic because the streets are crumbling, or waiting for slow, spotty Internet to connect them to the world.
That's what the economy we're building is all about. Because given half a chance -- and think about this; I mean this from the bottom of -- given half a chance, ordinary Americans -- the people have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down, just given a half a chance. (Applause.) I mean it.
You may have heard that, in Washington -- and I was just on the phone -- it looks like we reached a bipartisan agreement on infrastructure -- a fancy word for bridges, roads -- (applause) -- transit systems, high-speed Internet, clean drinking water, cleaning up and caffing [sic] -- capping the orphan wells, over thousands of them abandoned, and abandoned mines -- and a modern, resilient electric grid to build.
And guess what? A lot of those abandoned wells are leaking methane. And guess what? The same union guys that dug those wells, they can make the same union wage capping those wells. (Applause.)
And I'm working with Democrats and Republicans to get this done, because while there's a lot we don't agree on, I believe that we should be able to work together on the few things we do agree on. (Applause.) I think it's important.
In addition to the physical infrastructure, I also put forward a thing called Build Back Better plan, with investments that are going to really -- if I said to you, ""You could have the following: We're going to be -- build you a lot of new roads and bridges, or I can make sure we're going to educate your kids so we're the best educated population in the world,"" what do you think would most impact on the growth of America? You'd be the most educated nation in the world. So I'm insisting that we have universal pre-kindergarten, two years of free community college. (Applause.)
All the studies show: No matter what background a kid comes from -- whether they're a single mom, a single dad who is on what we used to call ""welfare,"" are in trouble, or come from a middle-class household -- the kid who comes from the background that's deprived is going to hear, by the time they get to first grade, a million fewer words spoken. A million fewer spoken. What that means is they're behind the eight ball from the start. And a lot more.
But we found out if you put kids in not -- not daycare but in school at age three, four, and five, it increases by 58 percent the chance, no matter what their background, they'll make it through high school and qualify to go on to community college.
Folks, we need more affordable childcare. There are a lot of women not working today because they can't get -- go back to their jobs because they have no one to take care of their children; they can't afford it.
I was a single dad for five years when my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, my two little boys were badly banged up. I commuted back and forth to Washington because I couldn't dare leave and move to Washington because I didn't have my family to help me take care of my kids. I was making a good salary -- $42,000 a year then. And guess what? I couldn't afford care -- daycare for my children.
Eldercare: How many of you know somebody, has a mom or dad that needs help just because they're getting older and maybe still has their home but would rather stay in their home, increase their mental state, put them in a position where it's better for their health, but you can't figure out how to keep mom home alone, how to do it -- or dad? Well, eldercare is a big piece of this.
Paid leave: We're one of the only industrial countries in the world that you don't get paid leave if you have a sick son, daughter, mother, father, wife, husband, to have some time to take care of that.
Bring more people into the workforce, enhance our productivity, raise wages, and bring down the cost for working families.
You know, I was born up in Scranton, and my dad worked up in Scranton. He was actually from Baltimore, but he worked in Scranton and met my mom (inaudible) dad moved there.
And when coal died, everything died in the Valley, so he had to leave and look for a new job. My dad used to have an expression when we got down to Wilmington. First thing he did -- he got a job scrubbing the inside of boilers for a thing ca- -- often called ""COW"" -- the COW corporation.
We finally got to the place where -- we get to the place after five years we could afford to buy a small house -- actually, six years. My dad used to say, ""Remember, Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community."" I give my word to what he'd say. And it's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ""Honey, it's going to be okay,"" and mean it.
Because we know that trickle-down economics has never worked. But when working families do well, everybody does well, including the wealthy. Everybody. (Applause.)
Today, I'm here to talk about a commitment that's sacred to me and central to our efforts to keep things moving. It's a straightforward solution: support and grow more American-based companies. (Applause.) Put more Americans to work in union jobs. (Applause.) Strengthen American manufacturing and secure critical supply chains. And confront the climate crisis, which is all about jobs.
I can sum it up in two words: Buy American. (Applause.) Buy American.
You know, what most people don't know -- no matter how informed they are, most people don't know that for literally almost a century, there's been a law on the books in America called the Buy America Act. It's supposed to make sure that when your government spends your tax dollars in buying goods that they have to be goods that were built, purchased in America.
But the previous administration didn't take it so seriously -- in previous ones, not just the last one. They were quick to say, ""You know, we have a lot of money to spend. We got to buy -- the government is going to buy everything from buildings to aircraft carriers to trucks to whatever it is. But we can't find an American company that can do it all, so we're going to have to issue a waiver. We'll hire the American company, but that American company is going to have a subsidiary overseas where non-American -- Americans don't work, where it's much cheaper, they can make more money, and they're going to say, ""We have to have that as part of the chain of building the product.""
The result has been tens of billions of dollars didn't go to jobs and businesses in communities like this one.
In recent years, ""Buy American"" has become a hollow promise. But my adma- -- my administration is going to make ""Buy American"" a reality. And I'm putting the weight of the federal government behind that commitment with Made in -- in the White House itself, we put in a Made in America Office to oversee -- not in an agency, in the White House itself -- to oversee these efforts.
In my first Cabinet meeting, I told all of the Cabinet members if their agency wants to issue a waiver -- they're buying forest -- the Forest Department is buying trucks or hoses or whatever they need, okay? They've got to buy something that's -- all of it has been made in America.
And you can't give exceptions. Because if you say, ""We can't find one that does -- has…"" They get their nozzles overseas because they don't have anybody here who can make them, et cetera. I said, ""If you're going to give an exception, you got to tell the White House specifically why the exception.""
If they still want a waiver, they have to post the request on -- publicly so American manufacturers all over the United States -- and businesses -- have a chance to look up now in a new facility and say, ""Hey, they're for companies that make nozzles. They're looking for companies that make the following whatever. We make that. We make that."" And contact us. Then they can't take the job overseas.
And today, we're going to go further: We're going to make the biggest enforcement changes to the Buy American Act in 70 years.
Right now, if you manufacture a vehicle -- I expect you guys know about that -- that gets purchased by the federal government, the law says that -- and there's about 600,000 vehicles the federal government owns, by the way, and replaces and buys -- that ""substantially all"" of that vehicle -- ""substantially all"" should be made in America.
But because of loopholes, over time, you know what ""substantially all"" means today? If 55 percent of it was made in America, you can go ahead and get all of the rest of it purchased other places. To me, 55 percent is not ""substantially all;"" it's barely half.
And this is actually a double whammy. First, 55 percent is not high enough. And second, contractors don't have to tell us the total domestic content of their products, they just have to tell us that they hit the threshold. Nobody checking. Well, they got a new sheriff in town. (Applause.) We're going to be checking. No, I'm serious. I am deadly earnest.
Today, I'm directing the Budget Office to issue a rule to raise the amount of domestic content required to be considered Made in America from 55 percent to 75 percent. (Applause.) ""Substantially all"" is going to mean substantially all.
And starting with critical products, instead of taking contractors at their word that they hit the threshold, we're going to start making them give us the details so that we can do more to support American manufacturing.
We want to be the ones making the innovative parts of every product -- the ones that will support more jobs and more small businesses.
For example, I had a tour today. A lovely lady showing me in the parts where -- the second stop we made -- she said, ""Well, we're having a little problem. We're finding we don't have the computer chips that we need to go into the engines, et cetera."" We basically don't make them anymore in America.
So, I got together with a group of 20 Republicans and Democrats. We passed a new piece of legislation providing that South Korea and Taiwan open up plants here in the United States hiring American employees to make those computer chips so we're not held hostage. (Applause.)
In case you haven't noticed, not only you but Ford Motor Company said they're going to have to stop producing certain vehicles. They couldn't get the chips. Couldn't get the wafers.
And so I'm also directing my Budget Office to create new rules for critical products where we know we need stronger, more resilient domestic supply chains. We're talking about components like semiconductors, pharmaceutical ingredients, advanced batteries, among other things.
We saw during the early days of the pandemic that the supply chain disruptions can put Americans' lives and livelihoods at risk.
When we needed them most, we were short of protective equipment, we were short on ventilators and other essential health equipment. We couldn't get the job done. We couldn't take care of people. We were short on basic equipment.
I know a lot of you in this factory stepped up to make PPE at the time. That was a noble service, but it's not a long-term solution.
Yes, we'll keep trading with our allies, but we need to have a resilient supply chain of our own so that we're never again at the mercy of other countries for critical goods ever again. Ever.
You know exactly what I'm talking about. Right here, you've seen production slowdowns. As I've said, you've had your hours cut because of the shortage of computer chips and semi-conductors.
These chips are in more than just vehicles; they enable so much of our modern lives -- our smartphones, our televisions, our medical equipment.
That's why we're investing $50 billion to have the best chip manufacturing in the world come and build factories in the United States of America. (Applause.) And it passed the Senate, and it's called the CHIPS Act, and it's part of my Build Back Better plan. And it is bipartisan, as many Republicans are concerned about it as Democrats.
It's not just semiconductors. With this rule, we'll be able to buy medical products from companies like OraSure that are up -- that are down the road in Bethlehem -- or up the road in Bethlehem, I should say. I'm used to thinking from Scranton.
Their COVID-19 tests are being made right here, bringing good jobs along with it -- meaning that we're developing a homegrown capacity to respond to this pandemic and help prepare for the next one.
And, by the way, when I say ""Buy in America,"" I mean from all America. You know, we're going to include communities that have historically been left out of government procurement, when more contracts are going to go Black and brown communities, Native Americans, small businesses, every state and territory, every industry that services and manufactures, and also agriculture.
Part of the problem is that a lot of companies don't even know these opportunities exist to be part of this. And we've got to -- and we got to know -- I used to have a great friend -- a friend who's a great friend. He used to play for Providence College back in the days when they had great teams. His name was Pete McLaughlin, and he used to have an expression. And he wasn't the -- God love him. He passed away -- needed a heart (inaudible).
But anyway, the point is that what Pete used to say -- and academics weren't his thing -- he used to say something very streetwise. He said, ""Joe, you got to know how to know."" You got to know how to know. You can walk into the Library of Congress, one of the greatest libraries in the world, and if you don't know how to use the card catalog, figuratively speaking, it's just all happenstance. You got to know how to know.
So we started a new manufacturing contracting office in the Small Business Administration to help small- and medium-sized businesses bid on these contracts. And my Department of Commerce is working to help government agencies connect with new domestic suppliers in every state. That's how we're going to build a future that's made in America.
One more reason this is going to make a big difference: Each year, the federal government purchases more than $600 billion in goods and services. The Congress passes laws for purchasing things, and as President, I get to decide where we spend them and what we purch- -- what -- I mean, I purchase what was called for, but I get to -- and I'm the one who makes the decision -- the administration makes a decision on how to spend that $600 billion.
If American companies know that we're going to be buying from them, they're going to be more inclined to hire and make key investments in the future in their companies, like you're doing here.
My Build Back Better plan has incentives for electric vehicle adaptation [adoption], for increasing the amount of clean energy our government buys. And these Buy American rules can help guarantee a reliable market.
I just saw the work you're doing on the heavy-duty electric vehicles here, like electric garbage trucks. You know, there are more than 600,000 vehicles in the federal fleet, including the majority of -- the largest portion of which are at the post office.
As we work to electrify them -- as they run out, electrify them -- we're going to be making a market for vehicles with electric, supporting both the good jobs being created, as well as innovation we need to electrify our transportation sector and clean up our environment at the same time.
And we'll be expanding my Made in America initiative to help cities, towns, and Tribes get a better deal when they buy a ""Made in America"" product. It helps the towns, the taxpayers, as well as all of you on the floor of this significant place. It really does.
There are a lot of folks out there who look at how fast and how dramatically the world is changing and world economies are changing. I mean, who would have thought that 20 years ago you'd be making electric garbage trucks here? Seriously, think about it. But they accept it as gospel that working folks aren't going to -- aren't -- are going to get left behind; they're not going to be able to keep up.
Just the opposite. It's the opposite. Hardworking Americans are the ones who are going to make it happen. We got to invest in you. We have the most productive workforce in the world here. Given half a chance, there's not a single -- single thing you can't do.
So, I reject out of hand -- I've been criticized for this for some time -- but I reject out of hand this defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we can't have good-paying union jobs in America.
And right here, on this factory floor, you're making a product that are fighting climate change. That's why when I hear ""climate change,"" I think jobs.
Our manufacturing future, our economic future, our solutions to the climate crisis are all going to be made in America, creating good jobs. This's what it means to build back better.
We came out of this economic crisis -- the worst since the Depression -- stronger than when we went in.
America is one of the few countries of the world -- when we get smacked and knocked down, we get up, we come back, and we come back better than we were before we got knocked down. Now, I'm not joking. Think about the -- you know, the course of history in America.
And that's why, in the American Rescue Plan that we passed shortly after I took office, we're investing considerable sums that will go to cities and towns looking to build back stronger.
For example, towns in the southwestern part of this state can now apply for funds to cap those wells that are leaking methane, clean up abandoned coal mines, invest in bringing new employers into abandoned factories, and get help attracting them.
Let me close with this: Back in 2009, during the so-called ""Great Recession,"" the President asked me to be in charge of managing that piece -- then-President Trump -- excuse me, Freudian slip; that was the last President. He caused -- anyway, that was -- President Obama, when I was Vice President.
And the American auto industry, you remember, was on the rocks. And a lot of people, including a lot of Democrats, thought it wasn't worth investing tra- -- investing in them because the American worker wasn't that good, and they were blah, blah, blah.
I remember the heat that I took -- some of you may remember as well -- when I stood up and stepped into the rescue of the American automobile industry. My name was often taken in vain on television shows a lot, because ""Why is Biden so committed to the automobile industry?"" Well, because the fundamental mistakes that were made weren't made by the workers; they were made by management.
Today, a lot of the folks who said we shouldn't rescue the American auto industry are the same folks who are saying, ""We don't need to buy American."" What those people never realized is, if you give an American worker just a chance -- a fighting chance -- there's nothing they won't do. And if you give American companies and communities the chance, there's nothing they can't build. Just look around.
From the steel that raised our cities to these trucks behind me that are going to carry the economy forward, to the workers who are the heart and soul and spine of this nation -- American strength is here. It's in this region. It's you. It's not hyperbole. It's you.
And that's why I've told every foreign leader -- and I just got back from Europe meeting with heads of state. One said to me -- I said, ""America is back."" And he said, ""For how long?"" A head of state. And I said, ""You know, I want to tell you something: It's never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America. We never fail when we decide we're going to do something.""
So, today, I'm placing my bet on America. I know you all are going to make sure it pays off because it will pay off with good jobs, long-term employment, the ability for America to, once again, reassert its role as the most powerful economy in the world. And that is as important as the size of our military and as anything else we do. And if we think we're not in a race, well, guess what? Take a look at China. Take a look at China.
I spent an awful lot of time with Xi Jinping, President of China -- more than, I'm told, than any other world leader has. And he's made it really clear he doesn't think democracies can compete in the 21st century. And I spent over 25 hours alone with him over the period of the last five years -- seven years.
And guess what? Just come back from a conference with Putin. He thinks the same thing. Well, I got news for them: Autocracies will not succeed if we do what we can do as a democracy. Democracies.
And if you noticed, not a joke, a lot of the rest of the world is hedging their bets whether to move toward autocracy or stay with democracies.
We have it all, folks. We have everything that we need in this country to -- not only today, but for my grandchildren -- to be in a situation where we're still the most powerful physically and most powerful economic nation in the world that treats other nations decently and maintains the peace. That's who we are. That's America.
We're the most unique nation in the history of the world. Not a joke. By that I mean: Every other nation was put together based on ethnicity or religion, geography -- but not America. America is the most unique nation in the world, and literally, we're based on the ide- -- an idea. An idea is what formed America. And the idea was -- and it sounds corny, but it is absolutely true -- no other nation has this as their organizing principle: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal…endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights…life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""
We believe it. We've never accomplished it, but every generation that moved us closer and closer and closer to inclusion. That's why America's real power is not in the exercise of a military power, but people follow us because of our example. That's why the rest of the world follows us.
It was about time we get back up and reassert who we are. This is the United States of America. (Applause.)
Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",NA,"Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on the Importance of American Manufacturing in Macungie, Pennsylvania Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/332385 ",,,,,,,,,,,
27-Jul-21,"Remarks at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and an Exchange with Reporters in McLean, Virginia","THE PRESIDENT: It's an honor to be here. I guess you all are the ones that lost the lottery, huh? (Laughter.) You had to be here in person.
Well, I'd like to thank Director Haines and Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Christy Abizaid, for showing me around the watch floor.
Folks, the main reason I came -- and I mean this sincerely -- is to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. The American people, almost by definition, are not able to know what you do. And you devote so much of your time, your effort, and many of you end up risking your lives in the Intelligence Community to do things to make sure that your families and people back here are safe -- make a difference.
And you'd be amazed -- as I traveled the world as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or member of the Intelligence Committee for all those years, or as Vice President of the United States dealing with national security issues, or as President of the United States -- how many of now my foreign counterparts thank you for what you do.
I'd like to introduce you, by the way, to my National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Jake, would you stand up? (Applause.)
And, you know, the leaders of many of our intelligence agencies are here today. And I thank you for your diligence and keeping our country safe, and your commitment to supporting your teams. Because, if there's anything, a team sport is what y'all are doing if there's going to be anything that's going to be accomplished.
Because the people I most want to honor and thank today are the intelligence professionals whose names the public is never, ever going to know, never have any notion of what you've done for us: the analysts; the linguists; the collectors and field officers; scientists; support staff; so many others who are real experts, whose careers started much longer before my administration and whose service to our nation is going to extend well beyond my presidency.
You know, you're the eyes and ears around the world -- in the frontlines of our national defense, and in many cases, for the world, through us. And you serve the American people no matter which political party holds power in Congress or the White House. It's so vital -- so vital that you are and should be totally free of any political pressure or partisan interference. That's basic.
And I want to be absolutely clear that my administration is getting us back to the basics. To the basics. I promise you: You will never see a time, while I'm President of the United States, when my administration in any way tries to affect or alter your judgments about what you think the situation we face is. I'll never politicize the work you do. You have my word on that. It's too important for our country.
Getting back to basics also making -- to make sure the IC scrupulously acts within the legal constraints and abides by our strong traditions of internal and congressional oversight, including respect for whistleblower protections.
And it also means understanding that much of the work you must do is in secret but necessary and for the sake of safety. But we should strive to be as open as possible with the American people about the nature of the threats we face and just how serious they are -- and they are.
Every one of you joined up because you believe in being part of something that's bigger than yourself, especially you guys and women in uniform -- bigger than yourself. You're patriots. It's a word that we use lightly, but I mean it. It's not -- it's not -- I don't use it lightly. I really don't.
My son, who spent a year in Iraq and died, he was a patriot. He wasn't just somebody else. You all are patriots. You risk your lives and your sacred honor for all that we need to have done for us.
And you believe in the American idea. And living up to that idea is embracing democratic values that are our greatest strength at the end of the day, leading not just by the example of our power, but by the power of your example. The power of your example.
In addition to thanking you for your bravery, integrity, and your sacrifices, I want to make it clear to everyone here today and to the members of the Intelligence Community working around the globe that you have my full confidence.
That's doesn't mean I don't question what you send me. That meant -- doesn't mean -- it's not that I -- I -- you know, I'm not a new guy on the block in terms of these issues. But one of the reasons I question is to push -- push you to the limits to determine just how certain you are about what you're doing. Lots of times, the only honest answer: ""We're not certain. We're not certain, but this is what our best judgment is.""
I know -- I really do -- know how hard the work you do is. I've been doing this for a long, long time before I became President. I know there's no such thing as 100 percent certainty in the intelligence world. Occasionally that happens, but rarely, rarely, rarely.
But I also know that your work is invaluable to our ability to make informed, strategic national security decisions. And I just had an interesting meeting, as you all know, with my very close friend, Vladimir Putin. (Laughter.) I can tell -- one thing: I've been dealing with world leaders a long, long time. And just like all of you men and women, you can sort of sense somebody else after a while.
He knows that you're better than his team, and it bothers the hell out of him. Not a joke. Not a joke. And he, as a consequence of you, think we have capacities he may even exaggerate. That's a good thing. That's a good thing.
You know, one of the things I miss most during the four years between my time serving as Vice President and being a professor in a college -- and I mean this sincerely: From the time I was 31 years old, every morning I woke up and got in the train to come to -- I commuted every day from Delaware after my wife and daughter were killed. And I'd come every day, and one of the things I would get -- I'd get a brief in the morning. And I was more informed than 99 percent of the American people. You know what I miss most, for real, from those four years of being a professor? The PDB. (Laughter.) No, you think I'm joking. I am not. A sense of knowing where all the pieces were. Whether we had it all down, we knew where all the pieces were. We knew where the pieces were.
And so now I have access again -- and to the chagrin of many of you, I read it in detail. (Laughter.) And I ask questions of my briefers and follow up with my team. And I ask each of you the same thing I asked Director Haines, ""Just give it to me straight."" I'm not looking for pablum; I'm looking for straight-from-the-shoulder assessments. And when you're not sure, say you're not sure. But give me your best judgment of what you think is -- your best judgment is better than almost anybody else's judgment in the whole world -- even if the news is hard, even if the news is bad.
I can't make the decisions I need to make if I'm not getting the best unvarnished, unbiased judgments you can give me. I'm not looking to hear nice things. I'm looking to hear what you think to be the truth.
I greatly appreciate just how much work goes into the analysis that the IC produces and the tactical and intelligence supporting our warfighters and the superb effort to ensure our IT, our human capital, and the facilities are the best in the world. Because, again, without knowing what -- without you telling me, I don't know enough to know what to ask for from the Congress -- how much money we need, what we need to focus on.
It's a massive, coordinated, global effort to pull together reliable intelligence in a timely way. And all of you, no matter which agency you work for, are part of one team with one shared mission: keeping America strong and secure in the world, or simply making sure your families are safe. It gets down to basic things. Just really basic things.
You know, for most of the last 20 years, much of the work has been focused on counterterrorism, making sure the United States doesn't experience another horror like occurred on September the 11th. And that work has to continue and evolve to address the changing shape of terrorism as we find it today.
And that's no great insight on my part, it's going to change significantly more. It's going to change significantly more.
I always get kidded by my colleagues when I served in the Senate for 36 years for quoting Irish poets. They think I quoted Irish poets because I'm Irish. That's not the reason I quote them; they're simply the best poets in the world. (Laughter.)
And there's a famous poem written by -- that says, ""All has changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born."" The world is changing so rapidly -- technologically and in terms of alliances and human intercourse -- that war is going to change across the board in the next 10 years than in the last 50 years. That's not hyperbole; that's a fact.
If I talked to you 15 years ago about hypersonic flight, you'd look at me like I was crazy. So much is going to change and that's going to put an enormous burden on you to stay ahead of the curve. It's really going to get tougher.
But we have the best folks in the world. And one of the things that I think -- and I don't want to get off too far afield here, but one of the things that is really important is -- our greatest strength, in fact, is our diversity, bringing completely different perspectives to it. And I really mean that. That's not hyperbole. I'm not trying to be ""Kumbaya, everybody get along."" It's just a fact. It's a fact.
And so, threats that are more geographically dispersed than they were 20 years ago are going to continue to require our vigilance. And we have to continue our efforts to better understand some of the hardest and most important intelligence targets we face as a nation.
But, you know, we also need to make sure that we're positioning ourselves to stay ahead of security challenges that will stretch the IC in new ways it has never been stretched before.
You know, we've seen how cyber threats, including ransomware attacks, increasingly are able to cause damage and disruption to the real world. I can't guarantee this, and you're as informed as I am, but I think it's more likely we're going to end up -- well, if we end up in a war, a real shooting war with a major power, it's going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach of great consequence. And it's increasing exponentially -- the capabilities.
When I was with Mr. Putin, who has a real problem -- he is -- he's sitting on top of an economy that has nuclear weapons and oil wells and nothing else. Nothing else. Their economy is -- what? -- the eighth smallest in the world now -- largest in the world? He knows -- he knows he's in real trouble, which makes him even more dangerous, in my view.
Take a look at China. I've spent more time with Xi Jinping as a world leader than anyone else has. I spent 25 hours alone with him when I was Vice President because it was important that, according to President Obama, that someone knew who the new guy coming on board was, and it couldn't be the President.
I traveled 17,000 miles with him. I've sat with him, with me and just an interpreter -- each of us have a simultaneous interpreter. He is deadly earnest about becoming the most powerful military force in the world, as well as the largest -- the most prominent economy in the world by the mid-40s -- the 2040s. It's real.
I don't know. We probably have some people who aren't totally cleared -- I don't know, but you saw just what we found out about hypersonic -- we -- anyway, as they say in Southern Delaware, ""This boy has got a plan."" And, you know, we better figure out how we're going to keep pace without exacerbating and moving us in a position where we increase the hostilities unnecessarily.
I think we also need to take on the rampant disinformation that is making it harder and harder for people to access -- assess the facts, be able to make decisions.
In today's PDB you all prepared for me, look what Russia is doing already about the 2022 elections and misinformation. It's a pure violation of our sovereignty.
Now you see what's happening. More people get their information from the Internet than they do from any other outlet. What's -- all the disinformation that's having real consequences in terms of people's access.
And so, there's so much that you all -- particularly those of you who are new and coming along -- are going to have to be -- keep up with and ahead of in ways that are not even happening now, as good as everything is.
You know, as we compete for the future of the 21st century with China and other nations, we have to stay on top of the cutting-edge developments of science and technology.
If you'd hold for a second here, I want to point out something. You know, we used to -- we used to be, when I first got here as a U.S. senator, actually three and a half decades ago, we invested more money -- R&D -- money in R&D as a percent of our GDP than any nation in the world. We're now number eight. China was number nine; they're now number two. It matters. It matters.
Look at where we are on things that intelligence communities and others don't even think very often about -- about how educated the public is. We're coming around right now. This doesn't relate to the intelligence community per se, but it does.
Think about it. If we were having the debate that was taking place in the United States in the late 1890s and the early 1900s about public education, do you think any of us would say 12 years of free public education was enough to compete in the 21st century? Not a joke. Think about it. What do you think? I don't think there's a shot if we were doing that today.
So the fact we have the best-educated public in the world -- well, that's our objective -- will matter a great deal. It will matter a great deal. It is as much a part of national defense, in my view, as anything else is.
So I think we have to think differently. I don't expect you to agree with me. I expect you to at least understand where I'm coming from because the world is changing so significantly.
And it's especially important that we work closely with our partners and allies to maintain our technological edge; shore up supply chains; ensure that the rules that govern technologies support democracies, not autocracies.
You know, at the same time, we have to work in cooperation with nations like China and Russia that are our competitors -- and possibly mortal competitors down the road -- in the context of there's -- to meet the existential threats, for example, of climate change. There are certain things that are in our mutual interest. But we can't -- we can't be lulled into thinking that that's enough and that we don't really have to keep a watchful eye on what the ultimate objective of the other team is. But there are things where we should be -- where we should be cooperating.
This shared danger impacts all of nations. Climate challenges are already accelerating instability in our own country and around the world: extreme weather events that are more common and more deadly; food and water insecurity; sea levels rising, resulting in changing climates and driving greater migration and posing fundamental risk to the most vulnerable of communities.
If you could hold for just a second again. We're in a situation where -- think about this. Think about this: I'll never forget the first time I went down in the tank as Vice President, after I got elected. The Defense Department said what the greatest threat facing America: climate change.
If, in fact, the seas' level rises another two and half feet, you're going to have millions of people migrating, fighting over arable land. You saw what happened in North Africa. What makes us think this doesn't matter? It's not your responsibility, but it's something you're watching because you know what's going to happen.
People who were Muslim, and the only difference was Black and/or Arab, killing each other by the thousands for arable -- a piece of arable -- arable land in North Central Africa. But what happens -- what happens in Indonesia if the projections are correct that, in the next 10 years, they may have to move their capital because they're going to be underwater?
It matters. It's a strategic question as well as an environmental question.
A dramatically warming Arctic is opening up competition for resources that once were hard to access. I had -- as they say in Southern Delaware -- they talk at you like this, you know what I mean? -- I had a ""Come to Jesus"" meeting, an ""altar call"" with Mr. Putin about what he thinks is what Russia's property is in the Arctic. China looking very closely at that as well, where they are.
That's what I mean about the world changing. What is that going to do to our strategic doctrine in the next 2, 5, 10, 12 years, when you can circumvent the Arctic without icebreakers?
So, look, we need your insight, we need your expertise on all these issues. The one thing you all have in common is you all have high IQs. You're all smart. You have significant intelligence quotients, and you put it to use to help the elected leaders in this country decide what the best route to go is.
So just as you always have been essential as we've sought to counter traditional threats, the Intelligence Community is going to be critical to America's strength as we take on these new challenges and hybrid threats.
Finally, I've laid out a broad agenda, and that's just a fraction of it. But we can't do any of this without taking care of our best and most important asset: the American people.
I know the intelligence community is already one of the best places to work in the federal government. I asked my staff when I found out you came in second just after NASA -- I said, ""Don't tell me what the White House is ranked."" (Laughter.) ""It will hurt my feelings."" And they assured me, no, you don't rank them. That was a good thing: ""We don't rank the Oval Office."" (Laughter.)
But all kidding aside, it's about the comradery you have, and most of all, it's about being able to trust one another -- to trust one another.
My highest priority as President is the safety and security of all Americans, and that includes those who serve in our Intelligence Community.
You take on unique risks in these jobs, and we're taking the cases of anomalous health incidents that are affecting intelligence officers, government officials, and their families very seriously, for example.
My administration is coordinating a government-wide effort to respond to these incidents, because this challenge demands -- demands that departments and agencies, including the entire Intelligence Community, work together with urgency.
Talked about changes. What's going to happen as we move on and we're able to develop around the world pathogens that can be transmitted to societies and communities? It may not be a nuclear weapon. It may not be a hypersonic missile. It may not be any of the things we think of.
But think about it. Just think about what's happened with one -- I'm not suggesting it was intended -- a lot more we need to know -- but think what's happened: More people have been killed in the United States of America because of COVID than in every single major war we fought combined. Every single one. What's next? What is intended? There's a lot of research going on. You're going to find -- you're going to have to increase your ranks with people with significant scientific capacity relative to pathogens.
So, my point is: Your value is going to increase and increase and increase and increase in terms of security. You know, from the CIA to all the agencies, there's a lot that's going to happen.
And to all of you who've been affected, we recognize how important it is to make sure that they have the best possible care at a time you're figuring out how to deal with what's happening, not only to some of those who have been stationed abroad, but their families.
Look, this is a priority for our entire leadership team. So let me just close by saying how much I value the work you do. That's why I wanted to come here today.
So much of the work you do is in secret. It means many, many times you don't get credit -- the credit you deserve -- and the things you prevented from happening, the catastrophes you've enabled us to avoid, the judgments you've provided us to make our people safer.
And America is probably never going to learn about the lives you've saved or the disasters that never come to pass because of your diligent, professional intelligence work. But I want you to know I know. For the time being, at least as long as I'm around, I know.
And on behalf of the American people, thank you all for what you do every single day. And we're grateful -- we're grateful that you're there for us. We're safer because of your dedication, your honesty, your integrity, and your significant intellectual capacity to act in our interest.
We're stronger because of your insight. We're a more noble nation because of your insight. And American lives have been saved repeatedly because of your insight. I know it may sound like hyperbole, but from the bottom of my heart, I thank you. I thank you for all you do and continue to do.
And may God bless you all. And may God protect our troops and all those patriots serving in harm's way, because there's a lot still there. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)
I have to seek permission to leave. I had to check, if you noticed. (Laughter.) Thank you again. (Applause.)
Q: President Biden, will you require federal employees to get vaccinated?
THE PRESIDENT: Beg your pardon?
Q: Will you require all federal employees to get vaccinated?
THE PRESIDENT: That's under consideration right now. But if you're not vaccinated, you're not nearly as smart as I thought you were.
Q: Are you concerned that the CDC's mask guidance could sow confusion?
THE PRESIDENT: We have a pandemic because of the unvaccinated, and they're sowing enormous confusion. And the more we learn -- the more we learn about this virus and the Delta variation, the more we have to be worried and concerned. And only one thing we know for sure: If those other hundred million people got vaccinated, we'd be in a very different world.
So, get vaccinated. If you haven't, you're not nearly as smart as I said you were.

26-Jul-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting with Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi of the Republic of Iraq and an Exchange with Reporters,"PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, I'm honored to welcome the Prime Minister. We've known each other for some time. And welcome to the White House, welcome to the Oval, Mr. Prime Minister.
Iraq has been a vital part for the -- partner of the United States for some time now in the Middle East. And we've en- -- I've engaged deeply in Iraq for my entire career back in the Senate, as Vice President, and as President. And I've worked with Iraq to -- and matter of fact, my son Beau was in Iraq for a year with the Am- -- with the Army National Guard.
And the sacrifices that so many -- so many have made to build the U.S.-Iraq partnership has been real, and it's consequential. And my administration is committed to strengthening that partnership, Mr. Prime Minister.
And the U.S-Iraqi Strategic Dialogue is about commitments that expand our cooperation on issues like healthcare, climate, energy. For -- matter of fact, I wanted to tell you: I was told you -- the half a million -- 500,000 -- doses of COVID vaccine we're sending -- I was told you were told they wouldn't come for a while. They'll be there in a couple of weeks.
PRIME MINISTER AL-KADHIMI: Thank you.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: They'll be there quickly. And -- and, you know, we support strengthening Iraq's democracy, and we're anxious to make sure the election goes forward in October. And we're also committed to our security cooperation. Our shared fight against ISIS is critical for the stability of the region. And our counterterrorism cooperation will continue, even as we shift to this new phase we're going to be talking about.
I'm looking forward to consulting with the Prime Minister today. We have a lot to talk about. He's been a good friend. And I'm anxious to get going.
Floor is yours, sir.
PRIME MINISTER AL-KADHIMI: Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor to be here today with our American friends. We have strategic partnership. I'm happy to be here in Washington to discuss the future of our nation and how to improve this relation between our two countries.
America, they help Iraq. Together we fight to defeat Daesh -- ISIS. And I'd like to thank the American people on behalf of all Iraq's people.
Mr. President, I thank you for all the blood and treasure that America has given for a free and democratic Iraq.
Today, our relation is stronger than ever. Our partnership exists for economy, the environment, health, education, culture, and more.
I'm looking forward to work with you, Mr. President, to bring our two countries more closer for benefit of Iraq and United States.
God bless our two countries. Thank you, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you. Thank you, folks.
(Cross-talk by reporters.)
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Hang on a second. If you want to talk about Iraq, ask me a question about Iraq.
Q: How many troops would you like to see in Iraq by the end of this year? And how does the relationship changes, considering this is the last strategic dialogue that you have with Iraq and the Prime Minister?
PRESIDENT BIDEN: This most recent dialogue you mean.
Q: Correct.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, we've been talking a lot. Our foreign ministers, our Cabinet members have been talking. We're looking forward to seeing an election in October. We're working very hard with the Iraqi government to make sure the U.N. and the GCC are -- we have oversight; that there's -- these are full and fair elections.
I've been in -- I've been in contact with Kadhimi. I have -- anyway, I think things are going well. Our role in Iraq will be as a -- dealing with not -- it's just to be available, to continue to train, to assist, to help, and to deal with ISIS as it -- as it arrives. But we're not going to be, by the end of the year, in a combat mission.
Q: Mr. President, Veterans Affairs. Mr. President, Veterans Affairs is going to have a mandate for its healthcare --
PRESIDENT BIDEN: You are such a pain in the neck, but I'm going to answer your question because we've known each other for so long. It has nothing to do with Iraq.
Q: I take that as a compliment, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Laughs.) I'll answer your question. Yes, Veteran Affairs is going to, in fact, require that all docs working in facilities are going to have to be vaccinated.",NA,"Joseph R.

26-Jul-21,Remarks on the 31st Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act and an Exchange with Reporters,"THE PRESIDENT: Madam Vice President, Tyree -- you're an inspiration. Thank you for sharing your story.
Thirty-one years ago today, on the South Lawn of the White House, President George H.W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act. He surrou- -- he was surrounded by disability advocates and bipartisan members of the United States Congress, just as we are today.
Speaker Pelosi -- welcome, by the way, Madam Speaker -- Chairman Leahy, Leader McCarthy, Senator Casey, Congressman Scott, Congressman La- -- where is here? There you are, Paul [Jim]. You understand this better than anybody does. And I want to thank you, Congressman, for all your work. And I want to thank you all for being here.
Second -- by the way, where's mom? Mom -- is she here?
MS. BROWN: She's at home watching.
THE PRESIDENT: Oh, she's watching.
MS. BROWN: She's watching.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay. I thought she looked -- I said, ""Mom is out there."" I was going to ask her to stand up. But, Mom, you can't stand up if you're home. But, folks -- (applause) -- give you -- thank you for what you've done.
The Second Gentleman is here as well. Thank you for being with us as well.
And some of the same folks who fought so hard for this landmark legislation are with us today. I just got off the phone with one of them -- a guy named Tom Harkin. And yest- -- or two days ago, I was on the phone with one who just had his 98th birthday, Bob Dole. (Applause.) But no one worked harder than Tony Coelho to get this done. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.
Others weren't able to join us today but were instrumental in bringing this to life -- dear friends, as I said, like
Tom Harkin and Bob Dole.
And I also spoke -- as I said, Bob is -- wanted to pass on his regards, as did Tom. Tom is up in Wisconsin working on -- he said on ADA, doing something up there. Now, he didn't explain exactly what.
There are still more with us that are here in spirit, like Ted Kennedy, Major Owens -- Congressman Major Owens, and countless other advocates.
I was enormously proud to be a co-sponsor to the ADA as Pat Leahy was, as well, if I'm not mistaken, as a member of the United States Senate.
And I'm proud to be here today, as President, alongside so many fearless champions who represent the ongoing legacy of this law, from the foundations to its future.
Thirty-one years ago, after its passage, many Americans have never lived in a world without the ADA. Generations have grown up not knowing a time before it existed.
But many of us can still recall an America where a person with a disability was denied service in restaurants and grocery stores, and could be; where a person using a wheelchair couldn't ride on a train or take a bus to work or to school; where an employer could refuse to hire you because of a disability. An America that wasn't built for all Americans.
Then we passed the ADA and made a commitment to build a nation for all of us. All of us. And we moved America closer to fulfilling that promise of liberty and justice, and maybe most importantly, dignity and equality for all.
You know, and perhaps most importantly, we did it together. This was a Democratic bill signed by a Republican president. A product of passion and compassion, not partisanship. Progress that wasn't political, but personal, to millions of families.
I'll never forget the moment the ADA passed. And you may remember it, Pat. Standing on the floor of the United States Senate, and Tom Harkin saw the recognition -- he rose. And the first time -- first time in the history that I'm aware of -- in the United States Senate, he stood up and he signed in a speech to his brother. Tom wasn't just sending a message to millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing folks; he was speaking to his brother, Frank. It was personal to him.
It was personal to Bob Dole, as well, who lost the use of his right arm in a heroic effort during World War Two; who laid out in a hospital for almost three years -- his injury listed, and they also lasted an entire lifetime.
But like so many Americans, he turned his disability,
his apparent limitation, into greater purpose and will. He made -- he made the rights of disabled Americans a lifelong cause.
And for more than 60 million Americans living with disabilities, the ADA is so much more than a law; it's a source of opportunity, participation, independent living, and respect and dignity, the bulwark against discrimination, and a path to independence.
And for our nation, the ADA is more than a law as well; it's testament to our character as a people, our character as Americans. It's a triumph of American values.
But, of course, this law didn't bring an end to the work we need to do. Today, too many Americans still face barriers to freedom and equality. But thanks to this movement that spans all races, beliefs, backgrounds, and generations, we're once again making progress together.
In my first day in office, I was proud to sign an executive order establishing a government-wide commitment to advancing equity, including people with disabilities. (Applause.)
And I was proud to appoint the first-ever White House Disability Policy Director, Kim Knackstedt. Where are you, Kim? (Applause.) Where is Kim? Thank you, Kim.
And I'm ensuring that dignity and rights of disabled Americans are lifted up in every policy we purzue [sic] -- pursue, from continuing to make sure that this administration looks like America, appointing people with disabilities to positions across the government.
In the American Rescue Plan, we were able to include substantial support for schools that better serve students with disabilities, that -- expanding access to vaccines for disabled Americans.
As part of my Build Back Better plan -- it was already mentioned -- we propose $400 billion to expand access to home- and community-based care -- (applause) -- helping people with disabilities and older adults live more independently.
And I'm glad that Congress is beginning to move on the Better Care Better Jobs Act -- (applause) -- championed by my buddy, Bobby Casey -- Bobby, thank you -- which builds on that effort.
This past year, the entire nation saw just how vital our caregivers are and how critical home-based care truly is for so many Americans.
This legislation will help ensure that caregivers are fairly compensated for their work. (Applause.) In addition, I've also called on Congress to eliminate the discriminatory sub-minimum wage provisions -- (applause) -- that too often keep people with disabilities from getting good jobs with fair wages.
And because of additional executive orders I've signed, we're working to remove barriers that hold back disabled Americans from exercising their sacred right to vote.
And we're ensuring that the federal government is a model employer when it comes to wages, accommodations, and opportunities to advance people with disabilities. That's a firm commitment.
And today -- (applause) -- finally, I'm proud to announce a new effort -- the first of its kind -- to help Americans grappling with long-term effects of COVID-19 that doctors call ""long COVID.""
Many Americans who seemingly recover from the virus still face lingering challenges like breathing problems, brain fog, chronic pain, and fatigue. These conditions can sometimes -- can sometimes rise to the level of a disability.
So, we're bringing agencies together to make sure Americans with long COVID, who have a disability, have access to the rights and resources that are due under the disability law -- (applause) -- which includes accommodations and services in the workplace, in school, and our healthcare system so -- so they can live their lives in dignity and get the support they need as they continue to navigate these challenges.
We made important progress, but we still have work to do. We have to keep going to ensure that every single American has a chance to contribute their talents and thrive and succeed.
And I know that today's fearless advocates, some of whom are with us today, are going to accomplish incredible things.
People like -- like M- -- excuse me, people like Mr. Tootle. Where are you? (Applause.) Stand up, man. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You know, I want to thank you for your continued efforts to build an America for everyone, and as I said, you courageous advocates who led the way 31 years ago -- a long time before the foundation for progress is strong, though. It's part of the mor- -- moral bedrock of our nation and something every American should be proud of.
Now it's my honor to sign the proclamation on the 31st anniversary of the ADA.
I want to thank you all. May God bless you and all of you dealing with disabilities. You're -- you are an inspiration to all of us. I really mean it. You're an absolute inspiration. (Applause.)
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Now I'm going to walk over and sign this. I'm going to invite up, though -- Nancy, come on up. Steny. I think we ought to get you up here. You were -- you're a big part of it -- Tony Coelho. Am I leaving anybody out?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Pat.
THE PRESIDENT: Pat, you -- you were there at the time. Why don't you get your rear end up here and put your -- (laughter).
The Leader is taking his camera, because Pat would rather use his camera than, I think, anything else.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Come on.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, come on.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Come on up.
THE PRESIDENT: Tony, you get right in the back here. You were a big, big, gigantic part of this.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Pat, come on. Get in.
THE PRESIDENT: All right. The anniversary of the Americans with Disability Act 2021.
(The executive order is signed.)
(Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT: Tony. (Hands a pen.)
REPRESENTATIVE COELHO: Thank you.
LEADER HOYER: Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: Good to see you.
Madam Speaker. Pat.
SENATOR LEAHY: Thank you, sir.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And this hero right there.
THE PRESIDENT: I will, but I want to make sure I got all the --
(Gives pen to Ms. Brown.)
MS. BROWN: Thank you so much.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, everybody. (Applause.) Let's keep it going. (Applause.)
Q: Mr. President, would it be helpful if employers mandated vaccines, sir?
Q: Mr. President, do you have confidence you can get the unvaccinated Americans vaccinated?
THE PRESIDENT: We have to.
Q: How?
Q: Mr. President, are you confident there will be an infrastructure deal this week -- a bipartisan infrastructure deal?
THE PRESIDENT: You know me -- I'm always optimistic. Yes.",NA,"Joseph R.

23-Jul-21,"Remarks at a Campaign Event for Virginia Gubernatorial Candidate Terry McAuliffe in Arlington, Virginia","THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Virginia! (Applause.) It's so great to be back. First off, it goes without saying how much I appreciate your current governor, Ralph Northam, by the way. (Applause.) Because of the hard work of the American people, we've put ourselves in a position for us to control the virus instead of it controlling us.
Here in Virginia, COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are down 90 percent since January. (Applause.) Fifty-four percent of your population has been fully vaccinated, eighty-two percent of your seniors -- both of which are above the national average. (Applause.)
But this pra- -- this didn't happen by itself. It's due to the heroic vaccination program -- one of the greatest and most complex operational challenges in American history.
It happens when we all work together -- the federal government, states, cities, the private sector, and all of Americans.
Look, it happens when you have governors like Ralph who've been a key partner, coordinating FEMA and the National Guard to move personnel and resources around the state to get shots in arms. It happens when you're honest with people.
You know, I know folks are watching the number of cases rising again and are wondering what it means for them. Well, here's the truth: If you're fully vaccinated, you're safer with a higher degree of protection. But if you're not vaccinated, you are not protected.
And now -- (applause) -- what we have now is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And, by the way -- you know the old expression -- you notice a lot of our very conservative friends have finally had an ""altar call."" (Laughter.) They've seen the Lord, whether it's on Fox News or whether it's the most conservative commentators or governors.
Thank God the governor of Arkansas -- excuse me, of -- of Alabama -- had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country -- is now -- and I give -- I'm genuinely complimenting her --
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Stop line three! Stop line three! Stop line three!
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Joe!
THE PRESIDENT: That's okay. That's all right. That's all right. No, no, no, no. Let -- let him talk. No, let --
AUDIENCE: (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT: That's okay. Look, this is not a Trump rally. Let them holler. No one is paying attention to them. (Applause.)
Look, here's the point: Virtually all the COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are today among the unvaccinated people. And I know -- I know this has gotten a bit politicized, but I hope it's starting to change. It's not about red states or blue states or guys like that hollering; it's about life and it's about death.
And I know Governor Northam is going to work like the devil to finish the job. (Applause.) Thank you, Gov.
Look -- and, of course, it's great to be with another great friend that's been around -- I've been around a long time, and I've -- seldom do I get to campaign for someone who I've agreed with more on basically everything. We go back all the way to roots in Syracuse, New York. (Applause.)
I'm talking about -- and before that, I'm actually talking about Dorothy. (Laughter.) Her roots don't go there, but -- look, she's always been there for me and Jill when we've needed her most. She was an incredible First Lady of Virginia and she will be again. She is the very best. (Applause.)
And, Dorothy, speaking of First Ladies, I'm Jill's husband. Jill wanted to be here tonight. But if you turn on your -- if you turn on the Olympics and watch Team USA, you'll see Jill Biden standing there, cheering with them. (Applause.)
The Japanese Prime Minister, who was -- I invited him to be the first person to come to the White House -- head of state -- he made it real clear: He didn't want me, he wanted her to go. (Laughter.) He is a man of incredible judgment.
Look, folks, now, of course, it's great to be with my friend and your once and future governor, Terry McAuliffe. (Applause.)
I mean this -- think about this --
AUDIENCE: Terry! Terry! Terry!
THE PRESIDENT: You got it. You're not going to find anyone -- I mean anyone -- who knows how to get more done for Virginia than Terry. That's a fact. You don't have to wonder what kind of governor Terry will be; you know what kind of governor he was and what kind of governor he'll be again.
He was a great governor of Virginia, and he'll be even greater this time because he even has more going for him. And, Virginia, you got to elect him again. (Applause.) You got to elect him again.
And I mean this: not just for Virginia, but for the country. The country is looking. These off-year elections, the country is looking. This is a big deal.
Terry and I share a lot in common. I ran against Donald Trump, and so is Terry. (Laughter and applause.) And I whipped Donald Trump in Virginia and so will Terry. (Applause.)
I tell you what, the guy Terry is running against is an acolyte of Donald Trump, for real. I mean, it's just like -- I don't know where these guys come from. (Laughter.) I really mean it.
But above all, Terry and I -- Terry, we share the same vision about delivering results and, maybe most importantly, why we got involved in politics in the first place. The very wealthy -- and I respect anybody who makes a lot of money; you should be able to be a millionaire or billionaire, whatever you want, as long as you pay your fair share. But here's the deal -- (applause) -- they don't need me to protect them.
I got involved in politics because the neighborhood I came from, the towns I came from -- Scranton and Claymont, Delaware -- little steel town -- delivering results for hardworking people, who, if you just give them a chance -- (applause) -- just a chance, they never, never let the country down. (Applause.)
You know -- I really mean that. That's not -- that's not hyperbole. I really mean it. Just, look -- I've been in office now for six months, as of a couple days ago. (Applause.) And I think -- I think the administration has a lot to be proud of.
We've vaccinated over 160 million Americans. (Applause.) We've created over three million new jobs -- more than any administration has in the first six months in entire presidential history. (Applause.) Never has it happened before.
We eliminated -- what we're on -- we're now estimated to be on track -- the economy, not growing before the recession, before COVID, said the economy would grow -- it would be three, three and a half percent. Now everything from the OECD to all Wall Street suggests that we're going to grow this economy 7 percent just this year. (Applause.) That is the highest growth in more than four decades in America. In fact, it's the best job growth in the world right now. (Applause.)
And in just the past few weeks, one of the biggest tax cuts in the history for families in American with kids went into effect this last week. (Applause.)
I've been saying -- I really mean this -- it's about time ordinary, hardworking people get a tax break. (Applause.) Because that's what it is. Parents should see that money going into their bank accounts right now. And let me tell you what it's going to mean for Americans: We're going to cut child poverty in half this year because of that. (Applause.)
Look, Terry and I share the same basic truth: Trickle-down economies never work. It's time to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. That's where we are. (Applause.)
And, by the way, the wealthy have never done poorly when the middle-class and the working-class people do well -- they do well.
Look, Terry understands that it started with the American Rescue Plan that's delivering immediate relief to the folks who needed it most -- folks who were on the back of their -- on heels, a lot of them knocked down.
Those rescue checks that went out to more than 80 percent of the adults and children in Virginia that provide a little extra breathing room for people.
My dad used to say -- I really mean this -- my dad used to say, ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about just having, Joey…"" -- and I mean this sincerely. When he left -- lost everything in Scranton and we moved to Delaware, he said, ""Joey, it's about a little breathing room. That's all people are asking for -- just a little bit of breathing room, a little extra room.""
Look, aid for small businesses that helps them hire and reopen there doors. I'm looking -- here it is. Excuse me. (Applause.)
Aid to cities and counties to keep their police officers and firefighters and first responders on the job, educators on the job. (Applause.)
The American Rescue Plan lowered health insurance premiums for those buying into the Affordable Care Act by 40 percent on average, saving people $600 a year. (Applause.)
And Terry knows the work continues -- that healthcare should be right, just not a privilege, folks. (Applause.)
And as I said when I was running, with Terry and Dorothy's help, it's not enough to build back. I mean this sincerely. America is the only nation in the world, when it's faced a crisis, has come back stronger than before the crisis -- the only one. I'm not joking.
We have to build back and build back better. It's amazing how that phrase has caught on around the world, isn't it? (Applause.)
But Terry and I know, along with Mark Warner and Tim Kaine and Don Beyer and Abby Spanberger -- (applause) -- who are working on this in Congress. It means modernizing our physical infrastructure.
Folks, we used to invest more than any country in the world in research and development. We had the number-one infrastructure in the world -- the best roads, highways, airports, ports.
Infrastructure is about rebuilding roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes that are poisoning our kids and the water system; delivering high-speed Internet to every single Virginian, rural and urban -- (applause); making sure ""Buy American"" -- so when we invest in the jobs, when we purchase all this, that American workers are doing the work.
It's not that complicated. It really isn't if you fight for it.
Terry and I share the belief that building back better means investing also in our human infrastructure. You know, that's my plan. It includes all the things Terry is fighting for. Terry and I believe that when we educate our children earlier, they do better. They do better. (Applause.) No matter what -- no matter what background they come from, all the studies at the great universities in this state and others have -- in the last eight years -- have pointed out that if a kid goes to -- not daycare, but preschool, beginning at age three, they increase, by 58 percent, the possibility of going all the way through school and on to community college. (Applause.)
That's why we support universal pre-K for three- and four-year-olds. (Applause.) And, Terry, if I get it done, you all aren't going to have to pay for it here in Virginia.
And, look, we believe 12 years of education is not enough to compete in the 21st century economy. That's why I want to make two-year community college available to every single American. (Applause.) We can afford to do this.
I do have one concern. My wife Jill is teaching fulltime still as a community college professor and First Lady. (Applause.) But Terry is going to be her boss again. (Laughter.) Because she teaches at Vir- -- anyway -- Northern Virginia Community College. (Laughter.)
And, by the way, Terry, since the time she started working there, she's never stopped teaching. When we got elected, she thought that she was going to continue to teach. She thought I might object. I strongly supported it. (Applause.) Teaching is not what my wife does; it's who she is.
And, folks, look -- look, the fact is that the idea that we are able to bring together people to give them great opportunities is totally within -- you know, look -- and we can afford to do this. We can afford to do this. If the very wealthy just start paying their fair share just a little bit. (Applause.)
Terry and I know -- (applause) -- how hard the pandemic has been on working families, especially women. About 2 million women are still unable to go back into the workforce during this pandemic due to things like not being able to afford childcare.
Look, when I got elected to the United States Senate, I was 29 years old. Between the time I got elected and before I was sworn in, there was an automobile accident. My wife and daughter were killed and my two boys almost died. And, by the way, I thank all firefighters. It took the Jaws of Life three hours to get them out on top of their dead mom and dead sister. You saved their lives.
And I needed help. I was a senator making $42,000 a year. I could no longer afford daycare and someone to take care of my kids (inaudible). And thank God I had a sister who is my friend, who -- she and her husband, without my asking, moved in and helped me raise my kids. My mom and my brother as well. I got lucky.
But, look, the idea, as a single mom or a single dad, working and having young children -- it's awful hard. That's why Terry and I want to expand paid leave and childcare in this country. (Applause.)
And, by the way, Terry, you and I have been talking about this for a long time. We've been talking about high drug prices -- how incredibly high they are and how we keep getting ripped off. You know, we pay more for our drugs than any major country in the world.
But here's the deal. There's a way to do it: Let Medicare negotiate drug prices. (Applause.) And guess what? All of the prices are going to come down. And it will pay for itself. I promise you, I'm going to get that done. (Applause.)
Look -- and here's the deal, Terry and I know this can be paid for. Look, we support asking the wealthiest 1 percent who got that $2 trillion tax cut that, in fact -- in fact, not a single penny was paid for -- the so-called ""Trump tax cut.""
And guess what? Just pay. Begin to pay their fair share. Corporate America -- I come from the corporate capital of the world. More corporations are, in fact, registered in Delaware than every other state in the union combined. I got elected 36 years there because I was honest with them.
Look, fift- -- right today, 50 of the biggest corporations in America of the Fortune 500 -- 50 of them don't pay -- and this is not an exaggeration; check it out -- not a single solitary penny in federal taxes. Not one. And they made over 40 --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE PRESIDENT: No, but -- no, but I'm not doing this to get -- I just want to make it clear to you. (Laughter.)
Here's the deal: They made over $40 billion. If they just paid a minimum tax of 15 percent, they'd raise the dollars -- all we need to do all this education we're talking about here.
Look, you know -- (applause) -- when I was Vice President, the President asked me to check out what the major corporations needed the most. Along with the Secretary of Commerce, we interviewed three hundred and, I think it was, fifty-six -- it could have been forty-six -- but over three hundred and fifty CEOs and major corporations.
You know what they all said? ""I need a better-educated workforce."" Well, guess what? They're not spending any money to educate the workforce.
But if we want to make sure America succeeds and runs the world again -- economically runs and -- be the most powerful economy in the world, we should make sure that they have a chance.
These millionaires and billionaires -- I'm not one of these guys that say you shouldn't be able to be a millionaire or billionaire. But just pay your fair share. (Applause.)
Look, all told, experts in the World Bank -- outfits like Wall Street like Moody's estimate that my plan will grow the economy and create $2 million more jobs over the $16 million they said in 10 years we'd create -- good-paying jobs. Good-paying jobs. (Applause.)
A significant amount of these jobs will pay the prevailing wage of 30, 40, 50 bucks an hour. Ninety percent of the jobs in our infrastructure plan go to people without a college degree.
Folks, we're proposing a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America -- a once-in-a-generation investment in American jobs and families that's going to position us to win the competition for the 21st century.
But we've got to get it done. And I need a partner like Terry who not only is respected in this state, but is respected by governors all across America, who knows how to get it done in the states.
Folks, on his watch as governor the last time, the Virginia economy boomed. Two hundred million -- 200,000 jobs created. Unemployment went down in every single county, including rural Virginia, by nearly 50 percent.
He attracted major companies to this state. Look how your state grew. And by the way, any of you who are in the business know the first thing you try to attract a company to come to your city, your state, your town -- the first thing they ask is, ""What's the highway system? Will I have access to interstate? Is the port available? Tell me whether or not I have broadband. Tell me whether or not…"" All the things. All the things we're going to build.
You know, look, Terry worked with Republicans to invest in education, transportation, and workforce development. And, by the way, Virginia has a whole bunch of veterans and active-duty military members -- more than almost any state. (Applause.)
And guess what? The American Rescue Plan marked one of the biggest investments in veterans' health in a long, long time. (Applause.) It will upgrade VA hospitals that are 50 years old, reduce the shortages of doctors and nurses.
No veteran -- from my son who passed away on -- should pick up a phone and say, or have a wife or husband call and say, ""I need help,"" and say, ""We can't see you for a while."" We owe them immediate action. (Applause.) Immediate. It's a sacred obligation.
And I know no governor who stood up for our veterans and military families more than this guy, helping them apply their skills to good-paying civilian jobs -- fields like cybersecurity and healthcare.
He also worked with the General Assembly to fund two new veteran care centers, including the first one in Hampton Roads region, which is hard to believe.
Terry understands. He knows -- he knows also about crime prevention as a top priority.
He understands how important it is funding -- to find funding -- from the American Rescue Plan to provide law enforcement personnel with more resources, not fewer resources. (Applause.)
Look, we need to help in a lot of ways. We need to do away with chokeholds and all those things. I agree, but (inaudible) side of this is we need them to have more social workers, more veterans, more psychological help, more psychologists. (Applause.) And where it happens, it works. Personnel and resources, they keep communities safe.
And he has taken on the gun lobby to enact sensible gun safety measures without infringing on anybody's Second Amendment right, including keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. (Applause.)
Here's what else: Terry is going to guarantee he's going to move to get a $15 minimum wage. Think about it, folks. Just think about it. And you -- maybe some of you, maybe you know people.
Anybody working 40 hours a week making less than $15 an hour is, in fact, living in poverty as defined by poverty in America. It should not happen, period. Period. (Applause.)
An amazing number of American people who are struggling have rental costs and housing costs that are at least 30 to 35 percent of their total income. How do you do that? How do you make it, especially if you have a child? Look, folks, housing that's affordable -- everybody is going to be in the plan.
And, like me, when Terry thinks about the climate crisis, he thinks three things: jobs, jobs, jobs. (Applause.) It is the reason why we're going to lead the world.
Let me close with this -- and I'm sorry, I'm getting kind of wrapped up in this. (Laughter.) I need him. I need him. Look, in this election and in 2022, the question the American people are going to be asking is whether or not we're helping them and their families -- not giving them anything. Are we giving them a shot -- just giving them an even shot? Do we understand what they're going through? Can we deliver for them?
As Democrats, we have to show we do understand, and we're delivering for them, and we're keeping our promises. We just have to keep making the case -- just as the Republican Party today offers nothing but fear, lies, and broken promises. (Applause.)
No, listen -- I mean, think about it -- turning on the television every day and seeing a replay of what happened on January 6th and saying, ""I was told there were a lot of peaceful, wonderful people.""
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE PRESIDENT: God -- no, I really mean it. Think about it. It is bizarre.
We have to keep cutting through the Republican fog that government is the problem and show that ""We the People"" are the solution. (Applause.) We're the most unique country -- think about this -- we're the most unique country in the history of the world. Not a joke. Every other country is put together based on race, religion, ethnicity, background, except the United States.
The United States is based on -- the only country in the world based on the proposition that ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women and men are created equal. Endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights."" Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. We've never met the test, but we've never walked away from it like the Republicans have. (Applause.)
We have never walked away. And we keep -- every administration, we keep moving that needle further and further.
Look, folks, we're going to have to go out and win -- win this thing, win races up and down the ticket. We got to protect your majority in the House of Delegates. (Applause) We got to re-elect Mark as Attorney General. (Applause.) We got to re-elect Hala as your Lieutenant Governor. (Applause.)
We got to elect Terry back as Governor. (Applause.) He's been here before. He knows what to do to. He knows how to get things done.
Virginia, we did it in 2020. In the battle for the soul of America, the people voted. (Applause.) Democracy prevailed. The Constitution held. We have to do this again. (Applause.)
I've said, time and again, no matter what, you can never stop the American people from voting. And they're trying like hell. We have to decide. The power must always be with the people. (Applause.)
Fifty -- I promise you this -- fifty years from now -- fifty years from now, our children and grandchildren will look back and know that it was at this moment America won the 21st century again. (Applause.)
And it starts now. Virginia, it starts with Terry. It starts with you. (Applause.)
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)",NA,"Joseph R.

22-Jul-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Business and Labor Leaders and an Exchange with Reporters,"THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm delighted you're all here. I'm meeting with a group of labor and business leaders who -- and this is one of those meetings I've been looking forward to.
They're not here to negotiate with one another. The good news is they've been here negotiating -- not negotiating -- supporting what we're trying to get done on the infrastructure bill.
And I know that we're looking for this bipartisan effort to get this infrastructure bill passed. As you all know, and they share my belief that it's both in the interest of business and labor to get this done.
And -- and it's about -- not about energy versus environment, it's not about business versus labor; it's all about, basically, a race to the future.
I've been traveling the world lately and -- back out where I used to spend a lot of time, in the G7 and meeting with the summits with the Russians, as well as NATO. And I tell you, the rest of the world is looking to see whether we can get something done. I'm not joking about that.
The single-biggest issue -- I know you've travelled the world, all of you -- and the fact is that they're trying to figure out whether we're so divided that we can't get something done. And -- but I'm convinced that they're convinced now that we have an opportunity to make some real fundamental changes that generate growth in the future.
You know, the days used to be that we were in a position where the United States invested more money in research and development three, four decades ago than any nation in the world. Now we're number eight. And it used to be that China was -- was number nine, and now they're number two.
This is about a race for the 21st century. And you know -- and what we're doing here is, in this race for the future, it's about connecting Americans -- all Americans, rural and urban -- to high-speed Internet, repairing our roads and our bridges so that we can, in fact, no longer be ranked number 9 or 10 in terms of infrastructure in America. Back to what we used to be -- we used to lead the world.
You know, electrify our school buses and our transit systems. And we're going to build national charging networks for electric vehicles; eliminate the nation's lead service pipes. We got 400,000 home- --
I mean, there's just a whole lot we can do that's going to put a lot of people to work. And it's going to improve the life of a lot of people.
We're going to update our power grid -- which, as you saw what happened to Texas last year, there's a lot we can do. It's going to generate -- and, Lonnie, your (inaudible) is going be awful busy, and --
MR. STEPHENSON: We're ready.
THE PRESIDENT: And we're going -- we have to win the comp- -- we really do. This is not hyperbole. We have to win the competition for the 21st century. That's really what's at stake, and I think you all know that. And that's what the Bipartisan Infrastructure does, in my view.
I want to thank everyone here for supporting it. We're going to get into the details, among all of us, about what we think about what needs to be improved, what can be made better or worse. You know, so, we want everybody to be engaged.
So, thank you all, folks, for being here. We're going to now get down to business.
Q: Mr. President, what conversations have you had with public health officials about possibly changing the mask mandate for vaccinated Americans?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'll respond to the COVID question quickly.
We follow the science. What's happening now is all the major scientific operations in this country and the 25-person group we put together are looking at all the possibilities of what's happening now.
We have a pandemic among the nonvaccinated -- those who are not vaccinated.
If you are vaccinated, you are safe. If you are vaccinated, you have over a 98 percent chance of never catching the virus at all. And if you catch it, you're likely to -- overwhelming proof, so far, is you're not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be sick, you're going to probably have no signs that you had it, and you are not going to die. It's a simple proposition.
And what they're doing is they're going into -- investigating every aspect of any change that could or might take place.
But the vaccines are good against all of the variants that are out there, including the Delta variant.
Thank you so much for being here.",NA,"Joseph R. Biden, Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Business and Labor Leaders and an Exchange with Reporters Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/336981 ",,,,,,,,,,,
22-Jul-21,Remarks on Signing the VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act of 2021,"(""Hail to the Chief"" is played.)
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Every time I hear that, I wonder when he's coming. (Laughter.) Please, everybody sit down. Thank you.
Let me begin by doing something no speaker should ever do -- by apologizing. I got a little tied up in that other office I work in, Pat, and I apologize for keeping you waiting because I know you're all as equally busy as I am. And I want to thank you.
Today, I think is a day of hope. And I mean that. A day of hope and healing for victims or crime and organizations that support those victims of crime.
And I want to thank the Vice President and the Second Gentleman, Senators Durbin -- I think he's here; I thought I saw him. Senators Durbin and Baldwin and Grassley and Graham and Murkowski. Representatives Nadler and Fitzpatrick and Jackson-Lee and Wagner and Scanlon. And everyone who has helped make possible this moment, including so many of you who are here today that I haven't mentioned.
When someone commits a crime, it's -- it's not enough to bring the predator to justice; we also need to support the victims. And it's something that, way back -- 150 years ago, when I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we spent a lot of time working on and setting up victims' funds. That's what this Crime Victims Fund does.
In many years of working on the issue, I've visited an awful lot of domestic violence shelters. Every time I'd go into a city, I would quietly -- before I went to where I was supposed to be -- quietly slip in and spend time in a domestic violence shelter to speak to the people giving the services of people getting the services.
And, you know, many times, the body language that you'd see when you walked in was one of the victims of crime finding themselves almost curled up, Dianne, in a ball. They were still suffering from a serious, serious -- not only physical abuse they received, but, quite frankly, the emotional abuse. And you can see the pain. You can see the pain was still with them, and you wondered when was this going to abate, no matter what we did.
According to the CDC -- and I'm -- I think Senator Feinstein remembers -- I got in trouble because when I was pushing the legislation, way back in those days, I said, ""I'm convinced that women who are victims of domestic violence suffer from post-traumatic stress no different than a solider being shot at regularly."" You come home and every time your significant other would come home, if dinner wasn't ready, they smashed your head against the wall. There's no -- there's no difference than being shot at.
And the CDFE [sic] -- the CDC, two years later, came out and said, ""Survivors can experience mental health problems and such depression and the symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome."" Even before research confirmed it, you could see it.
And there are economic costs for survivors as well --medical costs, lost productivity from work, and navigating the court system. That's why Victims Compensation Program helps victims and their families cover the costs they'd suffered from the crime. They can -- there can be counseling and medical bills; lost wages because you couldn't work; paying for temporary housing for a family fleeing abuse; even fixing a broken door kicked down by an abuser. And, you know, the vast majority of children out in the street are the children who are, in fact, the children of abused women. It can also be a long-term support survivors need to heal, every time, in every single sense of the word.
In 2019, these victim compensation funds went directly to over 230,000 victims -- 230,000. These funds also got to states, territories, and Tribes to support thousands of victim services organizations. These organizations have provided services and support to over 13 million survivors.
And, by the way, last night, some of you heard me talk about the need for more policing that understands the need for communities and citizens. These funds will also go to law enforcement agencies to support training on how to respond to victims who have experienced trauma.
In 1984, I was proud to support the -- the passage of the Victims of Crime Act, and created -- that created this fund. I'm also proud to sign the law that significantly strengthened it today. This fund doesn't take a dime of taxpayers' money; it uses fines and penalties paid by convicted federal criminals. However, fines from what are called ""non-prosecutorial agreements"" or defendant -- or ""deferred prosecution agreements"" did not go into this Victims Crimes Fund in the past.
Since there's been more and more of these agreements in recent years, the fund is being depleted. That meant dramatic cuts in the funding it could provide for victims and for organizations to support these victims.
Between 2017 and today, the amount of money in these funds has gone down 92 percent, which has resulted in a 70 percent reduction in victims assistance programs and grants. This means that, for a lot of victims, the help they need isn't there any longer.
When my son Beau was the Attorney General of the state of Delaware, he took pride in getting more support more quickly to victims, especially to protect and care for child victims.
And I know that, as the San Francisco DA and the California Attorney General, Vice President Harris expanded support for victims of crime and launched one of the nation's first medical centers focused on treating childhood trauma caused by violence in a home or in a community.
This bill is going to allow us to make -- make sure that all the fines and penalties that are from federal cases go into the victims -- the Crime Victims Fund to rebuild this fund, because it's badly needed.
This is going to enable us to provide more help and support to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, trafficking, and other crimes all across America.
In order to provide more access and safety and services for victims of gender-based violence, it's long past time to re- -- reauthorize and strengthen the protections through the Violence Against Women Act. Please. Please. You know, you can -- (applause).
You know from experience you all can come together in a bipartisan, bicameral way and to pass this bill. We need to do the same thing to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act without further delay.
You know, after these changes in the Victims Crime Act passed this week, a leader from one of the state's -- state's Coalition Against Domestic Violence sent a letter to her national organization. And she wrote about working in the shelter where their ability to serve people rose and fell based on the fundings of victim services. She told the story of a client she lost to domestic violence homicide because the budget cuts left them without space at the shelter or staff needed to help this particular woman.
Upon learning about the law I'm about to sign today, she wrote, and I quote -- I quote, ""I think about her every day. This is going to be truly lifesaving,"" end of quote. This is what you've done -- truly lifesaving.
In closing, I want to thank those angels working on the frontlines to help these victims, especially during this pandemic that's made the work both more difficult, more in demand, and more dangerous. And I want to thank the advocates who mobilized and bring together these important changes in the law.
There are thousands of people out there who may not know about the work you did to get this bill passed, but they'll know that they are getting the help they need to put their lives back together and move toward healing and toward justice. I will now have the great honor of signing the bill. And I'd invite the sponsors to come on up and stand with me if you're willing. (Applause.)
(The act is signed.)
This is one of those deals where what they did is literally, not figuratively, going to change the lives of women and children and some men out there. So, thank you. (Applause.)",NA,"Joseph R.

21-Jul-21,"Remarks in an Exchange with Reporters Prior to Departure from Cincinnati Airport in Hebron, Kentucky","THE PRESIDENT: I can't see you, but I know you're there. Thank you for your patience today. I know it's a long day for you. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I was just talking to one of the people who asked the question (inaudible).
Q: Mr. President, the debt limit: Mitch McConnell said today that Republicans won't vote to raise the debt limit, and Democrats will have to include it in reconciliation. What's your response?
THE PRESIDENT: I was hoping that wouldn't be the case. You know, for the last four years, they've just extended the debt limit. The reason for the significant debt is because of their -- their debt, their tax limit -- excuse me, their tax cut.
And there are going to be a couple of very difficult decisions that are going to have to be made to get through the end of the year. And one of them is the debt limit and extending the debt.
So, I don't have an answer for you, but it's -- I hope we can get by it.
Q: Mr. President, what do you think of the Republicans and Fox News changing their tune on the vaccine?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, rather than be critical of it, I thank them for it. I think it's a matter of -- first of all, in truth, I don't know how many of them believed what they were saying. They may have really believed it -- the things that they've been saying.
And -- but I think once the realization occurred that this virus is only killing primarily those people who had not been vaccinated, I think it was sort of, as we Catholics say, a bit of an ""epiphany"" for them. You know, it was a -- like a -- you know, conversion on the way to Damascus or something.
But I think it became real, and I -- I'm glad they had the courage to say what they said. And hopefully it will have some impact.
Q: Any comment on the Nord Stream deal, sir? The fact that there's a deal that Nord Stream 2 is going to move forward.
THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I can. Nord Stream is 99 percent finished. The idea that anything that was going to be said or done was going to stop it was not possible.
But I had, as you know, very, very fruitful discussions with Angela Merkel, and her -- she is working with the German government on a commitment that suggests that if, in fact, Russia takes pains to deliberately inflict pain on Ukraine or other countries, they will respond.
Q: Mr. President, what do you say to Americans who have done everything right? They've gotten fully vaccinated and they still contract COVID -- a ""breakthrough case,"" as it's called. What do say to them?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I say to them: There are very, very, very, very, very, very few people -- number one. Those that it happened to, I don't -- it may be possible -- I know of none where they're hospitalized, in ICU, and/or passed away.
So, at a minimum, I can say that even if they did contract it -- which I'm sorry they did -- it's such a tiny percentage, and it is not life-threatening.
Guys, we got to get on the plane or they're going to leave us all. Thank you.
Q: Mr. President, one more question on January 6th.
THE PRESIDENT: January 6th is -- look, guys.
Q: Are you concerned that no matter what happens now, the result is going to be perceived as partisan?
THE PRESIDENT: No, because I think the American public, as I said tonight -- you can't not understand what happened and still be partisan and try to cover it up. But nobody really believes it wasn't an insurrection. I mean, you know it. You can see it on the looks on their faces. They know it.

21-Jul-21,"Remarks in a CNN Town Hall with Don Lemon at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, Ohio","THE PRESIDENT: How you doing, pal? Good to see you.
MR. LEMON: Good to see you.
THE PRESIDENT: Good to see you.
MR. LEMON: How you been?
THE PRESIDENT: Well. (Applause.) Thank you. (Laughter.)
MR. LEMON: It's good to see you.
THE PRESIDENT: It's good to be back.
MR. LEMON: Yeah, you as well.
So, listen, I'm going to get to the audience. And I know you don't want to sit down, right?
THE PRESIDENT: No.
MR. LEMON: You'd rather stand here and talk to these guys.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm going to go out in the audience. (Laughs.)
MR. LEMON: We're going to get to the audience questions in just a moment. But I have a couple questions I want to ask you.
THE PRESIDENT: Sure.
MR. LEMON: Because you know the pandemic is a big concern for everyone, really, around the world --
THE PRESIDENT: Sure is.
MR. LEMON: -- especially around America. New cases are up three -- you know, three times since last month. Right? The pandemic is a big concern. Hospitalizations, death rising.
So, you said last month that this -- that the virus is in retreat. Do you still feel that way? Is that still the case?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, the virus -- look, here's the -- it's real simple: We have a pandemic for those who haven't gotten a vaccination. It's that basic, that simple. Ten thousand people have recently died; 9,950 of them, thereabouts, are people who hadn't been vaccinated.
There's a simple, basic proposition: If you're vaccinated, you're not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be in an ICU unit, and you're not going to die.
So it's gigantically important that you act like -- we all act like Americans that care about our -- our fellow Americans. To get -- there's legitimate questions people can ask -- that they worry about getting vaccinated -- but the questions should be asked, answered, and people should get vaccinated.
But this is not a pandemic. We've made sure that since I got in office, we -- we've inoculated over 160 million people; 85 percent of people over the age of 50. (Applause.) Anyway.
It's frustrating.
MR. LEMON: But what do you say to people who are worried about a new round of restrictions and mask mandates and so forth?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm saying -- look -- (laughs) -- it's a little bit like when I got elected. You know, the -- this pandemic was out of control. You know, we've lost more people in the United States -- over 630-some-thousand people than in every major war we've ever fought, in the United States of America. And that's come to a screeching halt for those who've been vaccinated. It really has. Not a joke. This is overwhelming evidence to sustain that.
And so, what I say to people who are worried about a new pandemic is: Get vaccinated. If you're vaccinated, even if you do catch the ""virus,"" quote, unquote -- like people talk about it in normal terms -- you're in overwhelm- -- not many people do. If you do, you're not likely to get sick. You're probably going to be symptomless. You're not going to be in a position where you -- where your life is in danger.
So, it's really, kind of, basic.
Q: Well, let's get to the questions, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay.
Q: Okay. I want to introduce you to Andrea Granieri. She's a community resource director for a charter school. She's a Democrat currently running for her local school board.
Andrea, welcome.
THE PRESIDENT: God love you. The most important, thankless job in the world: being on a school board.
Q: Thank you. So, here in Hamilton County, the vaccination rate remains at about 50 percent -- and you talked about the virus that's spreading. Masks are seen less and less. And, as you know, children under age 12 still are not eligible to be vaccinated. Schools are working with all of this information as they think about reopening next month. As a school employee and as a parent to children under age 12, what -- I'm really concerned. What is your message to those parents, educators, and school districts?
THE PRESIDENT: I understand your concern. I really do. My children are grown now, but my grandchildren -- and I have one who's only one-and-a-half years old. So, you know, I understand -- number one.
My message is that one of the reasons why -- you remember the criticism I got initially, saying, ""Teachers should get vaccination, get in line first."" The vast majority of teachers are vaccinated, number one.
Number two, the CDC is going to say that what we should do is, everyone over the age of -- under the age of 12 should probably be wearing a mask in school. That's probably what's going to happen.
Secondly, those over the age of 12 who are able to get vaccinated -- if you're vaccinated, you shouldn't wear a mask. If you aren't vaccinated, you should be wearing a mask.
So it's going to get a little bit tight in terms of, ""Well, are mom or dad being honest that, you know, Johnny did or did not get vaccinated?"" That's going to raise questions. But I think what's going to happen is you're going to see this work out in ways that people are going to know in the community. Everybody knows in the community whether or not Johnny really did get the vaccination when he's 15 or 17 years old.
And so it's going to -- I think it's -- it's a matter of community responsibility, and I think you're going to see it work through.
MR. LEMON: Well, let me ask -- let me follow up on her question, asking: When will children under 12 be able to get vaccinated?
THE PRESIDENT: Soon, I believe. Now, look, one of the things that I committed to do when I got elected -- I said --
MR. LEMON: How soon is ""soon,"" Mr. President? Not to --
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I -- and let me he- -- let me finish the question -- the answer. ""Soon"" in the sense that I do not tell any scientists what they should do. I do not interfere. (Applause.)
And so they are doing -- they are doing the examinations now -- the testing now, and making the decision now. When they are ready, when they've done all the scientific need to be done to determine children at ages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, they, in fact, are -- all have different makeups. They're developing. They're trying to figure out whether or not there's a vaccination that would affect one child that's at such and such an age and not another child. That's underway.
Just like the other question, there's a logical -- and I've heard you speak about it because you always -- I'm not being solicitous, but you -- you're always straight up about what you're doing.
And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are -- why can't the -- the -- the experts say, ""We know that this virus is, in fact -- it's going to be…"" -- or, excuse me -- ""We know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved."" That's underway too. I expect that to occur quickly.
MR. LEMON: Well, that means -- you mean for the FDA?
THE PRESIDENT: For the FDA.
MR. LEMON: Yeah. So, what do you --
THE PRESIDENT: The Federal Drug Administration.
MR. LEMON: You said that you're talking to scientists, though, but what -- what are they telling you, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: What they're telling me is, ""Let us decide, based on scientific data, in how we proceed. Do it the way we would ordinarily do it.""
Look, for example, everybody talks about how, you know, this virus came -- this -- this -- the drugs that are designed to kill the virus came along so quickly. They've been working on it for two decades. There's nothing quick about this. It's been over two decades.
So people said, ""I'm not taking a drug that was approved so quickly."" It's been two decades. The truth is we haven't said it enough to people to allay their feals [sic]. There's nothing -- their fears. This is nothing that just happened yesterday and they said, ""Well, let's take a shot on this."" And there's a process. Usually the process takes the better part of a year or more to get some of these things decided.
But the expectation -- they're not promising me any specific date -- but my expectation, talking to the group of scientists we put together -- over 20 of them, plus others in the field -- is that sometime maybe in the beginning of the school year -- at the end of August, beginning of September, October -- they'll get a final approval saying the FDA said, ""No, this is it. It's good.""
But again, one last thing. I -- we don't talk enough to you about this, I don't think. One last thing that's really important is: We're not in a position where we think that any virus -- including the Delta virus, which is much more transmissible and more deadly in terms of non -- unvaccinated people -- the vi- -- the various shots that people are getting now cover that. They're -- you're okay. You're not going to -- you're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
MR. LEMON: Yeah. I want to stay on the subject. I want to get to Dr. Nicole Baldwin. She's a pediatrician and a Republican.
Dr. Baldwin, go ahead.
THE PRESIDENT: Doc, how are you?
Q: Hi. Thank you for taking my question, Mr. President. I am a pediatrician who utilizes social media to educate about health. And I'm very concerned about the rise in misinformation from the anti-vaccine community that is eroding trust in lifesaving vaccines. Spread of this misinformation and declining vaccination rates could leave Americans vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases in the future.
So, what I want to know is: What is the White House doing to combat medical misinformation and to restore America's faith in science?
THE PRESIDENT: What we're doing is, number one, to restore America's faith in science is listen to the scientists. (Applause begins.) No, I'm not joking. (Applause.) I mean, literally listen to the scientists, and not interfere, not rush anything. Just make -- let the scientists proceed, because they desperately want to get this right -- number one.
Number two, you may have heard -- I never get myself in trouble, as you know, politically -- (laughs) -- but you may have heard that I was critical of some of the things that are on Facebook, and it was that I was attacking Facebook. I wasn't attacking Facebook. There was a report out saying that for that -- something like 45 percent of the overwhelming disinformation on Facebook comes from 12 individuals. I said: They're killing people -- those 12 individuals; that misinformation is going to kill people. Not a joke. Not a joke.
It's like telling your kid, ""I tell you what…"" -- four years old -- ""…when you see a red light, cross the street."" I mean, come on.
And so, what we're trying to do is use every avenue we can -- public, private, government, non-government -- to try to get the facts out, what they really are. And one of the things, Doc, that's happening, that I'm feeling better about -- I'm not being a wise guy now. You know, you -- one of those other networks is not a big fan of mine. (Laughter.) One you talk about a lot.
But if you noticed, as they say in that southern part of my state, ""They've had an altar call,"" some of those guys. (Laughter.) All of a sudden, they're out there saying, ""Let's get vaccinated. Let's get vaccinated."" The very people who before this were saying --
So that -- but that -- I shouldn't make fun. That's good. It's good. It's good. We just have to keep telling the truth. That's why -- for example, my wife just flew to Alaska today to do an event in Alaska about making sure people understand and get vaccinated, talking about COVID, et cetera.
So it's -- you know. And, by the way, there's pockets. If you notice, there's about -- what? -- four or five states that have close to 45 percent or whatever. Don't hold me to the exact number.
MR. LEMON: Lower than that, even. In my home state of Louisiana, it's 36 percent, and I think there are other southern states.
THE PRESIDENT: No, but I mean, out of all the cases --
MR. LEMON: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: -- all the cases, a very overwhelming majority of those cases are in four or five states. And it's just not -- there's nothing political about this. There's no blue or red. (Applause.)
MR. LEMON: Well, let's bring in Christian Oliver. He's a Democrat. He works for the insurance industry.
Christian, what's your question?
Q: Well, so, my wife Stephanie and I are newlyweds, as of this past Saturday.
THE PRESIDENT: I'd brag if I were you too. (Applause.)
As they say when they look at me and my wife: ""You married up, kid."" (Laughter.)
Q: (Laughs.) Thank you.
We require all of our guests and vendors to be vaccinated to ensure safety. We are African American, and in many of our communities, people are against the vaccine. A reason that stood out the most in regards to our guests is that they don't see the vaccine as being as safe as the CDC put it -- puts it out to be. How are you working toward convincing those in these communities that the vaccine is safe?
THE PRESIDENT: It's really an important question because, in the African American community, there is less of an uptake of the vaccination. Number one, there's a reason for that: You know, you go back just to even World War Two. African Americans were used as experimental; they were almost like guinea pigs in terms of ex- -- they were -- anyway.
And your mom and dad remember that, or your grandparents remember that. And so there's a reason for people to think that, ""I don't know, I'm not sure I trust. I'm not sure I trust this."" Plus, a lot of disinformation on top of it.
One of the things that we're doing is what I've done -- ""we've"" done, excuse me -- my team has done -- is we've provided the ability to put in African American communities the vaccine and those who are, in fact, able to administer the vaccine, and people who are respected in the community, in the vacc- -- in those areas, particularly in areas where you have public health commu- -- public health centers, where you, in fact, have people who are the folks who are really at the low end of the economic scale, don't have much access to anything.
So we've taken literally mobile vans and people to the communities, to the hardest-hit communities, and it's beginning to have some impact. But we have to talk about it more.
For example, I was just with -- I get in trouble because my wife is a Philly girl and a Philly fan, an Eagles fan. I just hosted the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And -- and there's a guy -- there's a quarterback there. What's his name, man? (Laughter.)
Anyway, all kidding aside, you know, what we're doing is getting people of consequence, who are respected in the community -- whether they're athletes, whether or not they are entertainers, whether they're just well respected. And, by the way, one of the things I've gotten able to get done: I've get -- I have overwhelming support from the African American clergy that I sort of come from, and my so- -- support. They are opening up their churches for -- as vaccination centers. (Applause.)
MR. LEMON: Can I ask you something, Mr. President? Because, you know -- and, by the way, you got -- I don't know if you heard that you got applause when you corrected the ""I"" for ""we."" And we're talking about ""we,"" and I think that's --
THE PRESIDENT: Well, it is ""we.""
MR. LEMON: -- a commendable attribute to have.
But even with my own family -- I was just able to get with them. I haven't seen my mom in a year and a half, except for two weeks ago. I hadn't seen my family for two years since the last time they visited me two summers ago. But even within my own family -- here I am on television every night -- there is ambivalence, there's misinformation, and there's also mistrust in the system. How do you fix that?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think -- you're going to -- this is going to seem like a non-answer to start with. One of the things I said when I ran for office -- it's not Democrat or Republican again -- is we got to restore faith in government. You got to get people to a point where they trust government.
And I made a commitment that when I made a mistake, I'd tell you I've made mistakes. And when I think I got it right, I'll say it. But I'll take responsibility for what I do and say.
Part of it is just generally -- (applause) -- no, I don't mean that -- part of it is, generally, raising confidence in elected officials. Raising confidence. And I know this is going to sound like a non-answer to you, but part of this is that, you know -- you know because you're one of the most informed journalists in the country. You know the criticism I got when I said I'm going to unite the country. They said, ""You can't unite the country."" Well, if we can't unite the country, we can never get some of these problems solved.
And that goes to trust. Why can't you unite the country? Why isn't there a willingness to trust? Government trust is really at a -- was at an incredibly low ebb. It's coming up some.
So with regard to your family in particular. Part of it is not just that they see you on television and trust you; the people who seem to have the most impact are the -- are, you know, that -- for that 17-year-old kid, the kid that he or she plays ball with. ""You got the vaccination? Are you okay? I mean, you seem…"" ""No, it works."" Or you, you know -- or the mom and dad, or the neighbor, or when you go to church, or when you're -- no, I really mean it.
There are trusted interlocutors. Think of the people -- if your kid wanted to find out whether or not there were -- there's a man on the moon, or whatever -- you know, something, or, you know, whether those aliens are here or not -- you know, who are the people they talk to beyond the kids who love talking about it? They go to people they respect, and they say, ""What do you think?""
And so they should be asking other people -- the people there -- everything from their teachers to their ministers to the priest, to people that they trust.
MR. LEMON: Well, part of it is that -- don't you think part of it is that young people, especially those who are 30 -- maybe 30, 40 and under, they feel like they're invincible; they haven't faced mortality.
THE PRESIDENT: Isn't it amazing we're saying ""40 or younger""? (Laughter.) It's hard to say, isn't it?
MR. LEMON: It is. But for them, you know, at first, the va- -- at first, the virus wasn't affecting them as much.
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
MR. LEMON: And so they may feel that they're invincible. And now that this Delta variant is affecting them, maybe they'll have a ""come to Jesus"" of some sort. I'm --
THE PRESIDENT: Well, by the way, I think that is -- that's happening. And, look, think about this: This is the worst health crisis in 100 years. As I said, more people have died than all our major wars combined. Think about that.
If I told you that or you had told me that two years ago, I'd say, ""Come on. That's not going to happen in America."" But it happened. It happened. And people are unfortunately -- some more slowly than others --
Now, by the way, remember when I first got elected, the issue was, well, I said I was going to do a million shots a week, and people said, ""Biden can't do that"" or ""Biden team can't do that."" And it was 2 million. We had trouble getting enough people -- and people who wanted to get vaccinated. We're opening up stadiums. We're getting 100,000 people coming through.
So, the vast majority of the American people said, ""I understand. I want to get this vaccination."" But now, when the -- when it's phased off, either ""I'm invincible, I'm young, I'm not going to get sick, it won't happen to me"" -- or whatever the reason -- now they're looking around and they're saying, ""Whoa, boy. In the community I live in, there's very few people who have gotten the vaccination. This COVID is much more transmissible; it's really rising. I better get some…""
So, I think it's gradually changing. And you got a great dog there, kid. (Laughter.)
Q: (Inaudible.) (Off-mic.)
MR. LEMON: By the way, that is Danielle Lippi. She's a student here at the university, and she's a Republican. She's got a question for you. Go ahead, Danielle.
Q: Yes. Okay.
THE PRESIDENT: But your dog is a Democrat -- I can tell. (Laughter and applause.) I'm teasing. I'm teasing. I'm a big dog person. I'm sorry.
Q: Her name is Wonder. (Laughs.)
So, my question is: The economy is picking up significantly as it reopens from the pandemic. Are you concerned about the higher inflation prices, especially as we see gasoline, automotive, and food prices increase rapidly? What is your administration doing to help prevent the economy from overheating, such as the poor and middle class are not hurt by the higher prices of goods in the long run?
THE PRESIDENT: First of all, the good news is the economy is picking up significantly. It's rational, when you think about it. The cost of an automobile bill, it's kind of back to what it was before the pandemic. We compare what the prices were for the last year in the pandemic, and they are up. They're up because, in fact, there was not much to call for.
For example, automobiles: You know, you had the rental car companies selling off their entire stock. You found yourself in the same way with automobile dealers. And all of a sudden, now it's coming back, and we're going to grow at 7 percent -- is expected. We created more jobs in the first six months of my -- our administration than any time in American history. No President has ever -- no administration has ever created as many jobs. And all of a sudden, people are saying -- (applause) -- no, I don't say it -- but it goes to the legitimate question being asked about the concern about inflation.
The vast majority of the experts, including Wall Street, are suggesting that it's highly unlikely that it's going to be long-term inflation that's going to get out of hand. There will be near-term inflation because everything is now trying to be picked back up.
And, by the way, that's one of the reasons why I also signed an executive order dealing with the whole idea of competition -- you know, the idea that we're in a situation where there are so many companies who are keeping people out of the competition. For example, you have over 600,000 people out there signing -- 6 million people signing a -- I better check the number -- of -- signing non-compete agreements. Not because they have any sta- -- any secret, but because they were working for one fast food restaurant, and they're told they can't get 10 cents more going across town going to the other fast food restaurant. Why? To keep wages down.
And so what's happening now is, all of a sudden, people are having choices. You know, I always thought the free market system was not only that there's competition among companies, but, guess what? Companies should have to compete for workers. Guess what? Maybe even pay more money. (Applause.)
MR. LEMON: So, you seem pretty confident that inflation is temporary. But if you're pumping all of this money into the economy, couldn't that add to --
THE PRESIDENT: No, look, here's the deal: Moody's, today, went out -- a Wall Street firm, not some liberal think tank -- said if we passed the other two things I'm trying to get done, we will, in fact, reduce inflation. Reduce inflation. Reduce inflation -- because we're going to be providing good opportunities and jobs for people who, in fact, are going to be reinvesting that money back into all the things we're talking about, driving down prices, not raising prices.
And so, it is -- I sincerely mean this: Prices are up now, and they're up in -- for example, you're in a position where you're trying to build a house, trying to find two-by-fours and lumber. Well, guess what? People stopped working cutting lumber. They stopped doing it because they -- the unemployment was so down. Now, all of a sudden, there's this need because people are coming back. And guess what? Instead of paying 10 cents, you're paying 20. But you understand what I'm saying.
MR. LEMON: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: It relates to what, in fact, is now needed because we're growing. I don't know anybody, including Larry Summers -- who's a friend of mine -- who's worried about inflation, is suggesting that there's any long-term march here if we do the things we're going to do.
For example, if we get this build on that I've been -- put together a long time ago -- and, by the way, I want to say, I'm in his territory. You know, there's -- Portman is a good man. Portman is a congressman from this area. I talked to him before I got -- and I really mean it. He's a decent, honorable man, and he and I are working on trying to get this -- this infrastructure bill passed.
MR. LEMON: But you're -- you're talking about Senator Rob Portman of Ohio?
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I'm sorry. I --
MR. LEMON: No, but --
THE PRESIDENT: I thought that (inaudible). I apologize.
MR. LEMON: Yeah, but -- no, since you -- you mention that infrastructure, the bipartisan infrastructure deal failed the procedural vote today. Right?
THE PRESIDENT: But -- no --
MR. LEMON: In the Senate today.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, it did. But that's irrelevant.
MR. LEMON: Go on. Okay.
In the Senate, negotiators say that they need more time.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MR. LEMON: Okay. So, then -- but they're expected to vote again on Monday, but how much time do you think that they need to get this done?
THE PRESIDENT: Until Monday. (Laughter.) Look -- no, I'm not being facetious. I'm not being facetious. You had up to 20 Republicans sign a letter saying, ""We think we need this deal. We think we need this deal."" And so I think there'll be -- by the way, the reason we're talking this way: We need 60 votes to get something moving. And what's going to happen is, I believe -- because I take my Republican colleagues at my -- at their word when you shake. I come from a tradition in the Senate: You shake your hand. That's it. You keep your word.
And I found Rob Portman does that. I found that -- you know, your governor is a good man. You shake his hand, it's done. (Applause.) No, I really mean that. I'm not -- I'm not being falsely complimentary.
MR. LEMON: Do you think it's going to move forward in the Senate on Monday?
THE PRESIDENT: I do. Here's what I think: What happens is, the vote on Monday is a motion to be able to proceed to this issue. Then they're going to debate the issue of the elements -- the individual elements of this plan to sake [sic] sure we're going to fix that damn bridge of yours going into Kentucky. (Applause.) No, I'm serious.
MR. LEMON: We're going to talk about that bridge in just a moment. We asked (inaudible) about that bridge.
THE PRESIDENT: Anyway. But I think it's going to get done.
You may find in the amendments that take place on the detail -- the detail of whether or not -- and I'm the guy that wrote this bill to begin with, and so I've had to compromise to make changes in the bill. When I say ""I,"" I campaigned on this. I mean, everybody thought I was a little nuts when I talked about there are three reasons why I was running: one, to restore the soul of this country and bring back some decency; two, to build back the middle class because they've been getting really knocked around a long time. They're the backbone that unite the country.
And one of the big issues was dealing with infrastructure. Remember, the last four years we had ""Infrastructure Week"" every week. We didn't do a thing. But it's necessary. (Laughter.) No, I really mean it. It's going to not only increase job opportunities, it's going to increase commerce. It's going to -- it's a good thing, and I think we're going to get it done.
MR. LEMON: A lot of this stuff you're going need -- you need bipartisan support. So, let's -- let's talk about that.
Our next question comes from Cindy Peebles. She's a financial executive and a Democrat. Go ahead, Cindy.
Q: Hello, Mr. President. I am dismayed at how often Democratic plans for stabilizing the economy or shoring up new strains of the virus are held hostage by the utopian need to gain bipartisan support. It appears, at every turn, the Democratic plan is weakened and still secures zero Republican votes. Sometimes the opposition is just wrong, and working to get them to agree with you is fruitless. Why is the strategy to abandon the need for bipartisanship not the right answer?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I may be the wrong guy to talk to because I spent a lot of time as a Senator and Vice President, and I'm going to say something outrageous: I don't know you'll find any Republican I've ever worked with who says I ever broke my word, didn't do exactly what I said I would do and keep my word.
And I was able to get an awful lot of compromises put together to do really good things, to change things. And I still believe that's possible.
But the well has been so poisoned over the last four years. And even now, there's still this lingering effort. A lot of my Republican friends -- and I'm not talking about Portman; I'm not talking about your governor -- a lot of my Republican friends say, ""Joe, I -- I know you're right, but if I do this, I'll get primaried and I'll lose my primary. I'll be in trouble.""
But I think that's all beginning to move. I don't mean overnight. Don't get me wrong, I'm not playing out some panacea here. But I think people are figuring out that if we want to -- I've always found you get rewarded for doing what you think at the time is the right thing, and people really believe you believe it's the right thing to do.
MR. LEMON: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: And so I think you're seeing it coming together. And, by the way, the compromises are -- you know, are real -- compromise within my own party between the far left and the center and some of the folks who are more conservative. That's coming together. They said that would never happen, but if you notice, it has happened.
MR. LEMON: Well, let's talk a little bit more about bipartisanship. You know, the Republicans removed all their picks today for the January 6 committee -- the select committee. Nancy Pelosi rejected two of them.
The first thing I want to ask you is, what's your reaction to that? But number two, if Republicans and Democrats can't come together -- right? -- to investigate the biggest attack on our Capitol in 200 years, what makes you think that they can come together on anything?
THE PRESIDENT: These people. (Applause.) No, I mean it. I'm not being facetious. Democrats and Republicans. I don't care if you think I'm Satan reincarnated. (Laughter.) The fact is, you can't look at that television and say, ""Nothing happened on the 6th."" You can't listen to people who say this was a ""peaceful march."" No, I'm serious. Think about it. Think of the things being said.
I've been through the other end of this when the Democrats, 35 years ago, were way off to the other side. Think about it.
MR. LEMON: But what you can do, though -- what they can do is try to change the narrative and say, ""Well, why wasn't Nancy Pelosi prepared? Why weren't the Democrats prepared for that to happen?""
THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, they can say that, and you can make honest judgments about it. I have --
Look, I sometimes get myself in trouble for what I'm about to say -- (laughter) -- not that I ever get in trouble. (Laughs.) As you've heard me say before: No one ever doubts I mean what I say; the problem is I sometimes say all that I mean. And -- (laughter).
But all kidding aside, I have faith in the American people -- I really do -- to ultimately get to the right place.
And, by the way, many times Republicans are in the right place. I don't mean that the Repub- -- that it's always the Democratic point of view.
But some of the stuff -- I mean, QAnon: The idea that the Democrats or that Biden is hiding people and sucking the blood of children and -- no, I'm serious. That's --
Now, you may not like me, and that's your right. Look, it's a simple thing. You can walk out and say, ""I just don't like the way that guy wears his tie. I'm voting against him."" You have a right to do that. You have a right to do that.
But the kinds of things that are being said of late, I think you're beginning to see some of the -- and both -- and by Democrats as well -- sort of the venom get -- sort of -- sort of leak out a lot of it. We got to get beyond this.
What do you say to your grandchildren or you children about what's happening? Do you ever remember a time like this before, in the entire history, whether you're Democrat or Republican?
This is not who we are. And I'll say one last thing -- and you're going to -- I've had a lot of experience internationally. And I mean that -- not good or bad, just I have; I've chaired the Foreign Relations Committee. I've been deeply involved. I did national security for the -- our last -- the -- the -- the administration with Barack.
But, folks, the rest of the world is wondering about us. Those of you who travel abroad -- not a joke, not a joke -- you ask -- y",,,,,,,,,,,,,
u know, when I went to this G7, all the major democracies -- I walked in -- and I know a lot of them because of my role in the past. And they walk in and I said," """"America is back."""" And they go -- I'm serious", heads of state -- I give you my word as a Biden -- said," """"Are you really back? I mean", how can I -- we believe you, Joe," but will the country ever get it together?""""",,,,,,,
I talked to Xi -- Xi Jinping in China, who I know well. We don't agree on a lot of things. He's a bright and really tough guy. He truly believes that the 21st century will be determined by oligarchs, by -- and I'm not -- not a joke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Democracies cannot function in the 21st century -- the argument is -- because things are moving so rapidly -- so, so rapidly that you can't pull together a nation that is divided to get a consensus on acting quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, autocrats -- autocracies -- I had a long meeting with Putin, and I continued -- I know him well. These guys actually are betting -- betting -- I'm not joking -- on autocracies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Democracy has to stand up and demonstrate it can get something done. It's not just important that we are -- (applause) -- no, I really mean it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Mr. President, we're just getting started. We got a lot to talk about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: I'm sorry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: No, no, no. You're good. We're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back with more questions for the President of the United States right after this. (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,,
(Commercial break begins.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Commercial break ends.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Welcome back, everyone. We are live at a CNN Town Hall in Cincinnati, Ohio, with the President of the United States.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Straight to the audience for a question. This is John Lanni. He is the owner and co-founder of a restaurant group with 39 restaurants across the country, Mr. President. He is a Republican.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
John.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q: Hi there, Mr. President.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Hey, John.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q: Hi. Thank you for taking my question tonight. We employ hundreds of hard-working team members throughout the state of Ohio and across the country. And we're looking to hire more every day as we try to restart our restaurant business.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The entire industry, amongst other industries, continue to struggle to find employees. How do you and the Biden administration plan to incentivize those that haven't returned to work yet? Hiring is our top priority right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Well, two things. One, if you notice, we kept you open. We spent billions of dollars to make sure restaurants could stay open. And -- and a lot of people who now -- who work as waiters and waitresses decided that they don't want to do that anymore because there's other opportunities and higher wages, because there's a lot of openings now in jobs. And people are beginning to move -- beginning to move.,,,,,,,,,,,
There's some evidence that maintaining the ability to continue not -- to not have your -- have to pay your rent so you don't get thrown out, and being able to provide for unemployment insurance, has kept people from going back to work. There's no -- not much distinction between not going back to work in a restaurant and not going back to work at a -- at a factory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So people are looking to change opportunities, change what they're doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My -- my deceased wife's father-in-law was a restauranteur up in -- up in Syracuse, New York. And, by the way, he tried to con- -- he had a -- had a restaurant that was in a town called Auburn, about 20,000 people, which was at a flagship 24-hour-a-day restaurant that -- and he offered it to me, which I would have been making five times what I would in law school to try to keep me in Syracuse.,,,,,,,,
But I spent too many times at home hearing a -- in his home," hearing a phone call: """"The cook didn't come in? He's in a fight with his wife? What -- what's going on?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q: Exactly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: So I would -- God love you doing what you do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q: It's tough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But all kidding aside, I think it really is a matter of people deciding now that they have opportunities to do other things. And there is a shortage of employees. People are looking to make more money and to bargain. And so I think your business and the tourist business is really going to be in a -- in a bind for a little while. And one of the things -- we're ending all those things that are the things keeping people back from going back to work, et cetera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It'll be interesting to see what happens, but my gut tells me -- my gut tells me that part of it relates to -- you know, you can make a good salary as a waiter or waitress. One of my sister-in-laws is -- of five sisters -- makes a very good salary. She works in Atlantic City. That's where she's -- she's from. But it is -- there's a lot of people who -- who are looking to change their -- their occupation, I think. But I could be wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Well, let me ask you, because he's -- John is looking to hire people. He's got 39 restaurants across the country.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Is there anything you can do to help him out? I mean, he's -- he's got to get people in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Well, John -- first of all, I -- you know, the thing we did to help John and the Johns out is provide billions of dollars to make sure they could stay open. Number one. So you all contributed to making sure John could stay in business. (Applause.) And we should. We should have done that, as we did for other industries.,,,,,,,,,,,
But secondly, John, my guess is that people being $7, $8 an hour, plus tips, that -- that's -- I think, John, you're going to be finding -- (applause) -- 15 bucks an hour or more now. You know what I mean? But you may pay that already. You may pay that already.,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Well, let me -- let me ask you, because everywhere I go, there isn't pretty much a shop in my town, a restaurant or whatever," where there isn't a """"for hire"""" sign.",,,,,,,,,,
We were trying to check into the hotel; they couldn't get the rooms cleaned fast enough because they can't find staff. You mentioned something -- you said," """"We're going to end the things that may be keeping people back."""" You think that's the unemployment benefits expanded?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Well, that was the argument it was. I -- I -- I don't think it did much. But the point is, it's argued that because the extended unemployment benefits kept people --they'd rather stay home and not work -- than go to work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: You don't think it hurt? Did that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: I see no evidence it had any serious impact on it. But you can argue -- let's assume it did. It's coming to an end, so it's not like we're in a situation where -- if that was it and it ends, then we're going to see John is going to have no problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But what I think is happening, folks, is, look, if you make less than fift- -- and I'm not saying, John, your folks make less than 15 -- you had good restaurants; that means their tips are good, people make a lot more than just what the -- what the minimum wage -- what the wage is being paid on with the -- put tips on top of it.,,,,,,,,
But, folks, look, here's the deal. Think about it: You know, if you have an -- we -- for example, I want to be able to -- one of my programs is to make sure that we have four more years of school that's free -- two years for three-year-olds and four-year-olds, because it's demonstrated that that -- (applause) -- increases significantly success, and community college.,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Well, those folks are not likely to want to go and be waiters. There's nothing wrong being a waiter or waitress. My family has been engaged in that business. But the folks is --,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And, lastly, if you make less than 15 bucks an hour working 40 hours a week, you're living below the poverty level. You're living below the poverty level. (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: I want to continue on and talk about -- this has to do with infrastructure, because you got applause when you mentioned the bridge earlier -- (laughs) -- and --,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: By the way, your congressman wants that bridge too. (Laughter.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Todd Michael is here. He's a union electrician and a Democrat. He has a question about something that a lot of people in Cincinnati are concerned about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Todd, take it away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q: As Mr. Lemon said, you have already touched on the subject of my question. The two most recent presidents -- past presidents -- had both campaigned using this region's Interstate 75 Bridge -- the Brent Spence Bridge that crosses the Iowa River -- as backdrops with a promise of an infrastructure bill that would help with the replacement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
President Biden, is it possible to bring Congress together to pass an infrastructure bill that builds a bridge that does not just benefit this region, but the entire I-75 corridor, from Michigan all the way to Florida?,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: The answer is absolutely, positively yes. (Applause.) I'm not just saying that. I'm not just saying that. And if you take a look at Ohio and Kentucky combined, there's well over -- there's thousands of bridges that need repair. Thousands. Thousands of bridges.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And we should be looking at it this way: It increases commerce, number one. But guess what? They're good-paying union jobs. Union. (Applause.) Union jobs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And -- and -- and, by the way, can you ever think of a time -- those of you who are economists, who are -- who teach here, economics -- can you think of any time when the middle class did better, the wealthy didn't do really well?,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not being facetious now. I'm being deadly earnest. Can you think of any time that's occurred when the middle class does better? I'm tired of trickle down. I come from the corporate state of America. (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And, by the way, I think you should be able to go out and make a billion dollars or a hundred million dollars if you have the capacity to do it. But I ask one thing: Pay your fair share. (Applause.) Just pay your fair share. I really mean it. And if you know anything about me, check it out: We have more corporations registered in Delaware than all the rest of America combined. Combined. Combined. I represented it for 36 years. I've never seen a time when we have the middle class growing that the wealthy didn't do very, very, very well.,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: So, that's what we have to do: Build it out and up, not just down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Yeah. So that people like our next guest -- who just graduated from law school, by the way -- his name is Cory Marcum. He's a graduate from the University of Cincinnati Law School. And he --,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: He's a graduate, huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Excuse me, he's heading to law school -- I'm wrong -- in the fall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q: Yes. (Laughs.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: So, Cory, good luck in law school. And what's your question?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Your first year -- you wish you had already graduated. (Laughter.) I know. I -- me too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q: Yeah. (Laughs.) So, my question is: Last week, regarding the GOP's efforts to restrict voting rights, you said those efforts were, quote," """"the most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free and fair elections in our history", end quote. While you have condemned these attacks, you and congressional members of your party have done little to actually stop these assaults. If these efforts are really the most dangerous in our history, isn't it logical to get rid of the filibuster so we can protect our democracy and secure the right to vote? (Applause.),,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: I stand by what I said. Never before has there been an attempt by state legislatures to take over the ability to determine who won. Not count the votes -- determine who won.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have election officials across the board that they're deciding to push out of the way. And if, in fact, tomorrow -- let's say we're running last time and we're -- these laws had been in effect that are -- these changes. In Georgia, the Georgia legislature -- you know, Biden won by multiple thousand votes; they could say," """"We don't think it was legit."""" And the state legislature votes"," """"We're going send electors up to Congress to vote for Trump"," not Biden."""" That's never", ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever been tried before. This is Jim Crow on steroids what we're talking about.,
And so, it takes -- to go to your second point, I've been saying for a long, long time: The abuse of the filibuster is pretty overwhelming. When I got to the United States Senate at a time when we had guys like Jim Eastland and Strom Thurmond and Robert F. Byrd and a whole range of people who were very, very, very, very, very, very conservative on race, to say the least -- even then, if you were to filibuster, you had to stand on the floor and hold the floor. And that's why Strom, I think, set the record at 24 straight hours or something. Don't hold me to the number. But, you know, so you had to take -- there were significantly fewer filibusters in those days. In the middle of the civil rights movement.
MR. LEMON: But let me -- let me talk to you about that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me finish my answer, because I'll tell you what I'd do. I would go back to that where you have to maintain the floor. You have to stand there and talk and hold the floor. (Applause.) You can't just say that now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: I understand that. But what difference is that if you hold the floor for, you know, a day or a year? What difference does it make?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Here's the thing for me: You talked about people -- and this is important for people who look like me. My grandmother would sit around when I was a kid, fifth grade -- (applause) -- had a fifth-grade education. I learned that she couldn't read when I was doing my homework. And she would tell me stories about people asking her to count the number of jellybeans in the jar or the soap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And so why is protecting the filibuster -- is that more important than protecting voting rights, especially for people who fought and died for that? (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: No. It's not. I want to see the United States Congress, the United States Senate, pass S.1 and S.4, the John Lewis Act, and get it on my desk so I can sign it. (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,
But here's the deal: What I also want to do -- I want to make sure we bring along not just all the Democrats; we bring along Republicans, who I know know better. They know better than this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And what I don't want to do is get wrapped up, right now, in the argument of whether or not this is all about the filibuster or --,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look, the American public, you can't stop them from voting. You tried last time. More people voted last time than any time in American history, in the middle of the worst pandemic in American history. More people did. (Applause.) And they showed up. They're going to show up again. They're going to do it again.,,,,,,,,,,,,
But what I want to do is I'm trying to bring the country together. And I don't want the debate to only be about whether or not we have a filibuster or exceptions to the filibuster or the -- going back to the way the filibuster had to be used before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: But isn't that the only way you're going to get it done right now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: No, I don't believe that. I think we can get it done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: If you -- if you -- you agree with the former president; he has called -- as you call him," your """"old boss"""" -- that it's """"a relic of Jim Crow.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: It is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: If it's a relic of Jim Crow, it's been used to fight against civil rights legislation historically, why protect it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: There's no reason to protect it other than you're going to throw the entire Congress into chaos and nothing will get done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Nothing at all will get done. And there's a lot at stake. The most important one is the right to vote. That's the single most important one. And your vote counted, and counted by someone who honestly counts it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it goes beyond that. For example, wouldn't -- wouldn't my friends on the other side love to have a debate about the filibuster instead of passing the recovery act? Or wouldn't they love doing it instead of being in a position where we provide for -- how many of you have children under the age of 17? Raise your hand. Guess what? You're getting a lot of money in a monthly check now, aren't you? (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,,,
No, you deserve -- (applause) -- no, no, no, I really mean it. Republicans used to fight for it as well. It's called the Child Tax Credit. If you have a child under the age of seven, you get 300 bucks a month -- 350 bucks a month. If you have a child under -- between 7 and 17, you get a total of 200 bucks a month. And guess what? It's cutting child poverty in half. In half. (Applause.),,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Mr. President, I want to talk about something else that affects people a lot, and to children as well. The next question -- and it's about gun violence. This is from a paralegal and she's an advocate. Her name is Andrea Solis Canto. She's a Democrat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Andrea, go ahead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: I used to be a public defender, kid. Thanks for what you're doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q: (Laughs.) Thank you. So, gun violence has been on the rise across the country, and as a recent student and young professional living in Over-the-Rhine, I've seen this firsthand. Gun violence has taken the lives of so many young students and young people. I'm tired, and I want to see change that's going to make our cities, like Cincinnati, safer.,,,,,,,,,
So, how will you address gun violence, from a federal point of view, to actually bring about change and make our local cities safer?,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Now, I'm not being a wise guy. There's no reason you should -- have you seen my gun violence legislation I've introduced? As you know -- because you're so involved -- actually, crime is down; gun violence and murder rates are up. Guns. I'm the only guy that ever got passed legislation, when I was a senator, that made sure we eliminated assault weapons. The idea you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 20,30,40,50, 120 shots from that weapon -- whether it's a -- whether it's a 9-millimeter pistol or whether it's a rifle -- is ridiculous.,,,,,,,
I'm continuing to push to eliminate the sale of those things, but I'm not likely to get that done in the near term. So here's what I've done: The people who, in fact, are using those weapons are acquiring them illegally -- illegally. And so what happens is, I've gotten ATF -- Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms -- I have them increase their budget and increase their capacity, along with the Justice Department, to go after the gun shops that are not abiding by the law of doing background checks. (Applause.) For real. That's number one.,,,,,,,
Number two -- number two, we're in a position where you -- most of the cities -- and I don't know enough -- I think you've had a lot of gun violence here in Cincinnati. I think it was up to -- what? -- how many -- how many how dead? Five hundred over a period. Don't hold me to the number -- whatever it was. But my point is, all across the country. And it's not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns. They are either shadow gun dealers and/or gun shops that are not abiding by the law.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So," we're going to do major investigations and shut those guys down and put some of them in jail and -- for what they're doing: selling these weapons. There's also a thing called """"ghost guns"""" that are being sold now and being used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And so -- but in addition to that, what we have to do is we have to deal with a larger problem of the whole issue of law enforcement, generally. We're in a situation where, as much as we need to pass the Floyd Act and all that -- but here's the deal: Cops are having real trouble. They're not all bad guys; there's a lot of good guys. We need more policemen, not fewer policemen. But we need them involved in community policing. Community policing. (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,
And when we did that, violent crime went down. All the criticism about the original crime bill -- well, guess what? Crime went down until we stopped doing community policing. So it's about getting -- we have availability now of over billion -- lots of money for cops to be able to hire psychologists, psychiatrists, as well as social workers to be engaged in the process. (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Mr. President, we're going to put a period, maybe a comma right here because we have more to come. We got to take a quick break.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We'll be right back. More from President Joe Biden right after this. (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Commercial break begins.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Commercial break ends.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Welcome back to our CNN Town Hall with the President of the United States, Joe Biden. I just -- I said we were going to put a comma on it because I want to continue this conversation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You said that you need -- we need more police, right? Your words. So then, how do you respond to Republicans who try to paint you and your party as anti-police?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: They're lying. (Applause.) No, look, never once -- we have to change police conduct. We have to have rules where things are open. We have to have rules where you can be able to determine what the background -- how many times a cop has violated the rules and be able to have access to what's going on in police departments, or the Justice Department can get involved in whether or not they have to change their pattern and practices.,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've always said that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MR. LEMON: But what about defunding the police though? Because there's a """"Defund the Police.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: No, I've never -- never, never said defunding the police.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look, I don't know any community, particularly the communities that are in the most need and the poorest and the most at risk, that don't want police. They want police, though, to look at them as equals. (Applause.) They want police to treat them in a way. They don't want police abusing.,,,,,,,,,,
And what happened was we got in the position where -- we used to have community policing where the cop -- my deceased son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. And what we did when that original bill got passed was he would go down in the tough neighborhoods in my -- in my state -- in my city of Wilmington, which is overwhelming a minority city, and he'd go where the -- everybody can tell me where the best basketball is played in a playground here in this city. You know where it is; you know who the best ballplayers are; you know where they are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He'd go down and sit there on the bench with his son, my -- my grandson, who's now 16, when he was 5 and 6 years old, and let them know he was there. He'd go over and knock on the window of the local cop, who was sitting there by himself in a squad car. I'd say," """"Get out of the car. Meet people.""""",,,,,,,,,
Because what used to happen was cops used to -- when first community policing came about -- they'd go in and they knew who the minister was in the church, they knew who owned the local liquor store, the local drugstore, the local grocery store. And they'd walk in and say," """"Look", I'm Joe Biden, and I'm going to be in this beat. Here's my cell number. You have a problem," call me. Here's my cell number.""""",,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: You said it's tough right now. You said police are up against -- well, they're up against the narrative that, you know, the country is anti-police, Democrats are anti-police, Joe Biden is anti-police. And then you have --,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: They aren't saying Joe Biden is anti-police. Cops are not saying that about Joe Biden. They know me, period. (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Go on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: They're not saying. Republicans are saying it on the far -- I'm not going to -- anyway, it doesn't matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: No, you can -- no, I want you to talk about this, because -- I mean --,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: No, look --,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: -- it's an important narrative. There is no more important issue, I think, right now than safety. You can rebuild a home. You can, you know, get a lot of things back. But, Mr. President, you cannot get back a life. And it --,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: That's exactly right. That's exactly right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Yeah. And if police aren't doing their jobs, that increases --,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Okay -- no, if police aren't doing their job, they should be held accountable. They should be fired if they're not doing their job. They should -- (applause) -- I have no -- I make no excuses for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We should have, for example, the George Floyd Act, where chokeholds are against the law, where a whole lot of things that are laid out in that legislation. And, by the way, I grew up in a neighborhood where you became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn't qualified for any one of them, so here I am. (Laughter.),,,,,,
But all kidding aside -- I'm not joking -- the guys that grew up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware -- a steel town -- that's what we did. That's what they did. It's what my friends did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And here's the point: The point is that they -- it doesn't justify maltreating the public. You have no right to do that. None. But now what's happening is, because they've become -- it's become so tough across the spectrum, we've actually cut down on a number of police, unrelated to anybody asking for it. The towns and cities aren't spending as much money on it. There is not as much federal money to hire police. And now, what's happening is police are not wanting to be a cop. Raise your hand if you want to be a cop now. What do you think, huh?,,,,,,,,,,
So what we got to do is we got to give them the help they need to be better at their job. The idea that you have someone sitting on a ledge, saying they're going to jump off a ledge, and you call the cop, and sending a guy or a woman who's a law enforcement officer, has a criminal justice degree, when you could send with him or her -- you could send with them a psychologist or a social worker, or somebody who can talk to them.,,,,,,,,,
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: No, I mean it. (Applause.) I'm serious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Mr. President, I want to get to more questions now. I'm going to bring in Lynne Miller. She's an attorney and a Democrat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lynne, what's your question?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q: Mr. President, the opioid crisis continues, and in this part of the country, it remains a huge problem. While the over-prescription of opioids is part of that problem, the drugs available in the black market are a growing issue as many of these contain fentanyl. That took the life of our son. How can your administration combat the issue of illegal opiates, many of which our young people buy online? Someone should bear responsibility for delivering death through the mail.,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: They should bear responsibility. You may or may not be aware: Even in the period when I was out of office, I was railing against the fact that drug companies were selling on the open market. There was one case -- what's really got me was you had two drugstores in small town in West Virginia having something like prescription for 4,000 pills. And it was obviously drug trafficking. That's what was going on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So what we did was -- what they did was, they went after it. They just settled with Johnson & -- some of the drug companies who make opioids for twenty-si- -- was it $26 billion or 27. Today, if I'm not mistaken, the settlement took place.,,,,,,,,,,,,
But here's the deal: In addition to that, you have the Chinese sending fentanyl to Mexico, in large part, that's being mixed with opioids and/or heroin and other drugs, which is a dead-set killer of people.,,,,,,,,,,,
And so, what we have to do -- I've had this encounter with China, and we're going to continue it. But we've also increased the number of DEA agents -- what we're doing at the border -- and how we're going to deal with ex- -- the intercepting that drug trade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In addition to that, the Justice Department is moving on dealing with the whole opioid issue by increasing significantly the number -- the number of people in Justice Department working on this issue. And so, there's much more to say about it, but it is incredibly, incredibly dangerous.,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Mr. President, I believe there's no better way to speak about this than --,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible) --,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: -- from experience. I don't think there's probably a family in this room who hasn't been affected by addiction. You've been very open about your son Hunter's problems with addiction. This is personal for you. And listen, I've dealt with it in -- within my own family. Every family deals with it. But this is personal for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Yes. And I'm so damn proud of my son. My son just wrote a book about how he overcame being addicted. And he did it, and he's doing it, and he is in good shape, thank God.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Here's the thing: We don't have nearly enough people involved in mental health and drug addiction services -- number one. (Applause.) Number one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Number two -- number two, we shouldn't be sending people to jail for use; we should be sending them to mandatory rehabilitation. (Applause.) Mandatory rehabilitation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Number three, when people are in fact in jail, they should be getting -- if that's not the main crime, but they also did -- they should be getting treatment while they are in jail.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fourth, when people get out of jail -- whether it's for drug addiction or any other crime -- if they've served their time, they should have full access to everything from Pell Grants, to public housing, to -- to the like. (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,
And, by the way -- and, by the way, folks, it's not just the right thing to do; it's the smart thing for us to do. Because what happens? Years ago, there was a guy named Arlen Specter from Pennsylvania. He and I introduced legislation that was a second chance. It would -- meant that, right now, when you get out of jail in most prisons in the states around the country -- what happens? -- you get a bus ticket and 25 bucks. You end up under the bridge, just like you did before. You're almost -- almost guaranteed to get back in -- in whatever -- whatever your problem was before.,,,,,,,
So, they should have access to drug treatment. They should have access to housing. They should have access to whatever they qualify based on their income. And we should, in prisons as well, be training people differently.,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the mi- -- the big thing here is: We have to deal with the idea of addiction by providing for what we all know -- it's a disease of the brain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: It's a disease of the brain and has to be treated as such.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: I think it's -- I think addiction and mental health issues have to be dealt with, just as if you break your arm and go to the doctor. We should be able to talk. There should be --,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: I agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: -- there shouldn't be a stigma about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I want to bring in now Madeena Nolan. Madeena Nolan is a writer and editor. She's a Democrat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Madeena, what's your question?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Hi, Madeena.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q: Good evening, Mr. President. Vice President Harris said to Guatemalans," """"Don't come."""" Recently", you have indicated you are in favor of refugees coming to this country. Could you please explain your administration's basic stance on immigration?,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Yes. They should not come.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What we're trying to set up is, in the countries like in -- and particularly in the Northern Triangle -- Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, et cetera -- we are setting up in those countries: If you seek asylum in the United States, you can seek it from the country, from your -- in place. You can seek it from an American embassy. You can go in and seek and see whether or not you qualify. We've significantly increased the number of officers who can hear cases as to whether or not you qualify under the law for being here as a refugee. That is -- that's what we've done.,,,,,,,,,
Thirdly, we have enabled a move, significantly, to change the number -- there were thousands of people in -- in custody with the Border Patrol. It's now cut by 90 percent, where there -- it's considerably down.,,,,,,,,,,,
What I -- what I do say is: The one place you may heard that I'm talking about more immigrants coming in are those folks from Afghanistan who helped the American soldiers, who will be -- they and their family will be victimized very badly as a consequence of what happens if they're left behind. And so, we're providing for them to be able to see whether they qualify to meet this special requirement to be able to come to the United States as a refugee and as, ultimately, earning citizenship here. It seems to me it's the only decent thing that we can do.,,,,,,,,,,,
In the meantime, we're going to send people to American bases, where they're not going to be able to leave the base while their cases are being determined -- whether they qualify -- and also other bases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: I want to talk to you about DACA. I got two questions on immigration. They're quick questions I want to ask you about. Because just last week, there was a federal judge who ruled the program unlawful, blocked it from accepting new applications. What do you say to DREAMers who are really worried about their futures here in the United States?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: I'm not letting this go. Look, guys, let's just put it -- (applause) -- let's just put this -- you know, we talk about DREAMers sort of generically. Let's think about it now, what it really means: You're five years old. You're nine years old. Your mom or your dad says," """"I'm going to take you across the Rio Grande and we're going to illegally going to go into the United States."""" What are you supposed to say? """"Not me. That's against the law""""? I'm --no", I'm being -- I'm being deadly earnest. What can a kid say? What could they do? They come here with really no choice. And they're here, and they're good, good people. They've done well. (Applause.) Ten thousand of them were first-line workers. (Applause.) These are kids who've done well.,,,,,,,
And so, what we're going to do is, first of all, appeal the case -- number one. But number two, we're going to make sure that -- a number of my Republican colleagues say they support the right of DREAMers to come. Let's call the question. They should be able to stay in the United States of America when a child comes (inaudible). (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Mr. President, you've been the big guy for six months now in the White House. Can you take us behind the scenes -- something that was extraordinary or unusual that happened that stands out to you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. """"Mr. President", you didn't close the door. Mr. President," what the hell are you going out at this time for?"""" You know. (Laughter.) You know", it's -- it's a wonderful honor. As you can tell, I hope I have very good manners, but I'm not very hung up on protocol. (Laughter.),,,,,,,,,,
And I -- and the Secret Service is wonderful. And because things are so -- (applause) -- and because things are so crazy out there, it is very hard to get comfortable like I would ordinarily be. For example, I think all of the -- all the help that's there, providing meals and all the rest -- I think they love us. We can say," """"Don't come in for breakfast. We can get our own breakfast."""" Because I like to walk out in my robe and go in. (Laughter.) No", no, I'm not -- you think I'm joking. I'm not. You know what I mean?,,,,,,,,,
And so it's just a -- you know, the only place I have felt like what the office connotes is when I went to Europe and watched the rest of the heads of state react to me -- not me, because I'm the President of the United States of America -- the United States of America.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And here's what happened: It's the first time I ever felt like -- you always hear say """"leader of the free world."""" Well", I realize, when I'm sitting across from Putin, who I know, he knows who I am; I know who he is. He knows I mean what I say and can do what I say. He understands. It doesn't mean he will do it or not do it. But the point is it's the first time I've ever felt the notion that I am in the office that is the leader of the free world. And we must be the leader of the free world. If we don't do it, nobody good is likely to do it or has the capacity to do it. I really mean it. I genuinely mean it.,,,,,,,,,,
So, it's the thing, Don, that is the only time -- and, by the way," the first time I walked downstairs and they played """"Hail to the Chief", I wondered," """"Where is he?"""" (Laughter.) No", you think I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. You know, I mean --,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: It's a great tune, isn't it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: It's a great tune, but I -- you know, you feel a little self-conscious. (Laughter.) But you think I'm kidding. I'm not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I am -- I am not at all self-conscious about the power that goes with the office as it relates to resolving issues. These are issues that I've dealt with my whole life. Whether I'm good or bad, I have more experience coming to the office than anyone who's ever held that office. I have done -- I've -- I've been deeply steeped in foreign policy, the justice system, the econo- -- not that I'm right. I don't mean that. But nothing has come before me where I've gone," """"Oh", my God," I never -- I never thought…""""",,,,,,,,,
You know, what the difference is -- I used to kid Barack -- he's a good friend -- President Obama. And, you know, at one point, I'd always be the -- I was always the last guy in the room, for real. On every important decision, I got to give my advice. I'd give it all away, but I'd be the last guy before I walked out. And one day, he thanked me. And I said," """"Mr. President", here's the deal: I should be paying you, not you me, because I get to give the advice," and then I get to leave."""" (Laughter.)",,
No, I'm serious. Think about it. The one thing that is real, that is different -- I don't -- and I feel comfortable with it -- but is you're the last guy in the room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: You decide," """"Is the decision I'm about to make", will that cause war? Will that cause conflict? The decision I'm about to make," is that going to hurt people? Is it going to help people?"""" That's the part that is different.",,,,,,,,,,,,
But the living conditions, I mean, it's such a great, great honor to live in the White House. But, quite frankly -- I kid the Vice President -- like, one day, Barack came over to NAVOBS -- it's called Naval Operations [sic] -- the Vice President's Residence -- which is on about, I guess,80, 90 acres. And it's a beautiful, beautiful spot. And there's a fence around the whole property.,,,,,
MR. LEMON: I bet you miss that, don't you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: I do. (Laughter.) And Barack came over and he said," """"This is great."""" And I said"," """"I'll tell you…"""" And I said"," """"Trade you only if the power goes with it.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,
But the point is that, there, it was totally different. You could walk out in your shorts -- with a short-sleeve shirt on, and you can walk around and there wasn't anybody there. You can't walk out anywhere now. (Laughter.) But I'm not complaining. I'm trying to answer your question as honestly as I can.,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: I just -- it's the greatest honor, I think, could ever be bestowed on an American that a majority of American citizens said," """"I want you to lead the country."""" And it's a great honor -- a great honor when you have presidents and prime ministers and the rest of the world saying"," """"You know"," what does the United States think?"""" You're the leader of the free world.",,,,,,,,,,
I was able to go to the G7 and change their mind about a whole range of things. They never once had included China in any criticism on what was going on. They're very reluctant to be able to be in a position -- you and I have talked about this -- about whether or not they're going to do business with China in a way that, you know, pushes America aside.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of a sudden, if you notice, we're getting a great deal -- not because of me, but because of the administration I put together. And America is back; traditional America is more back. And they're willing to follow us, I think. (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,
Q: Well, Mr. President -- Mr. President, here's the deal. Mr. President, here's the deal: I'm the last guy that gets to ask you questions tonight.,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Uh-oh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: Yeah. And then I get to leave. (Laughter.) Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Thanks, man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: I appreciate it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE PRESIDENT: Appreciate it. (Applause.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. LEMON: We're so glad that you guys are here and that you got to ask questions to the President of the United States. Thank you so much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

20-Jul-21,Remarks Prior to a Cabinet Meeting and an Exchange with Reporters,"THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, today -- today's Cabinet meeting, I want to give a brief progress report as to where I think we are and the job you're doing in the first six months.
First, the pandemic. I know folks are watching the number of cases rising again and wondering, quite frankly, what it means to them. But overall -- overall, COVID-19 deaths are down dramatically -- dramatically. And these last six months, about 90 percent down due to our vaccination program. And I want to thank you all for the great job you did in getting that done.
But we have to stay vigilant, especially with the Delta variant that's out there. While COVID-19 cases are rising, virtually all of the COVID death -- virtually all of the COVID deaths and hospitalizations are from unvaccinated people. Let me say it again: Virtually all are from unvaccinated people.
And that means the safest thing to do is to get vaccinated -- get vaccinated. And that's why we're focusing, on our next phase, on getting the unvaccinated vaccinated. I know it seems like a constant uphill climb, but it's gradually -- we're making progress, but we've got a way to go yet.
Secondly, the economy. Yesterday -- that I spoke of the historic economic progress we've made, which starts with the American Rescue Plan: shots in arms that saved a lot of lives; checks and tax cuts to give them just a little extra breathing room -- ordinary Americans; and -- and lower healthcare costs, just when so many Americans needed that help. And it's helped create 3 million -- 3 million jobs -- more than any administration has done in the first six months of being in office -- again, thanks to all of you.
And with our Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and our Build Back Better plan, I think we can turn this -- this great movement into a economic boom for some time to come. And I really mean that. I think we're in a cusp -- not only getting us out of the hole, but setting us on a -- on a path that's going to generate significant continued economic growth.
And the American people are overwhelmingly supportive of our plans -- that's support that a lot of our friends and the other team kind of miss. The polling data shows that they strongly support -- strongly support our effort for infrastructure.
I think they're a little tired of Infrastructure Week for four years in a row. I think we're on the verge of me being able to get something really done -- rebuilding roads and bridges; replacing lead water pipes; delivering high-speed Internet to every American -- rural and inner-city; and taking on the climate crisis with -- with American jobs.
And they want us to build back -- to build back better. They don't know the name necessarily, but they know that they support universal pre-K and two years of community college; paid leave and childcare, which is essentially a significant tax cut for working-class families; and allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug costs, which will significantly reduce drug prices across the board for people.
And they support asking the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans and corporate America not to pay more than they should; just begin to pay their fair share, just step up a little bit.
The idea that 50 of the largest corporations in America pay no tax, it's -- I -- I think people should be able to be millionaires and billionaires if they have the ideas, but, Lord's sake, the idea -- let's start paying your fair share.
And third thing is, there are -- and, by the way, there's overwhelming evidence, in the polling data, they support what we're doing -- is how to pay for these programs.
Thirdly, restoring American leadership in the world. I know you all have -- those of you who've travelled around the world -- I know our Ambassador to the United Nations knows it full well -- that America has -- is really behind the eight-ball the last four years. We've lost a lot of our standing. I don't have to tell that to my buddy sitting to my right here -- the Secretary of State. He understands it well.
And as I've said before, we are -- we are defining -- in a defining competition right now for the 21st century -- for the second quarter of the 21st century -- with China and many other nations. And many of these nations believe that autocracy is the future; that democracies cannot compete with autocracies because it's so hard -- things are moving so rapidly, technologically and otherwise, that democracies can't get the act together enough to get a consensus on how to move.
Well, I reject that most -- notion completely, and I think the vast majority of American people do as well.
You know, in my conversations and meetings with world leaders -- just coming back from, I guess, about eight, nine days over there, ending with a -- a meeting with Putin -- you know, I'm making it absolutely clear that democracy is more capable -- more capable, and America is back, whether it's helping vaccinate the world.
And we're not just vaccinating ourselves. We're going to do -- we're going to vac- -- help vaccinate the world. We're building back better to create jobs and grow the middle class not just at home, everywhere. It's in our interests the economic -- the economies of these other nations grow.
And we're going to lead the fight against the climate crisis and tackling -- tackling the challenges of cybersecurity. We've been very clear to our -- our -- other nations as to what we expect in terms of their conduct.
And finally, there's much more to be done and so much more to do -- tackling voting rights, which is an existential threat to democracy right now. The things that are being asked are just beyond the pale. And the Vice President has been working hard on this issue and is going to continue to -- we all are -- but there's much more to do. We have to tackle the immigration problem, which we're working really hard to get done in a humane and serious way. Police reform and crime.
And the bottom line is: We're delivering on our promises. We have to deliver on all of the promises we made. Because I think we're in a situation where the vast majority of the public agrees with the essence of what we're trying to do.
And so, I just think that we're showing there's nothing that America is unable to do when we do it together.
And so, you know, I think it's time for us to -- to stop now so we can get started with our meeting. So, are you ready, folks, to go to work?
PARTICIPANTS: Yes.
Q: Mr. President, quickly: Do you think vac- -- do you think vaccinated people should start wearing masks?
Q: (Cross-talk.)

20-Jul-21,Remarks Honoring the Super Bowl LV Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers,"THE PRESIDENT: Well, good morning, I think -- still ""good morning."" And it's great to see everybody here. I want to thank the -- the representatives here. The Second Gentleman is here. Representative Castor, Crist --
PARTICIPANT: (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT: Okay, you got -- (laughs). I'll tell you, that Florida thing is something else. Anyway. (Laughter.)
And Soto and Murphy and Franklin. And one of my best friends in the world -- now he's coming back from outer space -- Bill Nelson, who runs NASA now.
We're here today to congratulate and welcome to the White House the Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. (Applause.) To the players, the coaches, and the Glazer family -- my good friends -- it's an honor to have you here.
We have to say that the fans down in Western Florida are having a pretty good year this year. I tell you, you know, the Stanley Cup and -- in addition to the Super Bowl. But, you know, we're making a pretty strong case to start calling Tampa the ""City of Champions.""
And -- (applause) -- the -- this Buccaneer team is a testament of the fact that it's never too late to come together and achieve extraordinary things. Three quarters of the way through the season, they found themselves in the middle of the pack: seven wins and five losses.
But this is a team that didn't fold and always got up, dug deep. They won their last four games of the season and then stormed through the playoffs -- winning on the road in Washington, New Orleans, and Green Bay -- and capping it all off back home in Tampa to become the first team to win the Super Bowl on their home turf in a decisive victory against the defending champs, the Kansas City Chiefs.
You know, it's an incredible run by one of the most well-rounded teams in recent memory. A pair of All-Pro linebackers. Star pass rushers. A dangerous secondary. A dominant offensive line. And a legendary tight end who gave up what, I'm told, was a promising career to return to -- acting career -- to return to the game.
And most importantly, you've got a star receiver from Delaware. I'm mildly prejudiced about that. (Laughter and applause.) Where's Chris? Where are you, Chris? There you go. (Applause.)
I called him before the game to tell him -- to give him some tips on how to run some patterns. That was a -- (laughter).
But, you know, born in Pennsylvania, raised in Delaware. Where I come from, that's a heck of a combination, man. You know, Chris and I had a chance to speak before the Super Bowl. And I know, like me, he takes a lot of pride in his home state of Delaware. Chris, you're inspiring a whole lot of kids back home in Delaware.
And he went to a -- by the way, he went to a high school called Middletown -- a perennial winner of the state championship. But I pointed out to him, when my son, Hunter, was a senior, he went to my Alma Mater's high school named -- by the way, all sit down. What are we -- just standing? I'm sorry. (Laughter.)
I -- you know, and I told him my son scored the scoring touchdown at Archmere and won the state championship that year. But, anyway, that's -- we don't -- we don't count those things. You know, I've never met an athlete that doesn't remember every damn play he made.
And, of course, two other guys worth mentioning: the coach and the quarterback. You know, a lot has been made about the fact that we have the oldest coach ever to win a Super Bowl and the oldest quarterback to win the Super Bowl.
Well, I'll tell you right now: You won't hear any jokes about that from me. As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing wrong with being the oldest guy to make it to the mountaintop. That's how I look at it. (Applause.)
And, Tom, looking at you, you've got about 20 more years left. You're just about the best ever to play. And making it to 10 Super Bowls in the last 20 years -- that ain't bad, man. (Laughter.) I'll tell you what, we've never seen anything like it in the game.
And, of course, these guys all know that sports are more than just a game. It's something -- some of my strongest memories, most enduring memories and lessons and cherished friendships come from the days I played -- not went anywhere near anybody on that stage. I started in grade school playing in CYO league.
And I'll never forget getting knocked out when I was in fifth grade, and my dad -- walking off -- he said, ""Get up. Get up. Get up. Unless something is broken, get up."" Well, I think that's what sports tell you: You just get up. You get up.
I went to the University of Delaware to play football, although it didn't very do much for my career -- I didn't do very well. But, you know, I found out that your career can be embellished a little over time. It's an amazing kind of thing.
You know, there's an awards banquet that, many years later -- which is called the Timmie Awards -- was it? -- and was held here in Washington. Supreme Court Justices and Presidents would show up to this big banquet. And the University of Delaware football program received the award, and I had a chance to introduce a Hall of Fame coach, one of my -- the backfield coach when I played. I didn't play much. His name was Tubby Raymond. And -- and so, I got up and I said, ""Here is my coach, Tubby Raymond."" Made -- said some nice things about Tubby.
Tubby was really, kind of, nervous and -- standing in front of Presidents and Supreme Court Justices and so many distinguished people. And he went up on -- on to talk about what an incredible ball player I was at the University of Delaware. (Laughter.) It was amazing. It was amazing. That's why I decided to run for President. I figured, if he was still around and I'd get to be elected President, I would've been an All-American. (Laughter.) I could've been big. I could've been big.
But all kidding aside, you guys did it the hard way. And I hope you all know just how important it was for -- after such a tough year for the nation. In the middle of a long, dark winter, every Sunday, people were able to sit down and watch you play. You created memories that helped folks make it through and believe that we could get back to normal again. And you did it as a team, trailblazing, including the first team with two women full-time coaching positions. (Applause.)
And realizing that of the -- of the 25 or 26 Glazer grandchildren and about 24 of them being women -- you had no choice. It's about time they stepped up. Right, guys?
Anyway, all kidding aside, the step -- your team stepped up off the field, too, donating millions of meals to families in need; helping Americans exercise their sacred right to vote, including at Raymond James Stadium. Your stadium also became a lifeline for families in Tampa Bay this spring, administering nearly 200,000 vaccine shots. And you all who don't have a shot, man: Get one, okay?
PARTICIPANT: Amen.
THE PRESIDENT: Get one. Get one. (Applause.)
And you're saving lives -- helping us get back our lives and loved ones.
And I want to thank the NFL for setting strong vaccination goals so fans can go see a game without it becoming a super-spreader event.
Getting vaccinated is about staying healthy and understanding that no one is invincible, even if you are young and you're fit. It's about looking out for those and the frontline workers out there, like the ones the team played in front of on Super Bowl Sunday.
Those workers remind us of a quintessential lesson about sports and America itself. That no matter how much and how many times we get knocked down, we always get up. We come back. We come back stronger together and achieve incredible things -- just like your team did, just like we're doing as a country.
So, congratulations, and thank you all for being here. Good luck to you all this season. And now let me bring up Bryan to say a few words. (Applause.)
MR. GLAZER: Mr. President, on behalf of our family, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers coaches, players, and staff, and all of our loyal fans, thank you for hosting us today. It's an honor for us to be at the White House.
For our family and fans, this day has been nearly 20 years in the making. Because despite this being our second Super Bowl Championship, this our first visit to the White House. In 2003, following our Super Bowl 37 victory, there were world events that prevented us to visit. So that makes today even more special.
And we're here today because this team did the impossible: new players, including a new quarterback; no offseason mini camps; no preseason; limitations on meetings,; rules and regulations were changing every day. But they stayed focused and went on to win their final eight games, as the President spoke about, and became the first team to win the Super Bowl at home. Amazing.
It's only fitting that as we enter the 46th season in Tampa Bay Buccaneer history that we celebrate it with the 46th President of the United States.
We start this season with only one goal in mind: It's to come back here next summer and spend a Super Bowl victory again with you. (Applause.)
MR. ARIANS: Thank you, Mr. President, for giving us this day. It -- I get emotional, but it's very, very special. This is actually my third time; it never gets old.
And I want to thank our coaches, our players, our entire organization -- men, women that did such a great job last year of coming together and banding together -- not to beat the other team; we had to beat the virus first. And you sacrificed more than any team I've ever been around -- players, coaches, your families -- to make sure that we had our team on the field every Sunday.
And it's a great compliment to all of you. I can't say enough about our owners, the Glazer family. They're the best owners I've ever known and ever been around. Our players are outstanding. They do what they're supposed to do on and off the field because they take care of each other.
We live by three words: trust, loyalty, and respect. We don't have any rules. If you have those, you'll have accountability and you'll be able to do anything you want. One team, one cause.
I hope the Senate and the House start helping you. (Applause.) One team, one cause.
All right. Again, thank you all for having us here. Thank you, Mr. President. And Go Bucs. (Applause.) And Tom has got some stuff to say.
MR. BRADY: Thank you, Mr. President. It's certainly an honor to be here. Thank you very much for your hospitality your entire staff has given us today. I think what -- behind me is an amazing group of players. We have a bunch of coaches and staff here sitting down.
And it was actually a very challenging season for a lot of reasons, but we bonded together, we worked really hard, we put all our individual agendas aside, and we came together as a team.
And sports has an amazing way of bringing people together. If you look at us, we're all a little bit different ages. I'm a little older than most of them. But we come from a lot of different places across the country, a lot of different schools, a lot of different backgrounds, but we love each other; we're committed to one another. And when you do that, amazing things happen.
And these guys are amazing group of men. It didn't look great there at one point. We were seven and five, struggling a little bit, as the President alluded to. But we found our rhythm. We got on a roll.
Not a lot of people, you know, think that we could have won. And, in fact, I think about 40 percent of the people still don't think we won.
THE PRESIDENT: I understand that. (Laughter.)
MR. BRADY: You understand that, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: I understand that.
MR. BRADY: Yeah. And personally, you know, it's nice for me to be back here. We had a game in Chicago where I forgot what down it was. I lost track of one down in 21 years of playing, and they started calling me ""Sleepy Tom."" (Laughter.) Why would they do that to me?
THE PRESIDENT: I don't know. (Laughter.)
MR. BRADY: So, it's great to be -- you know, we're on the eve of football season. We start, tomorrow, practice. And we're going to do everything we can to work to achieve another one of those Lombardi trophies.
It's a different group of men. It'll be a different challenge, but we're excited for it. We're excited for the opportunity to compete and work hard and show everyone what we're made of.
So, we're not going to throw the Super Bowl trophy this time, Cam, but we're going to offer President Biden a special presentation from Mr. Glazer. And then we're going to challenge 11 of us, 11 White House interns to game of football here on the lawn, and we intend to run it up on you guys, so -- (laughter) -- get ready to go. Thank you. (Applause.)
(The President is presented with a Buccaneers jersey.) (Applause.)

19-Jul-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting with King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,"PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, I'm -- I want to welcome back to the White House a good, loyal, and decent friend, His Majesty. And we've been hanging out together for a long time. I met him back when he was in the situation his son is, when his father was alive and I was a young senator. And it's good to have him back in the White House.
You know, I want to thank you, Your Majesty, for your enduring and strategic relationship with the United States. You've always been there, and we will always be there for Jordan.
And in addition to that, we -- we were talking -- we had an opportunity to speak just a moment in the Diplomatic Room. And we talked about how our -- our children and my children were -- had to finish off their senior year in college on Zoom.
And we talked about the COVID pro- -- crisis. We were able to be a little bit of help to Jordan, and we hope to be able to help some more and -- in this pandemic.
And I also want to thank you for your vital leadership in the Middle East. You live in a tough neighborhood. And the fact is, I look forward to hearing from His Majesty about the pressing challenges that -- (a cellphone disrupts the event) -- that Jordan faces. And whoever's -- is that a call for me on the phone? (Laughter.) And we're going to continue to stre- -- to strengthen our bilateral cooperation.
The world is changing. And you always -- they always kid me. I'm always quoting Irish poets. It says -- there was a famous poem -- ""All changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born."" But a lot has changed and a lot of opportunity, but also a lot of difficulty we're going to have to work our way through.
So, welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome.
KING ABDULLAH II: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.
Mr. President, thank you, as always, for the kindness that you showed me. And as you alluded to, I had the honor and the privilege of knowing you with my father decades ago. And so this is very warming for me to be able to see you in this position and to thank you for the generosity you always have shown me and my country.
You alluded to supporting us with vaccines. So, on behalf of Jordan and the people of Jordan, thank you so much for the leadership you've shown not only in supporting our country, but fighting COVID internationally. You've set the standard for the rest of us to follow.
We come together as always strong partners. We have, as you said, many challenges in our part of the world. I think many of us leaders from our part of the world will do the heavy lifting, which is what we need to do, on behalf of the United States. But you can always count on me, my country, and many of our colleagues in the region. A lot to do, sir, but with your leadership, we will prevail.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, as my grandfather used to say: ""With the grace of God and the goodwill to the neighbors,"" we'll be able to get a lot done.

19-Jul-21,Remarks on the Economy and an Exchange with Reporters,"THE PRESIDENT: Well, good morning. Tomorrow marks exactly six months since my administration began. I think it's a fitting moment to take a look at our economy -- where we were six months ago, what we've achieved since then, and what I believe we've -- I believe where we're headed.
Before I took office, there was a lot of folks out there -- a lot of folks out there making some pretty bold predictions about how things would turn out. You might remember some of the predictions. That if I became President, we'd, quote, ""see a depression the likes of which we've never seen."" End of quote.
Well, it's true that the economy was sputtering before I got here, adding only 60,000 jobs per month for the three months before I was sworn in. But now, six months later, we've changed that.
We've gone from 60,000 jobs per month to 60,000 jobs every three days -- more than 600,000 jobs per month since I took office. More than 3 million new jobs all told. That's the fastest growth, I'm told, at this point in any administration's history.
Another prediction -- that is my favorite one, I must add -- is that if I got elected, I'd bring the end to capitalism. (Laughs.) I never understood that one, but we've heard -- we've heard it an awful lot. Well, in six months into my administration, the U.S. economy has experienced the highest economic growth rate in nearly 40 years.
And we know we've -- and now we knew that we needed to launch a war-time effort to get the -- America vaccinated and pass a powerful American Rescue Plan.
We did both those things. And now, the forecasters have doubled their projections for growth this year in the economy to 7 percent or higher. In fact, the U.S. is the only developed country in the world where growth projections today are stronger than they were before the pandemic hit.
At the same time, companies across the country are giving workers a raise. Unusual thing. (Laughs.) And the number of new unemployment claims has been cut by more than half since I took office.
And by the way, two weeks ago, I issued a major executive order promoting fair and open competition, which is the cornerstone -- the cornerstone of American capitalism, banning non-compete clauses that suppress workers' wages; lowering the price of things like hearing aids, prescription drugs, Internet service; along with dozens of other actions.
Folks, it turns out capitalism is alive and very well. We're making serious progress to ensure that it works the way it's supposed to work: for the good of the American people.
So, for all those predictions of doom and gloom, six months in, here's where we stand: record growth, record job creation, workers getting hard-earned breaks.
Look, we've brought this economy back from the brink. And we designed our strategy not only to provide for a temporary boost, but to lay the foundation for a long-term boom that brings everyone along.
You know, that's why we designed the American Rescue Plan to help not just all those -- everyone at once, but over the course of a full year and beyond so we could help families and small businesses weather the ups and downs of our -- as the economy recovers from an historic pandemic. And I -- there are going to be ups and downs.
We saw a great example of that just last week. For the first time, monthly payments began going out to nearly every working family raising a child in the United States of America. Thanks to the expanded Child Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan: $300 a month going out for each child under the age of six, and $250 for every child 6 through 17, every month for the next six months, with more coming in the spring.
That money is a game-changer. For some, it's a lifesaver. Think of the single mom, struggling to put food on the table each month. The parent who has to tell their kid, ""I'm sorry, honey, but we can't afford those dance classes or the sports team you want to play on this fall. We can't do it."" You know, they can't wait for the credit against their taxes to be coming next year as a tax credit. They need cash in their pockets today.
For families with the least, this money will do the most -- dramatically reducing child poverty in America. And for millions of middle-class families, it will give them a little bit of breathing room every month. That's just one example of how we're building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
But despite that progress, we cannot afford to be complacent. We know that our economic recovery hinges on getting the pandemic under control.
You know, and by fully vaccinating 160 million Americans, 80 percent of our seniors, we've fundamentally changed the course of the pandemic -- from one that threatens all Americans, to a disease that has the most severe impacts only on the unvaccinated people in the country. But we can't let up, especially since and because of the Delta variant, which is more transmis- -- more transmissible and more dangerous.
Unfortunately, cases are now rising, particularly in communities with very low vaccination rates. Just four states account for nearly 40 percent -- four states, 40 percent of all cases last week. Virtually all hospitalizations and deaths are occurring among unvaccinated Americans. These tragedies are avoidable.
The data couldn't be clearer: If you're fully vaccinated, you have a high degree of protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. If you're unvaccinated, you are not protected. So, please, please get vaccinated. Get vaccinated now. It works. It's safe. It's free. It's convenient.
You know, this virus doesn't have to hold you back any longer. It doesn't have to hold our economy back any longer. But the only way we put it behind us is if more Americans get vaccinated.
We also know that as our economy has come roaring back, we've seen some price increases. Some folks have raised worries that this could be a sign of persistent inflation. But that's not our view. Our experts believe and the data shows that most of the price increases we've seen are -- were expected and expected to be temporary.
The reality is, you can't flip the global economic light back on and not expect this to happen. As demand returns, there's going to be global supply chain challenges. We've seen that in semi-conductors, which are used in automobiles. That global shortage has slowed vehicle production, creating a temporary spike in car prices. That's a real challenge. And my administration is doing everything we can to address it. But again, these disruptions are temporary.
Lumber prices are another example. They spiked early in our recovery, but in recent weeks, they've began to fall -- they've fallen by more than 50 percent.
In the hospitality industry, prices are returning to where they used to be. Economists call all of these things ""transitory effects."" And they account for about 60 percent of the price increases we've seen over the last few months.
Now, I want to be clear: My administration understands that if we were to ever experience unchecked inflation over the long term that would pose real challenges to our economy. So while we're confident that isn't what we are seeing today, we're going to remain vigilant about any response that is needed.
As I made clear to Chairman Powell of the Federal Reserve when we met recently, the Fed is independent. It should take whatever steps it deems necessary to support a strong, durable economic recovery. But whatever different views some might have on current price increases, we should be united on one thing: passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, which we shook hands on. We shook hands on it. And my Build Back Better plan will be a force for achieving lower prices for Americans looking ahead. It's another reason why these investments are so important.
If we make a prudent, multi-year investments in better roads, bridges, transit systems, and high-speed Internet, and a modern, resilient electric grid, here's what will happen: It breaks up the bottlenecks in our economy. Goods get to consumers more rapidly and less expensively. Small businesses create and innovate much more seamlessly. If we increase the availability of quality, affordable childcare, eldercare, paid leave, more people will enter the workforce.
These steps will enhance our productivity -- raising wages without raising prices. That won't increase inflation. It will take the pressure off of inflation, give a boost to our workforce, which leads to lower prices in the years ahead.
So, if your primary concern right now is inflation, you should be even more enthusiastic about this plan. And as we promote -- as we promote fair competition in our economy through the executive order I mentioned, it will drive down prices even further. New businesses will get in the game, competing against those giant corporations who have been free to ramp up prices because they haven't had any real competition.
Look, the bottom line is this: What the best companies do and what we as a country should do is make smart, sustainable investments with appropriate financing to make this nation more productive, to advance America's leadership on clean energy to win the jobs of the future while meeting the threat of climate change, and to ensure that all working Americans benefit from the growth they're helping produce.
The independent experts who have analyzed my plans have found that they would do just that: expand output and enable millions of Americans to enter the labor workforce now, just this year -- not just for the next -- but not just this year, but for decades in the future. It's not temporary.
This is the best strategy to create millions of jobs and lift up the middle-class families and grow wages and keep prices affordable for the long term.
What we can't do is go back to the same old trickle-down theories that gave us nearly $2 trillion in deficit-financed corporate tax giveaways that did nothing to make our economy more productive or resilient. The same people who cheered on that approach are now telling us it isn't [is] a problem if big companies have actually to compete for workers and offer them a fair wage with some dignity.
I could not disagree more. We can't go back to the old, failed thinking. We need to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, as I've said before.
The investments I'm proposing are investments the American people want and investments that our country needs. And if we get this done, a wide range of independent forecasters project that it will have an incredibly significant impact on GDP and jobs -- good-paying jobs with prevailing wages. And the majority of these jobs will go to people without a college degree.
I've said it before, and it's true: This is a blue-collar blueprint for building an American economy back. Simply put, we can't afford not to make these investments. And we're going to pay for them responsibly as well, by ensuring that our largest corporations and the very wealthiest among us pay their fair share by reforming our international tax system with a minimum global tax, which we've led the world to agree to.
Let me close with this: When I arrived in office, it had been a long time since the government had worked for the people. Things had been great for big corporations and folks at the top. Those 55 major corporations that paid zero in income tax while making billions in profits, they had no complaints.
But when I took office, I made a commitment -- a commitment to the American people that we were going to change that paradigm so working families could have a fighting chance again to get a good education; to get a good job and a raise; to take care of the elderly parent or the child with the disability and still be able to go out and earn a good living; to stop losing hours of their lives stuck in traffic because the streets are crumbling; or waiting for slow, spotty Internet to connect them to the world.
That's what the economy we're building is all about. That's why we passed the American Rescue Plan. And that's why we need the investment of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and my Build Back Better plan.
Our economy has come a long way over the last six months. We can't slow down now. We can make this boom we're experiencing today one that will ensure that all Americans have an opportunity to share in it for years to come. And we can show the world that American democracy can deliver for the people.
I look forward to continuing to build this economy. And I'm incredibly optimistic about what we're going to be able to build together in the next six months and the years to come.
Thank you all for listening. May God bless you. And I'll take a few questions.
Q: Mr. President, you said last week that companies and platforms like Facebook are ""killing people"" by letting them --
THE PRESIDENT: Let me (inaudible) precisely what I said. I'm glad you asked me that question. One, I had just read that -- on the Facebook -- Facebook pointed out that -- it was pointed out that Facebook, of all the misinformation, 60 percent of that misinformation came from 12 individuals. That's what the article said.
So, I was asked that question about what do I think is happening. Facebook isn't killing people; these 12 people who are out there giving misinformation -- anyone listening to it is getting hurt by it. It's killing people. It's bad information.
My hope is that Facebook, instead of taking it personally -- that somehow I'm saying Facebook is killing people -- that they would do something about the misinformation -- the outrageous informa- -- misinformation about the vaccine. That's what I meant.
Q: Have they done enough in your opinion to stop --
THE PRESIDENT: I haven't -- to be completely honest with you, I don't know that they did anything today. Up to -- over the weekend, I don't think they had. But I don't know. I don't know the answer to that question.
Q: Will you hold them accountable if they don't do more to stop the spread?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm -- when you say ""hold accountable,"" I just want to -- I'm not trying to hold people account- -- I'm trying make people to look at themselves. Look in the mirror. Think about that misinformation going to your son, your daughter, your relatives, someone you love. That's what I'm asking.
All the way in the back.
Q: Yes, thank you, Mr. President. At what point would you consider inflation unchecked to a point at which you would either consider taking action or you would want to see the Fed take action?
And secondly, why do you believe that the budget bill is appropriate legislation for a pathway to citizenship?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I think we need to find pathways to citizenship. The budget bill is an appropriate way to get around the filibuster to be able to make a judgment as to whether or not they should have a pathway. That's for the Parli- -- Parliamentarian to decide, though -- not for Joe Biden to decide.
Your first ques- -- part of the question was?
Q: It was on inflation. You mentioned unchecked inflation.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. There's nobody suggesting there's unchecked inflation on the way -- no serious economist. That's totally different.
I mean, look, the stock market is higher than it has been in all of history, even went down this month -- even down this month.
Now, I don't look at the stock market as a means by which to judge the economy like my predecessor did. But he'd be very -- he'd be talking to you every day for the last five months about how the stock market is so high -- higher than any time in history, still higher than any time in history.
So, that's not how I judge whether or not we have economic growth.
Q: Mr. President, on China and cyber hacking --
THE PRESIDENT: She jumps up before you do. (Laughter.)
Q: Effectively, your administration is naming and shaming China, but no sanctions. Why? And is that effective enough?
THE PRESIDENT: They're still determining exactly what happened. The investigation is not finished.
Thank you all very much.
Q: On China real quick -- on China real quick: What is your understanding of the biggest difference between what they've done versus what Russia has done in terms of cyber hacking?
THE PRESIDENT: That'd take a longer explanation.
Q: We have all the time in the world. What is it?
THE PRESIDENT: No, we don't. I have to go see the King of Jordan.
Look, to the best of my knowledge -- and I'm getting a report tomorrow morning on this, a detailed report -- my understanding is that the Chinese government, not unlike the Russian government, is not doing this themselves, but are protecting those who are doing it and maybe even accommodating them being able to do it. That may be the difference.
Thank you.
Q: Should the Olympics go forward, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: They are.",NA,"Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on the Economy and an Exchange with Reporters Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/336953 ",,,,,,,,,,,
15-Jul-21,Remarks on Child Tax Credit Relief Payments,"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Well, for you -- anybody under the age of 13 -- this has got to be boring, boring, boring for you. (Laughter.) Right? Well, I'll tell you what, we have to work something out here so that when this is over, your parents, your uncles, your aunts -- whoever you're with -- they owe you some ice cream or something for this. You know? (Laughter.)
Folks, it's a pleasure to be here. I'm going to take a sip here. (Drinks water.) And this -- I believe this is actually a historic day -- a historic day in the sense that we continue to build an economy that respects and recognizes the dignity of working-class families and middle-class families. It's historic and it's our effort to make another giant step toward ending child poverty in America. I think this will be one of the things that the Vice President and I will be most proud of when our terms are up.
Beginning this morning, nearly all working families -- that is people making under $150,000 as families or an individual making under $120,000 -- $125,000 who have children, are raising children in America, they're going to receive their first monthly -- first monthly tax cut payment. That payment -- that payment from the expanded Child Tax Credit that we signed into law as part of my -- our American Rescue Plan.
It's one of the largest-ever single tax cuts for families with children, and it's a reflection of our belief that the people of this country who need a tax cut aren't the folks at the top. They've got plenty of tax cuts. They're doing just fine. But it's the people in the middle, the folks who are struggling, who are just looking for a little bit of -- my dad would say, ""a little bit of breathing room."" A little bit of breathing room.
This has the potential to reduce child poverty in the same way that the Social Security reduced poverty for the elderly. And by the way, you think of monthly payments -- you get a Social Security check -- those who you know get Social Security, they get it monthly. Well, this will be -- unless you want it in one lump sum, this would be a monthly payment for childcare -- for -- excuse me, for your children, a tax cut.
And here's how the tax credit works: For every child under the age of six, a parent will get $3,600 a year. For every child 6 to 17, they'll get $3,000 per year. For example, a middle-class family with two young children would expect to receive $7,200 a year to help raise their children. This will be the -- they'll get the first half of this $3,600 starting today. Today. Today. And it'll be paid out at $600 a month between now, July, and December. And then they're going to get the rest of the payment next spring around Tax Day.
Now, if you file taxes electronically, you can go to your bank account today -- today -- and you'll see a payment that says ""Child CTC."" Let me say that again: payments of $300 for each child under the age of 6, $250 for each child between the ages of 6 and 17 on a monthly basis between now -- between July and December.
If you don't file electronic- -- your taxes electronically, as you did last year, you can expect to receive a check in the mail beginning today or a few days from now. And you'll get this payment on the 15th of every month for the rest of this year.
And if you're not required to file taxes at all in the past -- you haven't filed because you didn't owe any taxes, then you can go to: ChildTaxCredit.gov. Let me say it again: ChildTaxCredit.gov. And you will give you -- they'll give you clear information and a link to help you sign up for the first time. This can be lifechanging for so many families.
Because of the way the tax credit was structured before the American Rescue Plan, more than 26 million children from the hardest-pressed working families didn't get any full payment for the Child Credit -- for childcare -- for Child Tax Credit. Half of all Black and Hispanic children in America never received the full tax credit. We've changed all that.
In technical terms, we've made this tax cut fully refundable. In plain English, it means instead of families who need help the most getting the le- -- getting the least, the hard-working -- the hard-working families will get this on a month- -- full monthly basis.
Ninety-seven percent of the children receiving this credit come from working families. And the other 3 percent includes kids being raised by retired grandparents or by someone with a serious disability.
And by the way, this credit doesn't start to phase out until a couple is making $150,000 or a single parent is making $112,000 [$112,500]. It begins to phase out then. This is a middle-class tax cut. When I came up -- when I decided I wanted this in the legislation, I referred to it in the way it really is: It's a middle-class tax cut. It's just like the wealthy get tax cuts for a lot of things, this is a tax cut for your children -- having children.
And this can make it possible for a hardworking parent to say to his or her child, ""Honey, we get -- you can get your new braces now. We can get you a tutor to help you in that math class you're having trouble with. We can get you the sports equipment you need to sign up to -- for your first team you're going to play on.""
People have written me to tell me they'll use the money to buy their kids new shoes, to send them to summer camp, to cover afterschool care when school starts up again.
You know -- and to give you a sense of how transformative this is: This would be the largest-ever one-year decrease in child poverty in the history of the United States of America -- as we begin now. Historic reductions in child poverty among white, Black, and Latinos, and AAPI communities. It's not even close. The benefits will be felt for years.
Studies have shown -- (a baby cries) -- that tax relief that helps children -- that's okay, don't worry about it. It's okay to let him cry, or her, whichever -- that helps children and can lead to better health, better school performance, and better future earnings.
In fact, research from Columbia University in New York found that for each dollar this tax cut costs, it returns eight dollars in benefit down the line. Eight dollars would have to be spent other ways. It's a gigantic help. It's an eight to one return.
Your head, your heart, and your budget all lead to the same place. This is the right thing to do, and it's the smart thing to do.
Today, these tax cut payments are arriving automatically. But it didn't happen automatically -- the result of the work that people who did this, advocating for this for a long, long time. And we finally got it passed in my American Rescue Plan.
I want to particularly thank those who have been fighting for this for years: Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro from Connecticut. She has been a champion for this issue. Congressman Richie Neal and -- and Torres. And Senators Bennet, Brown, and Booker. And Ron Wyden.
You'll probably hear from our Republican friends -- all who voted against this -- but they'll tout the success as it helps working families in their states and their districts. But in the coming days, we're also going to hear from them saying, ""I want to now extend this tax…"" It's only for one year now.
It's all I could get it for, for the first time. And so, I want to extend it into the future now. I have another piece of legislation that will be voted on soon, saying we're going to continue this.
To the people who say we can't afford to give the middle class a break, I say: We can afford it by making people at the top and the big corporations -- over 50 of which paid no taxes last year at all -- to finally just -- just start paying their fair share. I'm not going to gouge them. Just pay their fair share. Because people who are working hard and paying taxes deserve a break.
That's why -- excuse me for all these terms I'm using, but my Build Back Better agenda, which still needs to be voted on in the Congress, keeps this tax cut for working families in place for years to come. We shouldn't let taxes go up on working families. We shouldn't let child poverty continue to stain the conscience or drag down our economy.
And so, I say to my colleagues in Congress: This tax cut for working families is something we should extend, not end, next year.
And I say to all of you watching: Make sure your family, friends, and community know about this tax cut. Send to them, as I said, ChildTaxCredit.gov to learn more about the difference this is going to make in their lives.
Let me close with this: I signed the American Rescue Plan less than two months after taking office on January 20th. Four months later, we've implemented the fir- -- we've implemented the first-ever automatic monthly payment for any major tax credit ever, as the Vice President was talking about, beyond Social Security, which was a long time ago.
This groundbreaking effort is similar to what we did in our -- what I called our ""war-time effort"" to vaccinate Americans against COVID-19, to mobilize the whole country.
We're proving -- we're proving that democracy can deliver for people, and deliver in a timely way -- saving lives, improving lives, helping fuel a recordsetting recovery, giving working families a fighting chance again.
I received an email today from a mother in Washington State. She's a young teacher who had just received her payment. She wrote, and I'm quoting, ""My family has been living hand to mouth to put me through school so I can follow my passion of molding young minds… This first CTC payment has come at the exact moment when we need it most. These payments may seem small to some, but they are lifechanging for my family, for us.""
Millions of children and their families -- starting today, their lives are about to change for the better. And our country will be better off for it as well.
This is a really good day. And parents are going to be able to tell your kids when they're 25-years-old that you were there the day this happened; we talked about it. We are showing once again that there's nothing beyond the capacity -- our capacity as Americans to get done when we do it together.
So, I want to thank you. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. And kids, thank you for being so polite while I was speaking. You're very, very nice. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
See you all. Bye bye. (Applause.)",NA,"Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on Child Tax Credit Relief Payments Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/336965 ",,,,,,,,,,,
14-Jul-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting with Governors and Mayors to Discuss Infrastructure and an Exchange with Reporters,"THE PRESIDENT: Well, we're going to talk about infrastructure and how we're going to have to widen this room so you all can get in. (Laughter.)
I want to thank you for being here, all of you, to discuss an issue that has been always bipartisan for the longest time. When I got here 180 years ago, it was a bipartisan issue.
Mayors and governors more than anyone else knows what it means to be accountable to people, and you have to solve problems every single day in your communities. And -- and there's no -- there are no Democratic roads or Republican bridges.
But -- you know, but there are families in need of shorter commute times, safer commutes; kids that need to be able to drink clean drinking water that doesn't have lead in it; and communities need to have reliable transit systems.
And we have a chance to solve these problems -- a bipartisan chance to solve these problems. It would create millions of jobs, literally -- not -- not $7-an-hour jobs or even $15-an-hour jobs, but jobs of prevailing wages, making $46, $50 an hour with benefits. And, you know, a chance for America to put ourselves in a position where we can begin to win the second quarter of the 21st century, because our infrastructure, relative to the rest of the world, is moving -- we're falling behind.
I found it disturbing to find out that they ask if you name -- I think it was the 25 best airports in the world --
MR. DEESE: Yes, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: -- the United States wasn't mentioned. There wasn't a single U.S. entry.
So -- but fixing the broken today is okay, but we got to build for tomorrow. There's a lot we're going to do. And press is tired of hearing me say this because I've been talking about infrastructure for a while now. Hopefully, it won't be like the last team in here -- once a week and not get anything done.
But we're going to get something done. And that's why I think that my Build Back Better agenda is all about not just building back, but build back better than what we -- what we inherited.
And Mayors and Governors, you know how to get this done and what we have to do. It's time to stop talking about it and time to get you the resources. But what I want to talk about today is what you need most and what you think will work the best.
And so that's what we're going to be talking about and -- and hopefully, we're going to get a lot done.
So, thank you all for coming in.
Q: Do you need to do more work on the payfors, Mr. President? Are the payfors intact?
THE PRESIDENT: He's talking about -- I went up and spoke to the -- the -- Democratic caucus today, and we put together a plan that dealt with infrastructure. And it's a bipartisan plan. I think we're in good shape. There may be some slight adjustments to the -- of the payfors. And that's going to get down to what the -- what the Congress wants to do.
I've laid out how I think we'd pay for it. And we have an agreement. We have an agreement. There may be slight changes; I'm not sure what may happen, exactly how -- but it's going to be paid for. And that's what we're going to do.
So, thank you all very much.
Q: Mr. President, any concern that having two tracks here will disrupt the bipartisan agreement that was worked out?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I think it's the only way to get it done is having two tracks.

13-Jul-21,"Remarks on Voting Rights at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) I see an awful lot of good friends out there. Please have a seat if you have one.
I -- let me begin by saying I used to be important. (Laughter.) I used to be the chairman of the board of this place. And Jeffrey Rosen allowed me to do that for a while.
But thank you all for being here. I truly appreciate it. Governor, it's above and beyond the call. Mr. Mayor, I'd compli- -- I thought you were a great mayor -- still think you are -- but your judgment in fiancées is even stronger. And -- but -- but all of you. And a good friend, Bobby Brady. I see so many friends out. Al Sharpton -- Al, how are you, pal? It's great to see you. (Applause.)
And I'm -- I'm going to get in trouble here because I'm going to recognize my congresswoman from the state of Delaware, Lisa Blunt Rochester -- (applause) -- and her sister who used to run my office. Stand up. (Applause.)
Well, folks, good afternoon. There's a serious subject I'd like to talk about today. I'm here in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center -- the city and the place where the story of ""We the People"" -- ""We the People"" began.
It's a story that's neither simple nor straightforward. That's because the story is the sum of our parts, and all those parts are fundamentally human. And being human is to be imperfect, driven by appetite and ambition as much as by goodness and grace.
But some things in America should be simple and straightforward.
Perhaps the most important of those things -- the most fundamental of those things -- is the right to vote. The right to vote freely. (Applause) The right to vote freely, the right -- the right to vote fairly, the right to have your vote counted. The democratic threshold is liberty. With it, anything is possible. Without it, nothing -- nothing.
And for our democracy and the work -- and to deliver our work and [for] our people, it's up to all of us to protect that right. This is a test of our time and what I'm here to talk about today.
Just think about the past election.
A 102-year-old woman in Arkansas who voted for the first time on the very spot she once picked cotton.
A 94-year-old woman in Michigan who voted early and in person in her seventy-se- -- 72nd consecutive election. You know what she said? She said this election was, quote, ""the most important vote that we ever had.""
The daughter who voted in the memory of her dad who died of COVID-19 so others wouldn't have the experience of pain and darkness and loss that she was going through. Patients out there.
And the parents -- the parents who voted for school their children will learn in.
Sons and daughters voted for the planet they're going to live on.
Young people just turning 18 and everyone who, for the first time in their lives, thought they could truly make a difference.
America -- America and Americans of every background voted. They voted for good jobs and higher wages. They voted for racial equity and justice. They voted to make healthcare a right, not a privilege.
And the reason that Americans went to vote and the lengths they went to vote -- to be able to vote in this past election were absolutely extraordinary. In fact, the fact that so many election officials across the country made it easier and safer for them to be able to vote in the middle of a pandemic was remarkable.
As a result, in 2020, more people voted in America than ever -- ever in the history of America, in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. (Applause.)
All told, more than 150 [million] Americans of every age, of every race, of every background exercised their right to vote.
They voted early. They voted absentee. They voted in person. They voted by mail. They voted by drop box. And then they got their families and friends to go out and vote.
Election officials, the entire electoral system, withstood unrelenting political attacks, physical threats, intimidation, and pressure. They did so with unyielding courage and
faith in our democracy.
With recount after recount after recount, court case after court case, the 2020 election was the most scrutinized election ever in American history. Challenge after challenge brought to local, state, and election officials; state legislatures; state and federal courts -- even to the United States Supreme Court not once, but twice.
More than 80 judges, including those appointed by my predecessor, heard the arguments. In every case, neither cause nor evidence was found to undermine the national achievement of administering this historic election in the face of such extraordinary challenges.
Audits, recounts were conducted in Arizona, in Wisconsin. In Georgia, it was recounted three times.
It's clear. For those who challenge the results and question the integrity of the election: No other election has ever been held under such scrutiny and such high standards.
The Big Lie is just that: a big lie. (Applause.)
The 2020 election -- it's not hyperbole to suggest -- the most examined and the fullest expression of the will of the people in the history of this nation. This should be celebrated -- the example of America at its best. But instead, we continue to see an example of human nature at its worst -- something darker and more sinister.
In America, if you lose, you accept the results. You follow the Constitution. You try again. You don't call facts ""fake"" and then try to bring down the American experiment just because you're unhappy. That's not statesmanship. (Applause.)
That's not statesmanship; that's selfishness. That's not democracy; it's the denial of the right to vote. It suppresses. It subjugates.
The denial of full and free and fair elections is the most un-American thing that any of us can imagine, the most undemocratic, the most unpatriotic, and yet, sadly, not unprecedented.
From denying enslaved people fu- -- full citizenship until the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments after the Civil War; to denying women the right to vote until the 19th Amendment 100 years ago; to poll taxes and literacy tests, and the Ku Klux Klan campaigns of violence and terror that lasted into the '50s and '60s; to the Supreme Court decision in 2013 and then again just two weeks ago –- a decision that weakened the landmark Voting Rights Act; to the willful attacks -- election attacks in 2020; and then to a whole other level of threat -- the violence and the deadly insurrection on the Capitol on January 6th.
I just got back from Europe, speaking to the G7 and to NATO. They wonder -- not a joke -- they wonder, Gov -- they ask me, ""Is it going to be okay?"" The citadel of democracy in the world, ""Is it o- -- going to be okay?""
Time and again, we've weathered threats to the right to vote in free and fair elections. And each time, we found a way to overcome. And that's what we must do today.
Vice President Harris and I have spent our careers doing this work. And I've asked her to lead, to bring people together to protect the right to vote and our democracy. And it starts with continuing the fight to pass H.R.1, the For the People Act. (Applause.)
That bill -- that bill would help end voter suppression in the states, get dark money out of politics, give voice to the people at the grassroots level, create a fairer district maps, and end partisan political gerrymandering.
Last month, Republicans opposed even debating, even considering For the People Act. Senate Democrats stood united to protect our democracy and the sanctity of the vote. We must pass the For the People Act. It's a national imperative.
We must also fight for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore and expand -- (applause) -- to restore and expand voting protections and prevent voter suppression. All the congresswomen and men here -- there's a bunch of you -- you knew John, many of you.
Just weeks ago, the Supreme Court yet again weakened the Voting Rights Act and upheld what Justice Kagan called, quote, ""a significant race-based disparity in voting opportunities.""
The Court's decision, as harmful as is, does not limit the -- Congress' ability to repair the damage done. That's the important point. It puts the burden back on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act to its intended strength.
As soon as Congress passes the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, I will sign it and let the whole world see it. (Applause.) That will be an important moment.
And the world is wondering -- the world is wondering -- and Dwight knows what I'm talking about, for real. You know, the world is wondering, ""What is America going to do?""
But we also have to clear-eyed about the obstruction we face. Legislation is one tool, but not the only tool. And it's not the only measure of our obligation to defend democracy today.
For example, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the United States Department of Justice is going to be using its authorities to challenge the onslaught of state laws undermining voting rights in old and new ways. (Applause.)
The focus -- the focus will be on dismantling racially discriminatory laws, like the recent challenge to Georgia's vicious anti-voting law.
The Department of Justice will do so with a voting rights division that -- at my request -- is doubling its size in enforcement staff. (Applause)
Civil rights groups -- civil rights groups and other organizations have announced their plans to stay vigilant and challenge these odious laws in the courts.
In Texas, for example, Republican-led state legislature wants to allow partisan poll watchers to intimidate voters and imperil impartial poll workers. They want voters to dive [drive] farther and be able to be in a position where they wonder who's watching them and intimidating them; to wait longer to vote. To drive a hell of lot lo- -- excuse me -- a long way -- (laughter) -- to get to vote. They want to make it so hard and inconvenient that they hope people don't vote at all. That's what this is about.
This year alone, 17 states have enacted -- not just proposed, but enacted -- 28 new laws to make it harder for Americans to vote, not to mention -- and catch this -- nearly 400 additional bills Republican members of the state legislatures are trying to pass.
The 21st century Jim Crow assault is real. It's unrelenting, and we're going to challenge it vigorously.
While -- (applause) -- while this broad assault against voting rights is not unprecedented, it's taking on a new and, literally, pernicious forms.
It's no longer just about who gets to vote or making it easier for eligible voters to vote. It's about who gets to count the vote -- who gets to count whether or not your vote counted at all. It's about moving from independent election administrators who work for the people to polarized state legislatures and partisan actors who work for political parties.
To me, this is simple: This is election subversion. It's the most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free and fair elections in our history. Never before have they decided who gets to count -- count -- what votes count.
Some -- some legi- -- state legislatures want to make it harder for you to vote. And if you vote, they want to be able to tell you your vote doesn't count for any reason they make up.
They want the ability to reject the final count and ignore the will of the people if their preferred candidate loses.
And they're trying -- not only targeting people of color, they're targeting voters of all races and backgrounds. It's with a simple target: who did not vote for them. That's the target.
It's unconscionable. I mean, really, I -- it's hard to -- it's hard to declare just how critical this is. It's simply unconscionable.
We've got to shore up our election system and address the threats of election subversion, not just from abroad -- which I spent time with Putin talking about -- but from home. From home.
We must ask those who represent us at the federal, state, and local levels: Will you deny the will of the people? Will you ignore their voices?
We have to ask: Are you on the side of truth or lies; fact or fiction; justice or injustice; democracy or autocracy? That's what it's coming down to.
Which brings me to perhaps the most important thing we have to do: We have to for- -- forge a coalition of Americans of every background and political party -- the advocates, the students, the faith leaders, the labor leaders, the business executives -- and raise the urgency of this moment.
Because as much as people know they're screwing around with the election process, I don't think that most people think this is about who gets to count what vote counts -- literally, not figuratively. You vote for certain electors to vote for somebody for President. State legislator comes along -- under their proposal -- and they say, ""No, we don't like those electors. We're going to appoint other electors who are going to vote for the other guy or other woman.""
Because here's the deal: In 2020, democracy was put to a test -- first by the pandemic; then by a desperate attempt to deny the reality and the results of the election; and then by a violent and deadly insurrection on the Capitol, the citadel of our democracy.
I've been around a long time in public life. I thought I've seen it all or most of it all. But I never thought I'd see that, for real.
And in spite of what you see on television -- and you saw it -- you have senators saying it was just a day at the Capitol, just people visiting the Capitol.
Folks -- but we met the test. Because of the extraordinary courage of election officials -- many of them Republicans; our court system; and those brave Capitol police officers -- because of them, democracy held.
Look how close it came. I mean, for real, how close it came. We're going to face another test in 2022: a new wave of unprecedented voter suppression, and raw and sustained election subversion. We have to prepare now.
As I've said time and again: No matter what, you can never stop the American people from voting. They will decide, and the power must always be with the people.
That's why, just like we did in 2020, we have to prepare for 2022. We'll engage in an all-out effort to educate voters about the changing laws, register them to vote, and then get the vote out.
We'll encourage people to run for office themselves at every level.
We will be asking my Republican friends -- in Congress, in states, in cities, in counties -- to stand up, for God's sake, and help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our elections and the sacred right to vote. (Applause.) Have you no shame? (Applause.)
Whether it's stopping foreign interference in our elections or the spread of disinformation from within, we have to work together.
Vice President Harris and I will be making it clear that there's real peril in making raw power, rather than the idea of liberty, the centerpiece of the common life.
The Founders understood this. The women of Seneca Falls understood this. The brave, heroic foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement understood this. So must we.
This isn't about Democrats and Republicans; it's literally about who we are as Americans. It's that basic. It's about the kind of country we want today, the kind of country we want for our children and grandchildren tomorrow. And quite frankly, the whole world is watching. Folks -- (applause).
I'm not being sentimental. I'm not preaching to you. I'm just giving it to you straight, as I promised I would always do -- lay things out on the line and honor your trust with trust [truth].
So hear me clearly: There is an unfolding assault taking place in America today -- an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections, an assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are -- who we are as Americans.
For, make no mistake, bullies and merchants of fear and peddlers of lies are threatening the very foundation of our country.
It gives me no pleasure to say this. I never thought in my entire career I'd ever have to say it. But I swore an oath to you, to God -- to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. And that's an oath that forms a sacred trust to defend America against all threats both foreign and domestic. (Applause.)
The assault on free and fair elections is just such a threat, literally. I've said it before: We're are facing the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War. That's not hyperbole. Since the Civil War. The Confederates back then never breached the Capitol as insurrectionists did on January the 6th.
I'm not saying this to alarm you; I'm saying this because you should be alarmed.
I'm also saying this: There's good news. It doesn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be, for real. We have the means. We just need to show the will -- the will to save and strengthen our democracy.
We did it in 20- -- we did it in the 2020. The battle for the soul of America -- in that battle, the people voted. Democracy prevailed. Our Constitution held. We have to do it again.
My fellow Americans, it requires fair-mindedness; devotion to justice; corny as it sounds, a love of country. It requires us to unite in common purpose, to declare here and now: We, the people, will never give up. (Applause.) We will not give in. We will overcome. We will do it together. And guaranteeing the right to vote, ensuring every vote is counted has always been the most patriotic thing we can do. (Applause.)
Just remember, our late friend John Lewis said, ""Freedom is not a state; it is an act."" ""Freedom is not a state; it is an act."" And we must act, and we will act. For our cause is just, our vision is clear, and our hearts are full. (Applause.)
For ""We the People,"" for our democracy, for America itself, we must act. (Applause.)
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops and all those stand watch over our democracy. (Applause.) But act. We've got to act. Thank you. (Applause.)",NA,"Joseph R.

12-Jul-21,Remarks on Efforts to Reduce Gun Crimes and an Exchange with Reporters,"THE PRESIDENT: Folks, I want to start by recognizing the remarkable protests that are taking place in Cuba, with the Cuban people demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime. And I don't think we've seen anything like this protest in a long, long time -- if, quite frankly, ever.
The United States stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights. And we call on the government -- the government of Cuba to refrain from violence or attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba.
And we're also closely following the developments in Haiti in the wake of the horrific assassination of the President that recently took place. The people of Haiti deserve peace and security, and Haiti's political leaders need to come together for the good of their country.
Over the weekend, I dispatched a high-level, expert delegation to assess the situation and to determine where the United States can offer our support.
And finally, as a close neighbor and friend of the people of both Cuba and Haiti, the United States stands ready to continue to provide assistance, and I'll have more for you as we move on.
But the purpose of the meeting today is we've convened a group of law enforcement and other community leaders, including mayors of the -- of our cities, one, to thank them for their service because we owe them big time; second, to hear directly from each of them about reducing violent crime and, particularly, gun violence in our communities.
Last month, I met with a similar group to unveil my comprehensive strategy to do just that. And it's been -- it's been an -- you know, I guess -- I look at the Attorney General -- we've been this a lo- -- at this a long time. A long time. It seems like most of my career I've been dealing with this issue.
While there's no ""one-size-fit-all"" approach, we know there are some things that work, and the first of those that work is stemming the flow of firearms used to commit violent crimes. And we've talked -- you and I have talked about this, Mayor, before.
MAYOR BOWSER: Mm-hmm. Absolutely.
THE PRESIDENT: And it includes cracking down on holding rogue gun dealers accountable for violating the federal law. It includes the Justice Department creating five new strike forces to crack down on illegal gun trafficking (inaudible) supplying weapons to cities of New York -- from New York to the Bay Area.
Secondly, it's supporting local law enforcement with the federal support they need. Our strategy provides including funding for law enforcement through the American Rescue Plan for states, cities, and to be able to hire police and pay them overtime in order to advance community policing.
Third, our plan invests in community violence and intervention. We -- what we want to do is when we -- we know we utilize trusted community members and encourage more community policing, we can intervene before the violence erupts -- at least that's what, I think, consensus and our experience. And community violence intervention programs have shown to reduce crime in some cities by up to 60 percent.
Fourthly, our strategy to fund the other vital services, like mental health and substance abuse disorder programs, job training, and summer job programs. And this is going to help prevent crime and support young people to pick up a paycheck instead of a pistol.
And fifth, our strategy helps formerly incarcerated people successfully reenter society with housing, jobs, and training, and other support that, up to now, have been denied to them. Somebody gets -- gets out of jail right now, after serving their time, they get a bus ticket and 25 bucks, and they end up under the same bridge they left. And we know this will help.
This will make us all safer. The American Rescue Plan funds programs to help get job training, apprenticeships, and work experience so they can gain stability and security and a chance for a better life.
There's a lot more to my strategy, but at -- that's at the core. It's about coordinating at a federal, state, and local level. That's what, ultimately, we're going to talk about today.
We recognize that we have to come together to fulfill the first responsibility of a democracy and to keep each other safe. And that's what the American people are looking for when it comes to reducing violent crime and gun violence.
And I think this group is illustrative of -- of what we need to get put together, and I want to thank them for being here. And I'm going to look forward to hearing from them because I'm going to be asking them what they think we should be doing on the federal level.
So, thank you very much. And we'll have more to say as we move on. Thank you.
Q: Mr. President, would you consider changing the embargo on Cuba? Would you consider making any changes to the embargo with Cuba?
Q: When you will be ready to change Trump's reversal on Cuba, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: We are going to have more to say about Cuba and Haiti as the week goes on and -- so stay tuned. Thank you.",NA,"Joseph R.

9-Jul-21,Remarks on Signing an Executive Order Promoting Competition in The American Economy and an Exchange with Reporters,"THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everyone. They have a Cabinet meeting. (Laughter.) Please -- please be seated. Thank you.
Well, it is not ""good morning,"" which my remarks say here, but -- (laughter) -- good afternoon. We're in the midst of a historic economic recovery. And because our successful vaccination program strategy has been working and the immediate relief through the American Rescue Plan has brought back our economy from the worst economic crisis in nearly a century, America is now on track. We're now on track for the highest economic growth in 40 years and among the highest growth records on record.
We designed our ecomi- -- our economic strategy to be durable through the ups and downs that come with recovery. And there are ups and downs.
That's why the American Rescue Plan was designed to help people not just all at once, but over the course of a full year so we could continue supporting families, small businesses, state and local budgets to help them weather those ups and downs.
And now that the economy is back on track, we're making progress on the second phase of our strategy: ensuring long-term growth.
That's what my Build Back Better agenda, including my Americans Family Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure agreement we reached last month -- that's what they're all about: long term.
But to keep our country moving, we have to take another step as well -- and I know you're all tired of hearing me during the campaign and since I'm elected President talk about it -- and that's bringing fair competition back to the economy.
That's why today I'm going to be signing shortly an executive order promoting competition to lower price -- to lower prices, to increase wages, and to take another critical step toward an economy that works for everybody.
The heart of American capitalism is a simple idea: open and fair competition -- that means that if your companies want to win your business, they have to go out and they have to up their game; better prices and services; new ideas and products.
That competition keeps the economy moving and keeps it growing. Fair competition is why capitalism has been the world's greatest force for prosperity and growth.
By the same token, ""competitive economy"" means companies must do all they do to do -- everything they do to compete for workers: offering higher wages, more flexible hours, better benefits.
But what we've seen over the past few decades is less competition and more concentration that holds our economy back. We see it in big agriculture, in big tech, in big pharma. The list goes on.
Rather than competing for consumers, they are consuming their competitors. Rather than competing for workers, they're finding ways to gain the upper hand on labor. And too often, the government has actually made it harder for new companies to break in and compete.
Look at what that means for family budgets. Take prescription drugs: Just a handful of companies control the market for many vital medicines, giving them leverage over everyone else to charge whatever they want. As a result, Americans pay two and a half times more for prescription drugs than in any other leading country. And nearly one in four Americans struggles to afford their medication.
Another example: hearing aids. Right now, if you need a hearing aid, you can't just walk into a pharmacy and pick one up over the counter. You have to get it from a doctor or a specialist. Not only does that make getting hearing aids inconvenient, it makes them considerably more expensive, and it makes it harder for new companies to compete, innovate, and sell hearing aids at lower prices.
As a result, a pair -- a pair of hea- -- a pair of hearing aids can cost thousands of dollars. That's a big reason why just one in seven Americans with hearing loss actually use a hearing aid.
Another example: Internet services. There are more than 65 million Americans who live in a place with only one high-speed Internet provider. Research shows, when you have unlimited Internet operation, you pay up to five times more on average than families in places with more choices. That's what a lack of competition does: it raises the prices you pay.
And it's not just consumers getting hurt. Big ag is putting a squeeze on farmers. Small and family farms, first-time farmers -- like veterans coming home and Black and Latino and Indigenous farmers -- they're seeing price hikes for seed, lopsided contracts, shrinking profits, and growing debt.
Lack of competition hurts workers as well. In many communities, there are only a handful of employers left competing for workers. Think of company towns across Appalachia and other parts of the country where one big corporation runs the show.
When corporations have that kind of leverage over workers, it pushes down aver- -- it pushes down advertised wages by up to 17 percent. And as competition decreases, businesses don't feel the pressure to innovate or invest in their workforce. That hurts working families and it hurts our economy.
All told, between rising prices and lowering wages, lack of competition costs the median American household $5,000 a year.
Now, look, I'm a proud capitalist. I spent most of my career representing the corporate state of Delaware. I know America can't succeed unless American business succeeds.
But let me be very clear: Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism; it's exploitation. Without healthy competition, big players can change and charge whatever they want and treat you however they want. And for too many Americans, that means accepting a bad deal for things that can't go -- you can't go without.
So, we know we've got a problem -- a major problem. But we also have an incredible opportunity. We can bring back more competition to more of the country, helping entrepreneurs and small businesses get in the game, helping workers get a better deal, helping families save money every month. The good news is: We've done it before.
In the early 1900s, President Teddy Roosevelt saw an economy dominated by giants like Standard Oil and JP Morgan's railroads. He took them on, and he won. And he gave the little guy a fighting chance.
Decades later, during the Great Depression, his cousin Franklin Roosevelt saw a wave of corporate mergers that wiped out sec- -- scores of small businesses, crushing competition and innovation. So he ramped up antitrust enforcement eightfold in just two years, saving families billions in today's dollars and helping to set the course for sustained economic growth after World War Two.
He also called for an economic bill of rights, including, quote, ""the right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies."" End of quote.
Between them, the two Roosevelts established an American tradition -- an antitrust tradition. It is how we ensure that our economy isn't about people working for capitalism; it's about capitalism working for people.
But, over time, we've lost the fundamental American idea that true capitalism depends on fair and open competition. Forty years ago, we chose the wrong path, in my view, following the misguided philosophy of people like Robert Bork, and pulled back on enforcing laws to promote competition.
We're now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power. And where- -- what have we gotten from it? Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses. Too many Americans who feel left behind. Too many people who are poorer than their parents.
I believe the experiment failed. We have to get back to an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out.
The executive order I'm soon going to be signing commits the federal government to full and aggressive enforcement of our antitrust laws. No more tolerance for abusive actions by monopolies. No more bad mergers that lead to mass layoffs, higher prices, fewer options for workers and consumers alike.
My executive order includes 72 specific actions. I expect the federal agencies -- and they know this -- to help restore competition so that we have lower prices, higher wages, more money, more options, and more convenience for the American people.
Today, I want to focus on three specific actions:
First, the FDA -- the Food and Drug Administration -- are going to work with states and Tribes to safely import prescription drugs from Canada. That's just one of many actions in the executive order that will lower prescription drug prices.
Second, the FDA is going to issue rules so that hearing aids can be sold over the counter. That's something the last administration was supposed to have done but didn't do. We're going to get it done. After these rules go into effect, a pair of hearing aids can cost hundreds of dollars, not thousands. And you'll be able to pick them up at your local drugstore.
Third, we're going to improve competition for workers. I've talked a lot about non-compete agreements -- contracts that say you can't take another job in your field, even if you get a better deal. I made a speech -- I was just reminiscing with my staff -- back in 2018, at the Brookings Institution, where I talked about the non-compete clauses that were just -- I found -- to be absolutely ridiculous, but how prevalent they were throughout industries.
At least one in three businesses require their workers to sign a non-compete agreement. These aren't just high-paid executives or scientists who hold secret formulas for Coca-Cola so Pepsi can't get their hands on it. A recent study found one in five workers without a college education is subject to non-compete agreements. They're construction workers, hotel workers, disproportionately women and women of color.
Think of the 26-year-old employee at a company. She's a star worker, but she isn't being treated right. She's underpaid, passed over for promotions. A competitor across the street knows and wants to bring her in at a higher wage, but she can't do it. Her company threatens legal action over a non-compete clause she had to sign in order to get hired in the first place. She can't afford a lawyer for help, so she's locked in.
Imagine if you're in her shoes. You'd feel powerless, disrespected, bullied, trapped. That's not right. Workers should be free to take a better job if someone offers it.
If your employer wants to keep you, he or she should have to make it worth your while to stay. That's the kind of competition that leads to better wages and greater dignity of work.
Look, I'm not going to go into it now, but I used to talk about, you know, there's non-compete clauses of people running the machines that lay down asphalt. If, in fact, you get offered a job and you have a -- you know, you're in Arkansas doing it, a lot of -- a specific example is you can't take a job in west Texas to do it. What in the hell does that have to do with anything? (Laughter.) No, I'm serious. Or there were clauses in McDonald's contracts: You can't leave Burger King to go to McDonald's. Come on. Is there a trade secret about what's inside that patty? (Laughter.) No, but I'm serious.
You all -- I don't know if you do know; I didn't know it until five years ago -- the incredible number of non-compete clauses for ordinary people who -- it was done for one reason: to keep wages low. Period.
Look, my executive order calls on the FTC to ban or limit non-compete agreements. Let workers chose who they want to work for.
I'm also calling on the FTC to do away with certain occupational licensing requirements. You realize, if you want to braid hair and you move from one state to another, sometimes you have to do a six-month apprenticeship, even though you've been in the business for a long, long time? What the hell -- what's that all about?
Military families, for example, they're often on the move between states with each new assignment. So you have a woman in the military, her husband is following her, or vice versa. Guess what? If you have -- if you're a plumber, you have to get a different license when you move from Delaware to Missouri.
Look, it can't be a significant burden to get a new license in a new home state. That burden can't be around anymore. It takes time and it takes money. It takes a toll on a family's income while you're waiting. We should remove that barrier, providing more mobility, more opportunity, higher wages for families on the move.
This is something that my wife, Jill, has worked on together with Michelle Obama through the Joining Forces initiative for the military.
We're going to keep that moving. We're going to get it done in an executive order.
Let me close with this: Competition works. We know it works. We've seen it works when it exists. Fair competition is was what made America the wealthiest, most innovative nation in history. That's why people come here to invent things and start new businesses.
In the competition against China and other nations of the 21st century, let's show that American democracy and the American people can truly outcompete anyone. Because I know that just given half a chance, the American people will never, ever, ever let their country down. Imagine if we give everyone a full and fair chance. That's what this is all about. That's what I'm about to do.
So I'd like to invite the Cabinet members up here. I'd like to -- and the Attorney General is here -- Attorney General Garland. Xavier -- Mr. Secretary, you can come up too. I've been watching on television; you've been really good. (Laughter.) Gina Raimondo. Also, Pete Buttigieg. And the chair of the FCC [FTC], Lian [sic] -- excuse me, Lina Khan, Acting Chair of the FTC. And Director of the National Economic Council.
Am I leaving anybody out? Anyway, come on up. This may be the first Cabinet meeting we've had.
Okay. ""Promoting Competition in the American Economy.""
First pen. (Laughter.) Second pen. Third. Fourth. (Laughter.) Fifth.
I'm wondering how Barack did this with a shorter name. (Laughter.)
(The executive order is signed.)
Thank you. Thank you, everyone. (Applause.)
Q: Mr. President, how did President Putin respond to your call today, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I made it very clear to him that -- that the United States expects, when a ransomware operation is coming from his soil, even though it's not -- not sponsored by the state, we expect them to act if we give them enough information to act on who that is.
And, secondly, that we have set up a means of communications now, on a regular basis, to be able to communicate to one another when each of us thinks something is happening in another country that affects the home country.
And so, it went well. I'm optimistic.
Q: You said, three weeks ago, there would be consequences. Will there be, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.",NA,"Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on Signing an Executive Order Promoting Competition in The American Economy and an Exchange with Reporters Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/351264 ",,,,,,,,,,,
8-Jul-21,Remarks on the Drawdown of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan and an Exchange with Reporters,"THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Earlier today, I was briefed by our senior military and national security leaders on the status of the drawdown of U.S. forces and allied forces in Afghanistan.
When I announced our drawdown in April, I said we would be out by September, and we're on track to meet that target.
Our military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on August 31st. The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way, prioritizing the safety of our troops as they depart.
Our military commanders advised me that once I made the decision to end the war, we needed to move swiftly to conduct the main elements of the drawdown. And in this context, speed is safety.
And thanks to the way in which we have managed our withdrawal, no one -- no one U.S. forces or any forces have -- have been lost. Conducting our drawdown differently would have certainly come with a increased risk of safety to our personnel.
To me, those risks were unacceptable. And there was never any doubt that our military would perform this task efficiently and with the highest level of professionalism. That's what they do. And the same is true of our NATO Allies and partners who have supported -- we are supporting, and supporting us as well, as they conclude their retrograde.
I want to be clear: The U.S. military mission in Afghanistan continues through the end of August. We remain -- we retain personnel and capacities in the country, and we maintain some authority -- excuse me, the same authority under which we've been operating for some time.
As I said in April, the United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan: to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and to deliver justice to Osama Bin Laden, and to degrade the terrorist threat to keep Afghanistan from becoming a base from which attacks could be continued against the United States. We achieved those objectives. That's why we went.
We did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build. And it's the right and the responsibility of the Afghan people alone to decide their future and how they want to run their country.
Together, with our NATO Allies and partners, we have trained and equipped over three hu- -- nearly 300,000 current serving members of the military -- of the Afghan National Security Force, and many beyond that who are no longer serving. Add to that, hundreds of thousands more Afghan National Defense and Security Forces trained over the last two decades.
We provided our Afghan partners with all the tools -- let me emphasize: all the tools, training, and equipment of any modern military. We provided advanced weaponry. And we're going to continue to provide funding and equipment. And we'll ensure they have the capacity to maintain their air force.
But most critically, as I stressed in my meeting just two weeks ago with President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah, Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future that the Afghan people want and they deserve.
In our meeting, I also assured Ghani that U.S. support for the people of Afghanistan will endure. We will continue to provide civilian and humanitarian assistance, including speaking out for the rights of women and girls.
I intend to maintain our diplomatic presedence [presence] in Afghanistan, and we are coordinating closely with our international partners in order to continue to secure the international airport.
And we're going to engage in a determined diplomacy to pursue peace and a peace agreement that will end this senseless violence.
I've asked Secretary of State Blinken and our Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation to work vigorously with the parties in Afghanistan, as well as the regional and international stakeholders to support a negotiated solution.
To be clear -- to be clear: Countries in the region have an essential role to play in supporting a peaceful settlement. We'll work with them, and they should help step up their efforts as well.
We're going to continue to work for the release of detained Americans, including Mark -- excuse me -- Fre-- Frerichs -- I want to pronounce the name correctly; I mis- -- I misspoke -- so that he can return to his family safely.
We're also going to continue to make sure that we take on the Afghan nationals who work side-by-side with U.S. forces, including interpreters and translators -- since we're no longer going to have military there after this; we're not going to need them and they have no jobs -- who are also going to be vital to our efforts so they -- and they've been very vital -- and so their families are not exposed to danger as well.
We've already dramatically accelerated the procedure time for Special Immigrant Visas to bring them to the United States.
Since I was inaugurated on January 20th, we've already approved 2,500 Special Immigrant Visas to come to the United States. Up to now, fewer than half have exercised their right to do that. Half have gotten on aircraft and com -- commercial flights and come, and the other half believe they want to stay -- at least thus far.
We're working closely with Congress to change the authorization legislation so that we can streamline the process of approving those visas. And those who have stood up for the operation to physically relocate thousands of Afghans and their families before the U.S. military mission concludes so that, if they choose, they can wait safely outside of Afghanistan while their U.S. visas are being processed.
The operation has identified U.S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as in third countries, to host our Afghan allies, if they ch- -- if they so choose. And, starting this month, we're going to begin to re- -- re- -- reloc- -- we're going to begin relocation flights for Afghanistan SIV applicants and their families who choose to leave.
We have a point person in the White House and at the State Department-led task force coordinating all these efforts.
But our message to those women and men is clear: There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose, and we will stand with you just as you stood with us.
When I made the decision to end the U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, I judged that it was not in the national interest of the United States of America to continue fighting this war indefinitely. I made the decision with clear eyes, and I am briefed daily on the battlefield updates.
But for those who have argued that we should stay just six more months or just one more year, I ask them to consider the lessons of recent history.
In 2011, the NATO Allies and partners agreed that we would end our combat mission in 2014. In 2014, some argued, ""One more year."" So we kept fighting, and we kept taking casualties. In 2015, the same. And on and on.
Nearly 20 years of experience has shown us that the current security situation only confirms that ""just one more year"" of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution but a recipe for being there indefinitely.
It's up to Afghans to make the decision about the future of their country.
Others are more direct. Their argument is that we should stay with the Afghan -- in Afghanistan indefinitely. In doing so, they point to the fact that we -- we have not taken losses in this last year, so they claim that the cost of just maintaining the status quo is minimal.
But that ignores the reality and the facts that already presented on the ground in Afghanistan when I took office: The Taliban was at its strongest mil- -- is at its strongest militarily since 2001.
The number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan had been reduced to a bare minimum. And the United States, in the last administration, made an agreement that the -- with the Taliban to remove all our forces by May 1 of this past -- of this year. That's what I inherited. That agreement was the reason the Taliban had ceased major attacks against U.S. forces.
If, in April, I had instead announced that the United States was going to back -- going back on that agreement made by the last administration -- [that] the United States and allied forces would remain in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future -- the Taliban would have again begun to target our forces.
The status quo was not an option. Staying would have meant
U.S. troops taking casualties; American men and women back in the middle of a civil war. And we would have run the risk of having to send more troops back into Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops.
Once that agreement with the Taliban had been made, staying with a bare minimum force was no longer possible.
So let me ask those who wanted us to stay: How many more -- how many thousands more of America's daughters and sons are you willing to risk? How long would you have them stay?
Already we have members of our military whose parents fought in Afghanistan 20 years ago. Would you send their children and their grandchildren as well? Would you send your own son or daughter?
After 20 years -- a trillion dollars spent training and equipping hundreds of thousands of Afghan National Security and Defense Forces, 2,448 Americans killed, 20,722 more wounded, and untold thousands coming home with unseen trauma to their mental health -- I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.
The United States cannot afford to remain tethered to policies creating a response to a world as it was 20 years ago. We need to meet the threats where they are today.
Today, the terrorist threat has metastasized beyond Afghanistan. So, we are repositioning our resources and adapting our counterterrorism posture to meet the threats where they are now significantly higher: in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
But make no mistake: Our military and intelligence leaders are confident they have the capabilities to protect the homeland and our interests from any resurgent terrorist challenge emerging or emanating from Afghanistan.
We are developing a counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region, and act quickly and decisively if needed.
And we also need to focus on shoring up America's core strengths to meet the strategic competition with China and other nations that is really going to determine -- determine our future.
We have to defeat COVID-19 at home and around the world, make sure we're better prepared for the next pandemic or biological threat.
We need to establish international norms for cyberspace and the use of emergenc- -- emerging technologies.
We need to take concerted action to fight existential threats of climate change.
And we will be more formidable to our adversaries and competitors over the long run if we fight the battles of the next 20 years, not the last 20 years.
Finally, I want to recognize the incredible sacrifice and dedication that the U.S. military and civilian personnel, serving alongside our Allies and partners, have made over the last two decades in Afghanistan.
I want to honor the significance of what they've accomplished and the great personal risk they encountered and the incredible cost to their families: pursuing the terrorist threat in some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planet -- and I've been almost throughout that entire country; ensuring there hasn't been another attack on the homeland from Afghanistan for the last 20 years; taking out Bin Laden.
I want to thank you all for your service and the dedication to the mission so many of you have given, and to the sacrifices that you and your families have made over the long course of this war.
We'll never forget those who gave the last full measure of devotion for their country in Afghanistan, nor those whose lives have been immeasurably altered by wounds sustained in service to their country.
We're ending America's longest war, but we'll always, always honor the bravery of the American patriots who served in it.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Q: Mr. President -- do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President?
Q: Is a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitable?
THE PRESIDENT: No, it is not.
Q: Why?
THE PRESIDENT: Because you -- the Afghan troops have 300,000 well-equipped -- as well-equipped as any army in the world -- and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban. It is not inevitable.
Q: Do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President? Do you trust the Taliban, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: You -- is that a serious question?
Q: It is absolutely a serious question. Do you trust the Taliban?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I do not.
Q: Do you trust handing over the country to the Taliban?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I do not trust the Taliban.
Q: So why are you handing the country over?
Q: Mr. President, is the U.S. responsible for the deaths of Afghans after you leave the country?
Q: Mr. President, will you amplify that question, please? Will you amplify your answer, please -- why you don't trust the Taliban?
THE PRESIDENT: It's a -- it's a silly question. Do I trust the Taliban? No. But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped, and more re- -- more competent in terms of conducting war.
Yes, ma'am.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Given the amount of money that has been spent and the number of lives that have been lost, in your view, with making this decision, were the last 20 years worth it?
THE PRESIDENT: You know my record. I can tell by the way you asked the question.
I opposed permanently having American forces in Afghanistan. I argued, from the beginning, as you may recall -- it came to light after the administration was over, last -- our administration -- no nation has ever unified Afghanistan. No nation. Empires have gone there and not done it.
The focus we had -- and I strongly support it -- and you may remember I physically went to Afghanistan. I was up in that pass where Osama bin Laden was -- allegedly escaped or -- out of harm's way.
We went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as I said at the time. The second reason was to eliminate al Qaeda's capacity to deal with more attacks on the United States from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives -- period.
That's what I believed, from the beginning, why we should be and why we should have gone to Afghanistan. That job had been over for some time. And that's why I believe that this is the right decision and, quite frankly, overdue.
Q: Mr. President, has the civilian government hailed the people of Afghanistan?
Q: Mr. President, thank you very much. Your own intelligence community has assessed that the Afghan government will likely collapse.
THE PRESIDENT: That is not true.
Q: Is it -- can you please clarify what they have told you about whether that will happen or not?
THE PRESIDENT: That is not true. They did not -- they didn't -- did not reach that conclusion.
Q: So what is the level of confidence that they have that it will not collapse?
THE PRESIDENT: The Afghan government and leadership has to come together. They clearly have the capacity to sustain the government in place. The question is: Will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it? It's not a question of whether they have the capacity. They have the capacity. They have the forces. They have the equipment. The question is: Will they do it?
And I want to make clear what I made clear to Ghani: that we are not going just sus- -- walk away and not sustain their ability to maintain that force. We are. We're going to also work to make sure we help them in terms of everything from food necessities and other things in -- in the region. But -- but, there's not a conclusion that, in fact, they cannot defeat the Taliban.
I believe the only way there's going to be -- this is now Joe Biden, not the intelligence community -- the only way there's ultimately going to be peace and security in Afghanistan is that they work out a modus vivendi with the Taliban and they make a judgment as to how they can make peace.
And the likelihood there's going to be one unified government in Afghanistan controlling the whole country is highly unlikely.
Q: Mr. President, thank you. But we have talked to your own top general in Afghanistan, General Scott Miller. He told ABC News the conditions are so concerning at this point that it could result in a civil war. So, if Kabul falls to the Taliban, what will the United States do about it?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, you've said two things -- one, that if it could result in a civil war -- that's different than the Taliban succeeding, number one. Number two, the question of what will be done is going to be implicated -- is going to implicate the entire region as well. There's a number of countries who have a grave concern about what's going to happen in Afghanistan relative to their security.
The question is: How much of a threat to the United States of America and to our allies is whatever results in terms of a government or an agreement? That's when that judgement will be made.
Q: Mr. President, some Vietnamese veterans see echoes of their experience in this withdrawal in Afghanistan. Do you see any parallels between this withdrawal and what happened in Vietnam, with some people feeling --
THE PRESIDENT: None whatsoever. Zero. What you had is -- you had entire brigades breaking through the gates of our embassy -- six, if I'm not mistaken.
The Taliban is not the south -- the North Vietnamese army. They're not -- they're not remotely comparable in terms of capability. There's going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of a embassy in the -- of the United States from Afghanistan. It is not at all comparable.
Q: And, Mr. President --
Q: Mr. President, can I --
THE PRESIDENT: I'll take him and then I'll -- and then I'll go -- I'll go to the other side. Hang on a second.
Q: Mr. President, how serious was the corruption among the Afghanistan government to this mission failing there?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, the mission hasn't failed, yet. There is in Afghanistan -- in all parties, there's been corruption. The question is, can there be an agreement on unity of purpose? What is the objective?
For example, it started off -- there were going to be negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan National Security Forces and the Afghan government. That -- that of -- it didn't come to -- it didn't come to fruition.
So the question now is, where do they go from here? That -- the jury is still out. But the likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.
Yes, ma'am.
Q: Mr. President, will the United States be responsible for the loss of Afghan civilian lives that could happen after a --
THE PRESIDENT: No.
Q: -- military exit?
THE PRESIDENT: No, no, no. It's up to the people of Afghanistan to decide on what government they want, not us to impose the government on them. No country has ever been able to do that.
Keep in mind, as a student of history, as I'm sure you are, never has Afghanistan been a united country, not in all of its history. Not in all of its history.
Q: Mr. President, if this isn't a ""mission accomplished"" moment, what is it, in your view?
THE PRESIDENT: No, there's no ""mission accomplished.""
Q: How would you describe it?
THE PRESIDENT: The mission was accomplished in that we get -- got Osama bin Laden, and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world.
Q: Mr. President, if ""speed is safety,"" as you just said in your remarks, are you satisfied with the timeline of relocating Afghan nationals? Is it happening quickly enough to your satisfaction, if it may not happen until next month, at the end?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, much of it has already happened. There's already been people -- about a thousand people have gotten on aircraft and come home -- come to the United States already on commercial aircraft. So, as I said, there's over 2,500 people that as -- from January to now, have gotten those visas. And only half decided that they wanted to leave.
The point is that I think the whole process has to be speeded up, period, in terms of being able to get these visas.
Q: Why can't the U.S. evacuate these Afghan translators to the United States to await their visa processing as some immigrants at the southern border have been allowed to do?
THE PRESIDENT: Because the law doesn't allow that to happen. And that's why we're asking the Congress to consider changing the law.
But in the meantime, we can guarantee their safety, if they wish to leave, by taking them to third countries and/or, while the wait is taking place, to come to -- to -- and hopefully, while they're waiting there, to be able to bring them back to the United States, if that's what they choose to do.
Q: And what do you make -- and what do you make, sir, of the Taliban being in Russia today?
Q: Mr. President, I'm from Afghanistan. I am Afghan (inaudible) woman. Any message -- good message for Afghan women in future? Because they have achievement -- they are really concerned about their achievement.
THE PRESIDENT: They are very concerned, with good reason.
Q: Yes.
THE PRESIDENT: When I was in Afghanistan -- I've been there a number of times -- I remember being in a school outside and -- and, by the way, the schools in Afghanistan are not fundamentally unlike schools in the West Coast, where they have, you know, a -- an area in the middle that is sort of like -- it looks like a playground and single-story buildings connected around it.
And I remember saying to -- speaking to a group of young women -- I guess they were roughly -- don't hold me to this -- they look like they'd be 14, 15 years old. And they're in school, and there's a tiered classroom with single light bulbs hanging from the ceiling, as I know you know.
And I said, ""You know, the United States came here to make sure that we got this terrorist, Osama bin Laden, and that terrorists didn't amass again to -- to go after our country. And then we're going to have to leave."" And a young woman said, ""You can't leave. You can't leave."" It was -- it was heartbreaking. ""You can't leave,"" she said. ""I want to be a doctor. I want to be a doctor. I want to be a doctor. If you leave, I'll never be able to be a doctor."" Well, that's why we spent so much time and money training the Afghan Security Forces to do the work of defending that. If every work --
Well, anyway -- so, yes, I'm aware.
I'm going to take one more question.
Q: Mr. President, have you spoken with any Taliban officials about the withdrawal?
Q: (Inaudible) the Taliban being in Russia today -- the Taliban --
Q: Mr. -- Mr. President, I -- thank you. I wanted to ask: With the benefit of hindsight, you've spoken to the fact that the Taliban are sort of at their militarily strongest point that you've seen in 20 years. How do you feel personally about that, with the benefit of hindsight and all of the dollars and investments and American troops that were sent there?
THE PRESIDENT: Relative to the training and capacity of the ANSF and the training of the federal police, they're not even close in terms of their capacity.
I was making the point -- the point was that here we were; I was -- the argument is, ""Well, we could stay because no one was dying. No Americans are being shot. So why leave?"" Once the agreement was made by the last administration that we were going to leave by May 1st, it was very clear that a Taliban that had always been a problem was even a more sophisticated problem than they were than before. Not more sophisticated than the ANSF, the government. More than they were.
The point being that it would have increased the prospect that they would have been able to take more lives of Americans if they decided we weren't going to go after them. That was the point I was making.
Thank you all so very much. Thank you.",NA,"Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on the Drawdown of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan and an Exchange with Reporters Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/350746 ",,,,,,,,,,,
7-Jul-21,"Remarks at McHenry County College in Crystal Lake, Illinois","THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Edith. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Please. Please, be seated.
Mr. President -- what he hadn't told you today: He had to delay his vacation to be here today. (Laughter.) He heard Biden is coming. He goes, ""Oh, my God, when is he coming?"" (Laughter.) But -- (laughs) -- so he could show me around McHenry County College.
I'm glad to be here with great Illinois leaders. I want you all to -- you know, America is back. America is back. (Applause.) And in no small part because of the men and women that I serve with.
Governor Pritzker, stand up, man. Stand up. (Applause.) This is a good man.
If you really want someone in a foxhole with you when you're in trouble, you want Senator Tammy Duckworth. Tammy. (Applause.)
And the guy I rely on more than anyone else in the United States Senate -- and I've served with him for years; we have a lot in common in terms of losses as well as gains -- is Dick Durbin. Dick. (Applause.)
And Congresswoman Underwood, who got me a passport to her town. (Applause.) Her mom and dad are mildly proud with good reason. (Laughter.) Good reason. Actually, her mom looks like her sister. (Laughter.)
Last week, I was up in Wisconsin to talk about a bipartisan agreement to modernize American infrastructure and, in the process, create millions of good-paying jobs. That's not my estimate -- that's Wall Street estimates; that's everybody's estimate. Millions of good-paying jobs. Not $7, not $8, not $10, not even $15 an hour. Good prevailing-wage jobs. (Applause.)
And here's what it means for Illinois: You've got, like many states -- all states -- you've got 230- -- 2,374 bridges and over 6,200 miles of highway that are in disrepair.
As a result, every driver in this state pays a hidden tax
of about $600 per year in wasted time and wasted fuel because of the nature of the roads and bridges -- and, by the way, you're better than a lot of states -- not to mention the challenge of getting to work or getting to the daycare center on time to avoid that late fee when you pick up your child.
Your governor has an ambitious infrastructure plan, and under a bipartisan infrastructure agreement, we're going to make the biggest investment in roads and bridges since the construction of the Interstate Highway System, literally creating millions of good-paying jobs. (Applause.)
And God willing, we're not going to have 40 -- 40 weeks of ""This is Infrastructure Week."" (Laughter.) Remember those?
Think what it will mean to McHenry's entrepreneurial agricultural program if we can get products more easily to Chicago. Think about how much easier life will be when it's quicker to drive on Randall Road. (Laughter.)
Look, this agreement also allows us to replace every lead pipe and service line in America, benefitting 10 million homes. (Applause.) It's going to address -- it's going to address lead exposure to 400,000 of our schools and daycare facilities where children drink that water. This would be the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history when we pass it.
In every -- 1 in every 10 people in Illinois lacks access to high-speed Internet. The bipartisan agreement that Dick and others have made sure we're getting -- the agreement allows us to connect every American to reliable, high-speed, affordable Internet -- every single American, rural and urban. And, by the way, those of you who are parents, who had kids at home, tell me what Internet means this last year. (Laughter.) If they're school age.
Well, from 2010 to 2020, Illinois experienced 49 extreme weather events -- although I heard today from the senator north of here that there -- a Republican senator -- there is no global warming. Just so you know, there's no such thing. (Laughter.)
But those weather events cost this state roughly $50 billion in damages. And we're going to up upgrade the electric grid to make it more resilient to extreme weather and other threats.
There's a lot more the agreement is going to do to encourage the physical and ensure -- the physical infrastructure lays the foundation for a strong, durable, and sustainable competitive economy.
But what I want to talk to you about today is human infrastructure. It's essential to that foundation, as well. To truly win the 21st century and once again lead the world, to truly build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, to truly deal everybody in this time, we need to invest in our people. We need to invest in our people.
That's why, in addition to the bipartisan infrastructure agreement that I believe we're going to get done, I'm here to make the case for the second critical part of my domestic agenda. It's a combination of parts of my American Jobs Plan that were essential and not included in the bipartisan infrastructure plan, as well as my American Families Plan.
In Washington, they call it a ""reconciliation bill."" That's a fancy way of saying, with a filibuster that our friends on the other side use constantly -- more than ever been used in history -- it means you got to get 60 votes to get anything done. We're 50-50 Senate with a Vice President who happens to be a Democrat.
And back in the campaign, you know, I said we're going to build back, and we're going to build back better. Not just -- we can't just build back; we got to build back better.
And today, I want to outline some of the key pieces of this Build Back Better agenda and what's it going to do for the people of Illinois and the people of the United States.
It's about a country, once again, that inspires and leads the world with the opportunities we provide, the cures we discovery, the technolog- -- that we discover -- the technologies we pioneer, and industries we create. You know, and a nation that leads the world in combatting the existential threat of climate change.
The Build Back Better plan -- agenda starts with education. You know, one of the reasons why we were the leading country in the world for so long, and still on the edge, is because we're the first nation -- industrial nation in the world to require -- to allow 12 years of free education back at the turn of the 20th century. But everybody is caught up.
At the time, they were debating what should be education in America. The argument was there should be 12 years of free education. And that's what's got us ahead. That's what had us leap ahead of the rest of the world.
But as (inaudible) today, everybody is caught up. Does anybody think, in the 21st century, with the change that's taking place in technology and across the board, that 12 years of education is enough to be able to live a middle-class life? I don't think so.
And so, the fact of the matter is we've decided -- I've decided we should have a minimum of 14 years of education. Fourteen years of education -- which I'll explain in a second.
You know, as the First Lady -- I'm Jill Biden's husband, but -- (laughter) -- but as Jill would say -- and she's a full-time community college professor while being the First Lady -- she often says, ""Any nation that out-educates us is going to out-compete us."" Any nation that out-educates us is going to out compete us.
That's why I want to guarantee an additional four additional years of public education for every person in America, starting with providing two years of universal, high-quality preschool for three- and four-year-olds, building -- (applause) -- building on what the governor has been doing here in Illinois. (Applause.)
In the last 10 years, studies out of the great universities -- study of a high-quality program here in Chicago -- found that low-income children participating in preschool were 47 percent more likely to earn an associate's degree or higher, and get through school without any difficulty. We have to build on that foundation for future success. And then I want to add two years of free community college for everyone. (Applause.)
And we can afford it. I'll tell you how.
That can boost the earnings of a high school graduate with low-wage jobs by nearly $6,000 a year on average.
The average annual cost of a two-year degree in Illinois is $4,200. Under my proposal, that cost would be zero. (Applause.)
But it's not just tuition that's expensive; as was pointed out, living expenses, housing, meals, transportation. And that's why I propose to increase a maximum Pell Grant -- which, if you are below a certain income, you qualify for a Pell Grant -- from about $6,500 to $8,000 a year. (Applause.) And that will fill it out.
I know -- I know that here at McHenry, you have a dual enrollment program so students from places like Woodstock High School and other high schools, you get credit for taking college classes here. Well, my plan will -- will provide resources to expand programs like the one you have here.
My plan will also do more to invest in high-quality job training and apprenticeships in fast-growing sectors like public health, childcare, manufacturing, information technology, clean energy so that all Americans can get the skills that employers want that lead to good middle-class and -- I was -- I make no apology -- union jobs. (Applause.)
It would also -- it would also make strategic investments in teachers -- in the teacher pipeline. Because even before the pandemic, our school system was 100,000 teachers short here in America, particularly in high-demand areas.
Our children are the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft, and our teachers are the ones that help them
believe they can do anything. I bet every one of your success can name the teacher that helped change your life. I bet every one -- every one of us. There's somebody who came along and made us believe in ourselves. That's the really sec- -- the secret of teachers.
My plan will reduce student debt for future teachers, double the size of the annual federal scholarships for future teachers.
We'll also support $100 billion in school infrastructure improvements, including community college, to make sure that they are safe and healthy places for learning, and that all students -- with the labs and technology they need to be able to compete in the 21st century.
Of course, an ability to take these jobs often depends on the availability of childcare. As a single father, when I was first got to the Senate, I had two young boys who had just lost their mom and their sister in an automobile accident. If I hadn't had the family I have -- my sister, best -- my younger sister, my best friend, and my brother, and my mom help out -- I couldn't have done it. But not everybody has that kind of support.
I just toured your Children's Learning Center. It's an amazing resource. Students and faculty can have their children cared for. Students can earn their associate degrees in early childhood education as well. High-quality childcare options should be the rule, not the exception.
So, on my way in here, I met with Mike Sayre, who wrote me a letter about his struggle to find affordable childcare, and he wanted me to -- he wanted to know what my plans were. Well, Mike, I hope you know now. Here we are.
My plan is to provide access to quality, affordable childcare with more childcare centers in community college campuses with new and upgraded childcare facilities all across the country. (Applause.)
Businesses -- businesses will get a full tax credit to build on-site facilities. And the reason they want to do that is not just to be nice. Business -- because studies show when there's an on-site childcare center, businesses have less employee turnover, less absenteeism, and higher productivity. It's overwhelmingly in their interest to do it.
Middle-class families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality childcare for children up to age five. And the most hard-pressed working families won't have to pay a dime.
My plan will also invest in childcare workforce with better wages, benefits, and training opportunities.
Look, we're also going to give parents the option to take up to an $8,000 tax credit to cover childcare expenses, if that's the preferred route. That's good for families and it's good for our economy, and it will create more jobs.
My plan will also provide up to 12 weeks of paid family leave for medical -- (applause) -- up to 12 weeks of paid family leave. Look, we're one of the few major economies in the world that doesn't cover paid family and medical leave.
And the most difficult moments some will ever face:
No one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck and take caring of someone you love -- a parent, a spouse, a child.
Look, we will tackle the maternal mortality crisis, as well, that impacts on Black and Native American mothers disproportionately. And what -- and I want to thank Congresswoman Underwood for her leadership in this area. (Applause.) For real.
As I've said again and again, people who really need a tax break in this country are America's working families. It's time they get a tax break.
So, my Build Back Better agenda would extend the expanded Child Tax Credit we passed under my American Rescue Plan. Those of you who have children under the age of seven [six], you're going to get -- and depending on your income -- your income taxes -- you're going to get a cash payment back. Up to now, guess what? You get $2,000 to declare a dependent. If you have two children, you get $4,000 off a $10,000 tax bill. It's important.
But if you don't have enough -- you don't have enough -- you don't make enough money to be able to have -- to owe that kind of tax, you don't get a tax credit, you don't get anything. Well, under this proposal, guess what? You're in a situation where if you have a child under the age of seven [six], you get back $3,600 in cash. In addition to that, those of you who are in that situation are going to start to see that coming in by the end of this month, on a monthly basis. It can change the lives of people.
Starting next week, families will begin to receive one of the largest-ever single-year tax cuts aimed to families with children. And every child under age 6 is $3,600; every child between 6 and 17 is $3,000. It's not as a credit against your taxes, but a direct payment. You'll get cash. Cash. That's what you'll get.
For example, a middle-class family with two children can expect to receive $7,200. You'll get the first half -- the $3,600 -- paid out at $600 a month between July and December, and you'll get the rest between January and Tax Day.
With this one tax cut, every study shows that childcare -- childcare is cutting poverty in ha- -- by 40 percent. Families with children who qualify for this, it cuts poverty by 40 percent.
So, let's extend the tax cut at least through 2025, and let's expand -- (applause) -- let's expand free meals for millions more children in schools, with the assistance during the summer months when they don't have access to those school meals.
We support families with children. We also need to provide greater dignity for our nation's senior citizens who care for them.
Look, there are hundreds of thousands of older adults
and people with disabilities who need home- and community-based care services. They qualify for it under Medicaid, but there's a backlog of thousands of people. But one study showed that $3,000 spent helping a senior stay in their home by providing -- it saves the country more than $20,000 a year in medical costs.
At the same time, more than 1.5 million Americans work in homecare. They're disproportionately women, women of color, and immigrants, and those jobs are among the lowest paid in our economy. One in six homecare workers lives in poverty. We need to do better on both sides of the equation.
My plan expands homecare for older and disabled Americans,
while improving jobs and pay for homecare workers who care for them.
And here's the deal: You save a lot of money if you don't have to go to a home. Keeping people in their own home, mentally and every other way, is a benefit -- a significant benefit for the community, as well as cost.
We also need to continue to make healthcare more affordable. When we lowered premiums and expanded coverage for the American Re- -- in my American Rescue Plan, more than 1.5 million people signed up for what used to be called ""Obamacare."" I want to make these premium reductions permanent so we can get even more people covered.
We need to deal with the shortage of affordable housing in America. Over 10 million renters in this country pay more than half their income for the rent on their apartment, and the lack of affordable housing prevents people from moving to communities where there are more opportunities.
So we're going to make historic investment in affordable housing, increasing and improving the housing supply by building and rehabilitating more than 2 million homes, especially in places that need more housing.
And we need to invest not just in the physical and human infrastructure of today, we need to invest in the jobs and industries of tomorrow.
Three decades ago -- and this always disturbs me, even just repeating it -- three decades ago, the United States was number one in the world for a share of their GDP being invested in research and development. We were number one in the world. We're now number eight [nine] in the world. Number eight [nine] in the world. China was number -- or -- excuse me, we're -- China was number nine [eight] in the world; now they're number two in the world.
Folks, Democrats and Republicans agree we can't afford to lose this race. They came together in the Senate on an Innovation and Competition Act -- that Dick was very much a part of -- to help us grow the industries that win the jobs of the future.
We need to lay the foundation for the next generation of American jobs and American leadership in manufacturing and technology.
We're going to invest in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority-Serving Institutions because while these schools may not have the endowments or the labs needed to generate these jobs, these students are just as capable of learning about all of the things that are going to provide the jobs of the future.
And, of course, no challenge is as urgent as climate change. Last week, I met with eight governors for a better part of an hour, all from the western states, Republicans and Democrats. They're facing extreme heat, record drought,
and a fire season that threatens to be much longer and more dangerous and more destructive than ever.
Last year, for example, more than 10 million acres burned in the West -- 10 million acres -- not counting the lives lost and homes lost. More land than exists in my home state of Delaware and my neighboring state of Maryland combined. So if a fire swept through and took out every single thing in the state of Delaware and Maryland. The drought conditions, this year, are twice as bad. You've seen the pictures. Reservoirs that are 40 feet down, 50 feet down.
The extreme weather isn't just in the West. In Illinois, farmers downstate are dealing with more frequent droughts. And two weeks ago, just south of here, you just had a nearly unprecedented tornado.
We can't wait any longer to deal with the climate crisis. We see it with our own eyes, and it's time to act.
The bipartisan agreement we reached makes some major strides. It's going to allow the transition of thousands of old, for example, of diesel school buses and buses -- city buses. We're going to change them to electric buses. There are roughly a half a million of these iconic yellow school buses on the road today. Ninety-five percent of them run on diesel, for example. And diesel pollutes the air and is linked to asthma and other health problems, and it hurts our communities and it causes our students to miss school.
I'll put Americans to work capping tens of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that are leaking methane. It's devastating. And the wages to fill these -- cap these wells are the same wages that it took to dig the wells, making people earn -- be able to earn a prevailing wage to do it. There's thousands of them.
But we need to go further.
I want to provide tax cuts for businesses and consumers who invest in clean energy technologies like renewables, battery storage, next-generation aviation fuels, electric vehicles.
I want to set the clean electricity standard that moves us to a fully clean and reliable grid.
These steps are going to create good-paying union jobs and spur demand for domestic manufacturing, accelerating clean energy and clean cars, growing our capacity to build those technologies on factory floors with union workers, here in the United States.
And we create a new generation of jobs in clean energy and manufacturing. And I also want to enlist a new generation of climate, conservation, and reliance workers -- excuse me, resilience workers -- like FDR did when the American work plan -- preserving our landscape with a Civilian Conservation Corps. It's a similar thing.
We can put Americans to work strengthening public lands and waters, and making our communities -- rural and urban -- more resilient against extreme weather. And we can take on the long-overdue work of advancing environmental justice by addressing pollution.
My plan is also going to give grants to spur innovative policies and land projects -- lo- -- excuse me, local projects, like installing community solar and storage and disadvanta- -- in disadvantaged communities; replacing streetlights that are made in America with LED bulbs that cost a whole lot less and last a whole lot longer; making upgrades in homes and schools
and community centers to boost energy efficiency and cut electric bills.
Folks, I've laid out a lot of plans here, but that's because it's time, and we have to think bigger, and we have to act bolder, and we have to build back better.
When we passed the American Rescue Plan, the naysayers and the doubters said it wouldn't work. Well, we've created over 3 million jobs since I took office -- more jobs in the first months of a presidential administration than any time in American history.
And last week, the Congressional Budget Office
doubled their projections of the 2021 economic growth from 3.2 percent to 7.4 percent, and the OECD thinks it could be higher. That puts the America Rescue Plan -- and our work is going to move forward to do a lot of things, including -- we're close to defeating the virus.
The last time energy -- the economy grew at this rate was in 1984 and Ronald Reagan was telling us it was an American morning. Well, this is going to be an American century. (Applause.)
With my American Families Plan and the other elements of the Build Back Better agenda, experts and Wall Street analysts have said that we'll create millions of good-paying jobs for years and decades to come, not just in the near term.
So, I'm going to be making the case to the American people until the job is done, until we bring this bipartisan deal home, until we meet the needs of families today and the economy of tomorrow. And we can pay for it.
Let me give you a rough example. This isn't -- you know, and by the way, the American -- the -- the plan for infrastructure is paid for. It's paid for. And this plan that I'm talking about -- which is really expensive if you add it all up -- well, guess what? The fact is that it's paid for as well. And let me tell you how we're going to pay for it.
Some of the ways to pay for the rest of it is: The last couple of years, for example, 55 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars did not pay a single penny in taxes -- not one single cent.
Well, I don't want to punish anybody, but everybody -- and I hope someday my grandchildren grow up to be billionaires. That'd be wonderful, especially for a guy who for 36 years was listed as the poorest man in United States Congress. (Laughter.)
But having said that, all kidding aside, everybody has to pay their fair share. I'm not trying to gouge anybody, but, I mean, just get in the game.
If we put in place a minimum 15 percent tax on the profits of corporations, the ones that didn't pay any tax, that would raise a quarter of a trillion dollars -- $240 billion.
But there's a loophole in the system called ""stepped-up basis."" That loophole goes: If I made a capital gains and I was a wealthy person, and I was going to cash in my stock, and I was going to have to pay a tax, I was going to make, you know, $400,000, and I was going to pay X amount of taxes -- if, on the way to cash it in I get hit by a truck, God forbid, and died, and it was left to my daughter, there would be no tax paid. It's not an inheritance tax. It was a tax due 10 seconds earlier.
We closed that loophole, and that saves us $400 billion a year -- not a year -- $400 billion over this period, which is enough to pay for the Child -- Child Care Tax Credit.
If we end tax breaks for fossil fuels, and make polluters pay to clean up the messes they've made, that would raise $90 billion. We're not asking them to do anything that -- that is unfair; we're just not going to subsidize them anymore. They're doing well, thank -- thank you. And the messes they made, they should clean up.
Well, if we ask the top 1 percent -- and I hope many of you are in the top 1 percent -- maybe. (Laughter.)
You know, that tax cut that was passed in 2017 was all -- it raised the deficit by over $2 trillion -- not a penny paid for, and it didn't come back with anything. That -- that, in fact -- that entire $2 trillion -- the vast majority went to the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the American people.
One percent -- you know, if we just -- 1 percent -- the folks in the top 1 percent, if they just paid their personal income state tax, the same as it was under President George Bush -- George W. Bush -- that would generate $13 billion a year. It would raise the tax from what it is now, 35, to 39 percent. It's what it -- I mean, it's not like this idea where you'd listen to the guy that used to have his job that somehow we're gouging people.
The fact of the matter is, a lot of you, if you're -- if you're a plumber or a teacher, you're probably paying 25, 26 percent. Some of you be paying higher.
But, here, look: It's enough to provide for -- that one change -- enough to provide for two years free community college for every student in America.
Now -- (applause) -- now, people say that one of the purposes of taxes is to also generate growth along with making sure that we can pay for our basic needs.
Well, let me ask you, what is more likely to grow the economy and enhance us: continuing the tax cut at 37 percent, or spending -- having to pay 39-point -- and a half percent, generating economic growth? Because now you have a tax system that will allow millions of students to go to community college.
When I was with Barack as Vice President, he asked me to do a study. And I spent -- and I -- your sister, Penny Pritzker, was part of my effort to taking care of it. And the effort was simple. It came along, and we said, ""Okay, what do we…"" -- and we (inaudible) three hundred and, I think, forty-seven -- don't hold me to the exact number -- of the CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies. Said, ""What do you need most?"" You know what they said to almost -- to a person? ""I need a better-educated workforce."" They're not prepared to pay for it.
Imagine if we present the world a nation with a better educated workforce. It helps everybody. The point is, we can pay for our entire plan and make the tax system fairer for all Americans. It's about time.
There's a lot of work ahead of us to finish the job, but we're going to get it done. We're going to reimagine what our economy and our future could be, and show the world -- just as importantly, we'll show ourselves -- that democracy -- democracy can deliver for the people of Illinois and the people of America, and the world can lead again. (Applause.)
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I know that's a boring speech, but it's an important speech.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.

4-Jul-21,Remarks on Independence Day,"Today -- today we celebrate America -- (applause) -- our freedom, our liberty, our independence. The Fourth of July is a sacred day in our country -- a day of history, of hope, remembrance and resolve, of promise and possibilities.
Before me stands monuments of the greatest and the goodness of our nation -- monuments of light and liberty. There's a towering memorial to George Washington -- the general who led our Revolution and the President who set our nation on its course.
There's a memorial to Thomas Jefferson, whose words about liberty and equality literally changed the world.
And across the Tidal Basin from the Jefferson Memorial, there stands Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. -- his arms crossed, his eyes fixed ahead toward the promised land where equality is not only an aspiration, but a reality. (Applause.)
They helped define who we are, guide what we do, remind us of the work that history has given us in our own time.
This year, the Fourth of July is a day of special celebration, for we are emerging from the darkness of years; a year of pandemic and isolation; a year of pain, fear, and heartbreaking loss.
Just think back to where this nation was a year ago. Think back to where you were a year ago. And think about how far we've come.
From silent streets -- (applause) -- from silent streets to crowded parade routes lined with people waving American flags; from empty stadiums and arenas to fans back to their seats cheering together again; from families pressing hands against a window to grandparents hugging their grandchildren once again.
We're back traveling again. We're back seeing one another again. Businesses are opening and hiring again. We're seeing record job creation and record economic growth -- the best in four decades and, I might add, the best in the world. (Applause.)
Today, all across this nation, we can say with confidence: America is coming back together. (Applause.)
Two hundred and forty-five years ago, we declared our independence from a distant king. Today, we're closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus. That's not to say the battle against COVID-19 is over. We've got a lot more work to do.
But just as our Declaration in 1776 was not a call to action -- was a call to action, not a reason for complacency or a claim of victory -- it was a call to action -- the same is true today.
Back then, we had the power of an idea on our side. Today, we have the power of science. (Applause.) Thanks to our heroic vaccine effort, we've gained the upper hand against this virus. We can live our lives, our kids can go back to school, our economy is roaring back.
Don't get me wrong, COVID-19 is -- has not been vanquished. We all know powerful variants have emerged, like the Delta variant, but the best defense against these variants is to get vaccinated. (Applause.)
My fellow Americans, it's the most patriotic thing you can do. So, please, if you haven't gotten vaccinated, do it -- do it now for yourself, for your loved ones, for your community, and for your country.
You know, that's how we're going to stay ahead of these variants and protect the hard-won progress we've made. We never again want to be where we were a year ago today. (Applause.)
So, today, while the virus hasn't been vanquished, we know this: It no longer controls our lives. It no longer paralyzes our nation. And it's within our power to make sure it never does again. And for that, we can thank the scientists and researchers, the educators, and all the other frontline and essential workers, like many of you here today -- (applause) --
who became the light to see us through the darkness.
I hope you know that you, the American people, have been part of one of the most remarkable achievements in American history. But in this moment of joy, we know that this day falls hard on all those who've lost a loved one.
So I've told you before: Each day, I carry a card in my pocket with my schedule on it. In the back of that schedule, on that card, are the number of Americans who've lost their lives to COVID -- the precise number.
As of tonight, that number is 603,018 people who have lost their lives. They're husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, grandparents, friends, neighbors, coworkers.
And we also remember all those who lost this year -- that we lost and families lost to other causes -- other causes of death and cruel twists of fate. They, too, left behind loved ones unable to grieve or mourn or find closure. Each of them meant the world to someone they left behind. And those of you who've been through all this know that to heal, you have to remember. We have to remember them, and we will. We'll commit to always remember them. That's what we'll do.
I've long said that America is unique. Unlike every other nation on Earth, we were founded based on an idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all people are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights -- among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
And while we've never fully lived up to those words, we have never given up on them. They continue to animate us, and they remind us what, at our best, we as Americans believe: We, Americans -- we believe in honesty and decency, in treating everyone with dignity and respect, giving everyone a fair shot, demonizing no one, giving hate no safe harbor, and leaving no one behind.
We lead by the power of our example, not the example of our power. And we're part of som- -- something so much bigger than ourselves. We stand as a beacon to the world.
It's a code. It's a code -- uniquely American code. It's who we are.
To all the service members and your families who are here tonight, today, all of you serving around the world: It's the greatest honor to serve as your Commander-in-Chief.
Jill and I -- (applause) -- Jill and I, and our entire family, thank you for your service and sacrifice. Like so many military families thinking of your loved ones who served, we think of our son Beau today.
You're all part of a long chain of patriots who pledged their lives and their sacred honor in defense of this nation and democracy around the world; for freedom and fair play; for peace and security and opportunity; for the cause of justice; for the soul of America itself.
But the defense of all that we love doesn't fall on your shoulders alone. It falls on all -- all of us -- every one of us -- every American.
Each day, we're reminded there's nothing guaranteed about our democracy, nothing guaranteed about our way of life. We have to fight for it, defend it, earn it.
Folks, it's up to all of us to protect the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; the right to equal justice under the law; the right to vote and have that vote counted; the right -- (applause) -- the right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and know that our children and grandchildren will be safe on this planet for generations to come -- (applause); the right to rise in the world as far as your God-given calent [talent] can take you, unlimited by barriers of privilege or power.
One of the great gifts of the spirit of independence -- and think about this: One of the great gifts is our capacity to see ourselves whole and see ourselves honestly -- what we've gotten right, what we've gotten wrong. It's a measure of the greatness of America, and we are a great nation. We don't seek to bury the wrongs. We face it. We work to make it right.
You know, history tells us that when we stand together, when we unite in common cause, when we see ourselves not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans, then there's simply no limit to what we can achieve. (Applause.) None.
And today we see the results of the unity of purpose -- the unity of purpose in -- forging in our nati- -- we're forging in our nation, for together we're beating the virus. Together, we're breathing life into our economy. Together, we will rescue our people from division and despair. But together we must do it.
Over the past year, we've lived through some of our darkest days. Now I truly believe -- I give you my word as a Biden -- I truly believe we're about to see our brightest future. (Applause.)
Folks, this is a special nation, a great nation. And there is a timeless truth about America. The most powerful idea in the history of the world [beats] in the hearts of the people of this country. It beats in all our hearts no matter your race or ethnicity; no matter your gender identity or sexual orientation -- (applause); no matter your disability; no matter your faith. It beats in the hearts of rich and poor alike.
It unites America whether your ancestors were native to this land or brought here forcibly and enslaved; whether you were immigrants from generations back -- like my family that came from Ireland -- or you're coming here today looking to build a better life for your family, like our fellow Americans I just swore in, in the White House, two days ago. (Applause.)
The American creed -- we use that phrase, ""the American creed"" -- is we're all equal, created equal. It was written a long time ago. But the genius is that every generation of Americans has expanded it wider and wider to include those who were exc- -- excluded before. That's why it's never gathered dust in our history books. It's still alive today -- alive in our hearts; alive in the work of our hands; alive not only in the history we read, but in the history we're making.
My fellow Americans, now we're the guardians of that very idea of America. It's up to us to save it, to preserve it, to build on it, and I know we will. (Applause.)
On this sacred day, I look out to those monuments on our National Mall and beyond them, into the hearts of our people across the land, and I know this: It's never, ever been a good bet to bet against America -- never. (Applause.)
We just have to remember who we are: We are the United States of America, and there's nothing -- nothing we can't do if we do it together. (Applause.)
Folks, happy Fourth of July, America. (Applause.) God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)",NA,"Joseph R.

2-Jul-21,Remarks at the 2021 National Education Association Annual Meeting,"THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everyone. They tell me there are a few people out there watching. (Laughter.)
MS. PRINGLE: A couple thousand.
THE PRESIDENT: A couple thousand.
But, look, before I begin my formal comments, as Jill and your president spoke, it reminded me of two things. One is that because of your help, because we were able to pass the American Rescue Plan, we're able to get millions of shots in people's arms and provide vaccines around the world and change the circumstances.
This week -- this Friday -- they announced the new employment figures. Another 800-and-some-thousand jobs created this week. We've now created more jobs since you got me sworn in than any president in American history in the same timeframe.
We are in a situation where we are doing things that I think are going to fundamentally change the trajectory of this country. I told you a long time ago: It's not just the NEA and unions; it's about building America from the middle up and the middle out, not trickling down. There's a lot -- a lot we can do. A lot more we can do.
And, folks, you know, the projected growth rate, before we started -- I just was doing this earlier this morning -- was to be half of what it is now. It's expected to be over 7.2 percent the economy is going to grow this year. That means thousands and thousands and thousands and millions of jobs. And we're just getting started.
So I want to thank you, Madam President, and congratulate you on your first representative assembly of the NEA. (Applause.)
And Jill and I wanted to congratulate you all on the 100th anniversary of this convening. And notwithstanding rumors, I was not at the first convening. (Laughter.)
The NEA is one of America's indispensable organizations. I'm not just saying that because the First Lady is a member. And, by the way, I noticed -- I noticed that what you all -- I knew what you all were going through. Jill taught full-time this semester. Full-time. I watched Jill getting ready to teach her classes.
And going back to school herself, learning how to work online -- and rapidly work online -- and to teach online, it gave me an appreciation firsthand that I thought I had, but I wouldn't have had had I not seen it. And then going out and teaching -- she was working four or five hours a day, getting ready to teach, putting her lesson plans together a different -- a different way.
And you all went through that. All of you went through that.
And again, I'm not saying this because of something Jill -- you know, I would -- the truth: If I didn't support the NEA, I'd be sleeping in the Lincoln Bedroom alone. But -- and that's not where we sleep. We don't sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom. (Laughs.) I'd be sent down to it.
But, you know, look, as Jill always says: Teaching is not what she does, it's who she is. It's who all of you are. Our children are the kite strings upon which our national ambitions are lifted aloft. And your profession -- your profession helps them believe they can do anything.
For that, and so much more, we just wanted to thank you. Thank you all for what you do and what you continue to do.
And, President Pringle, you and I have something in common: We both took our current roles at a time of incredible challenge and incredible opportunity.
Over the last year, the entire country has witnessed the extraordinary dedication and resolve of the NEA members -- teachers, professionals, who had to be not just educators, but tech support, social workers, often while trying to take care of their own children.
Other public employees who kept vital services up and running. I saw the bus drivers dropping off meals instead of picking up kids. Support staff had to become sanitation experts, making sure school buildings were safe. And tech experts making sure everyone could connect to the Internet from home.
You know, there's been so much heroic work to help children stay connected to school and to each other. The American people saw it. They get it. And they understand what you've been saying for years: that you are professionals, all of you. All of you. All of us have a responsibility to make sure that you have what you need to educate our children safely, equitably, and well.
That's why I made it a priority to get educators vaccinated and reopen schools as quickly as possible. Nationwide, 84 percent of K-through-12 educators and school staff are fully vaccinated, and they were by the end of May. Even more have gotten the vaccination since -- the vaccine since.
But as I've said many times, it's not enough just to get back to normal. We have to build back better than ever, especially our education system.
That's why the American Rescue Plan made such historic investments. It was $1.9 trillion, and people said we could never get it passed. With your help, we did, and we transformed the country -- began to transform the country -- providing funding for state and local governors and school districts to make sure schools are safe and to keep you on the job and in the classrooms. Funding for summer learning and tutoring programs and hiring nurses and counselors.
Now we have an opportunity to make the game-changing investments for educators, students, and families, and make it even better.
We're in a competition in the 21st century -- a worldwide competition. And as Jill says often, ""Any country that out-educates us is going to out-compete us."" We have to build for the 21st century because the rest of the world is not sitting around and waiting.
The bipartisan infrastructure agreement we just reached is going to deliver reliable high-speed Internet to every American. Every single American. And they're going to be affordable, in rural and in urban areas.
Of the many things -- of the many tough images this past year were children sitting in cars in fast-food parking lots because it was the only place they could get a Wi-Fi connection for remote schooling.
If we didn't know -- if we didn't know it before, we do now: High-speed Internet is essential like electric and clean air -- like electricity and clean water.
And speaking of clean water, this agreement that we put together will put Americans to work in good-paying union jobs, replacing 100 percent of lead water pipes in this country. One hundred percent.
Right now, there are 400,000 schools -- and some of you teach in them -- 400,000 schools and childcare centers with lead pipes. We know even that low levels of lead can cause behavior and learning problems in children, impairing their growth.
This deal contains the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history. It would end the threat of lead-contamination -- contaminated water once and for all.
My American Families Plan -- which we're now trying to get done as well -- calls for an historic investment in human infrastructure; guaranteeing four additional years of public education for everyone, starting as early as we can; universal high-quality preschool for three- and four-year-olds. And all the data shows how that increases their prospect, no matter what environment they come from, to do better and make it through school. Two years of free community college. And high-quality, affordable childcare for working families.
It would no longer cost -- excuse me, it would lower the cost of lower-income -- for lower-income students going to school -- the Pell grants. We'd provide an additional mil- -- 1.5 -- $1,500 in Pell grants.
It will also make a $9 billion investment in educators so we can address teacher shortages, diversify our pipeline of teachers, and improve teacher training and teacher mentoring. And, critically, it would extend and expanded the Child Tax Credit, which will significantly benefit working families.
What that means: Instead of deducting $2,000 per child off the bottom line of your taxes, --which doesn't do too much for families who don't have a big tax bill to begin with -- pretty soon, before this month is out, families are going to get a significant check. For every child under the age of six, you'll get $3,600 per child. For every child 6 to 17, you'll get $3,000 -- not as a credit against your taxes that a lot of educators and school staff aren't really going to feel. You'll get cash. Cash.
Starting the middle of this month, you'll start to get monthly payments between now and the end of the year. For example, if you have one child, and you're going to get -- you're going to get $3,600. Between now and January, you'll get $1,800 of that on a monthly basis between now and January. And between January and December, you'll get the other $1,800.
Folks, this is a major tax break for working families, and my family plan will extend it for five years. The very -- this year's plan is estimated to cut child poverty in half. In half. The Child Tax Care [Credit].
So, look, folks -- (applause) -- I'm also working with Congress to support $100 billion in school infrastructure investments, making sure that our schools are safe, that you have the technology you need to prepare for students of the future -- something that I've always cared deeply about.
My budget invests $20 billion more in Title I schools. No student -- no student's education should depend on their ZIP code. It would represent a historic effort to close the funding gap between rich and poor districts.
And one of the first things that funding will be used for is to help educators in those schools get the raises they deserve and the resources they need. (Applause.)
And, by the way, if I'd note, this isn't just -- it's not that I'm trying to be nice. This is absolutely necessary -- necessary if we're going to compete in the 21st century. Think about it: The idea that we have a large portion of our student population living in ZIP codes where they cannot afford the kind of education and can't pay the teachers enough in those schools to educate them, it makes no sense. The people that are going to benefit the most from this is corporate America and businesses because they're going to have a better-educated public, better-educated students.
Your union and teachers' protests across the country made it clear that you deserve more than praise. You deserve a raise, not just praise. (Applause.)
And, folks, every parent in this country who spent the last year helping educate their children at home understand you deserve a raise. (Applause.) They figured it out. (Applause.) No, I'm serious. Think about it. Think about it.
It was the ultimate education of the public going through this pandemic.
My budget would also allow us to invest more in counselors, social workers, community schools, nutrition support, and a whole lot more. (Applause.)
I have a lot more to say, but I'm going to get the hook from Jill if I keep talking. (Laughter.)
No, but let's -- so let me close with this: On Sunday, we'll celebrate our independence as a nation, as well as our progress against the virus. In the days ahead, we have a chance to make another beginning -- the beginning of a stronger, fairer education system. But it can't be done -- it can't be done with you. We can't do it alone. We need to keep getting the word out about the opportunities that lies ahead for us.
So, let's make this happen together. I really mean this. This is a -- this is a campaign in and of itself. Jill and I are proud of you. We're grateful to you. And I really mean that.
You know, I think about it: Why would a kid like me, from Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, be standing here as your President of the United States of America, were it not for the people who educated me, the teachers I had? It made a difference. They took a stuttering kid who couldn't -- couldn't -- couldn't -- couldn't speak very well in school, was scared to death to be called on to read out loud.
And they nurtured me: ""Joey -- you're a very smart boy, Joey. Just take your time. Don't let that get in your way, Joey."" I'm serious. I think what you all underestimate, beyond the teaching of reading and writing, adding and subtracting: You give so many kids confidence.
You let them believe in themselves. I'm not joking. Think about yourself, your own -- you can name the teachers who helped change your life. You can name them. I can still name them. I know who the -- the people who made a difference in my life, made me believe I could do anything. When, if you looked at the background, there's no reason why, coming from my circumstance. We weren't -- it wasn't poverty, just -- just making it. But you did it, and don't forget it. Don't forget how much difference you make.
Those of you who've been teaching a while, you have experiences like Jill has. People will come up to Jill and say, ""Mrs. Biden, you had -- I had your English class. I can't thank you…"" ""What are you doing now?"" ""Well, I have my doctorate, and I'm teaching at such and such."" Or a fireman putting out a fire in our home: ""Mrs. Biden…"" -- as his gear coming out of a house that almost burned down -- ""Mrs. Biden, you had me. You had me as a teacher, and you taught me English."" Think of the people's lives you change.
You know, I'm supposed to stop but I'm going to say a couple more things -- (laughter) -- because I -- I really don't think you understand or you appreciate just how important you are. I really mean it. I genuinely mean it from the bottom of my heart.
I was overseas at what they call the G7 -- the biggest economies in the world -- and then with the NATO people, and then I met with Putin. And in the process of doing all of this, I was asked at one point, ""Can you define America for me?"" And I give you my word to this. I said, ""Yes…"" -- and I believe this, and I repeated it again today as I swore in new citizens, young people in the White House. I said, ""I can define America"" -- and I mean it from the bottom of my heart -- ""in one word: possibilities."" It's the only nation in the world where we think we can do anything.
Now, why do we think that? Not a joke. Why do we think that? Why do we think anything is possible? It's not just the system. It's the people who look out for us.
I've said a hundred times, you control -- you, the teachers, determine what this country is going to look like. You are the people who take our children and nurture them. As I said many times, they're the kite string -- you're the kite strings upon which we lift our national ambitions aloft. So, have -- understand how important you are.
And, by the way, understand how important that cafeteria worker is who looks at that kid who's a little bit ashamed that they have no food at home and says, ""Honey, here. Here is a little more. Take some more."" Or packs a little bag without telling them after they have lunch and slips it to them. You provide their dignity. You give them dignity.
So, I really mean it: I think you're the single most important component of America's future. So don't give up on yourselves, and I know you won't. Don't give up on these kids. Give them hope. Make them believe in themselves. And make sure when they're much older, and they say, ""How'd you get here?"" ""Because Mrs. Jones or Mr. Williams,"" or whomever. Because it will be done. It will be done.
Thank you. Thank you for all you do, all you give, and all that you are to your students and to the nation. You know you affect your students, but it's to the nation.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much. (Applause.)",NA,"Joseph R.

2-Jul-21,Remarks in a Naturalization Ceremony with Essential Workers and Military Service Members,"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. (Applause.) Please, please be seated.
Before I begin, any family of the people who just got sworn in here today? If you are, stand up. Congratulations to you all as well. Congratulations. Congratulations. It's a good day, isn't it?
All right. You get to -- and, by the way, if you're around on Sunday, we're going to -- you'll see the fireworks -- Fourth of July, our Independence Day. (Laughter.)
Mr. Secretary, thank you for administering the oath. I know how meaningful this event is to you personally and professionally. And I thank you and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Tracy -- where is Tracy? She -- there you go, Tracy. Thank you very much -- appreciate it -- for joining us in this service.
Look, today -- today's special guests -- to all of you: It is my honor to congratulate the 21 of you for -- who earned the title of -- that our democracy, in every -- is equal to being President -- it's of the same consequence: citizen -- citizen of the United States of America.
You have each come to America from different circumstances and different reasons and 16 different nationalities.
But like previous generations of immigrants, there is one trait you all share in common: courage. It takes courage to get up and leave everything you know and go to another place, no matter where it is. You know, the only homes you've ever known, the lives, the loved ones who weren't able to come -- for a new start in the United States of America.
If I could hold a second and just point out that I -- I'm often asked by -- by world leaders that I'm with, particularly autocrats: How can I define America?
I was with Xi Jinping in -- on the Tibetan Plateau, and he asked me that when I traveled with him 17,000 miles. And it was a private meeting -- just he and I and a contemporaneous translator. He said, ""Can you define America for me?"" I said, ""Yeah, I can, in one word -- one word: possibilities."" Possibilities. It's what America is built on. It's one of the reasons why we're viewed sometimes as being somewhat egotistical. We believe anything is possible in America. Anything is possible in America.
I think about my own family's journey here -- at least two thirds of it came from -- got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, back in 1849, having no idea whether they'd make it across the Atlantic to the United States, then to the col- -- to the United States of America, but certain if they did, they could do better. And they did. They did better, and they eventually built a life and raised a family in Scranton, Pennsylvania, over generations.
And here I stand on the shoulders and sacrifices of my great-great-grandfather, my great-grandfather, my -- and just all that they did because they believed -- they believed like you believe: Anything is possible.
So I want to thank you all for choosing us, and I mean that sincerely. Thank you for choosing the United States of America, believing that America is worthy of your aspirations, worthy of your dreams.
Making this journey, you have done more than move to a new place. I've often said that America is the only nation in the world founded on an idea. Every other nation in the world is founded on the basis of either that -- geography or ethnicity or religion. You can define every -- almost everyone else based on those characteristics, but you can't define America. I defy you to tell me what constitutes an American. You can't do it. We're an incredibly diverse democracy.
But there is one thing that does define us a country: We were founded on an idea that, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men [and women] are created equal…endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights…Life, Liberty, [and] the pursuit of Happiness."" It sounds corny to Americans, as we learn this in grade school and high school. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never, ever, ever walked away from it. Every generation opens that aperture a little bit wider.
You know, they go back -- as I said, since our nation's founding, the quintessential idea in America has been nurtured and enriched and advanced by the contributions and sacrifices of so many people -- almost all of whom were immigrants. Native Americans were, in fact, the only people who were here -- only people who were here.
And so, folks, you know, it's dreams of immigrants like you that built America and continue to inject new energy, new vitality, new -- new strength. We've seen that most clearly during this pandemic, with immigrants as frontline workers and as scientists and researchers on the frontlines of finding vaccines.
Another defining moment of our nation in the past year was NASA landing Perseverance Rover on Mars, flying the Ingenuity helicopter above its surface as I talked to them -- what is considered a sort of outer-space Wright brothers moment.
I spoke to the team about this historic mission while it was underway, which includes immigrants. The team was made up of immigrants who told me they grew up looking at the stars -- literally, not a joke; I'm not making this up. That's what they told me in our conversation. Looking at the stars and believing only America could take them there. Well -- and we see it each and every single day.
Folks, among you are six members of the United States military. I ask you all to please stand. Thank you, thank you, thank you for service (inaudible). (Applause.) Thank you.
Folks -- please sit. Please sit down.
I was telling our new citizens, in the other room before we came in, that one of my most -- I don't know how to say it -- fulfilling moments was, as Vice President, when I went over to Saddam Hussein's god-awful, gaudy palace. And there were, I think, 167 men and women in uniform standing in that palace. As my wife who -- I think, I'm not sure of this -- may be the only First Lady or Second Lady to go into a warzone -- an active war zone. She was with me, and we both stood there as I was able to swear in every one of those military officers as U.S. citizens.
And I thought to myself -- I thought to myself, ""What incredible justification for all the things that Saddam didn't believe in."" And they stood -- and there were a number there who had won Silver Stars -- not -- like you, not citizens when you join -- won Silver Stars, Bronze Stars, Conspicuous Service Medals, Purple Hearts. And I got to swear them in in the palace of a dictator.
Also among this incredible group that's here are healthcare workers and frontline workers who went above and beyond the call in the fight against COVID-19. They did so in hospitals and clinics, at our National Institute of Health -- the NIH -- at restaurants and retailers, as educators also in our schools. I want to thank you all for risking your lives to help others keep their country and our country going.
And joining you today are your families. And I want you to know and understand that this is your day as well. I can only imagine the pride you must feel. Pride in where you come from, in who you are, in the lives you've built together as America -- in America, and the communities that make you stronger, make us stronger.
All of you represent how immigration has always been essential to America. We're constantly renewing ourselves. Constantly. When we come out of this pandemic and build an economy, we're going to build it back better. If we're going to do that, we need to fix our immigration system and fully tap the talent and dynamism in our nation.
I've kept my commitment and sent an immigration reform bill to the United States Congress. It includes smart border management and security and a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people in America.
With Vice President Harris's leadership, we're getting at the root causes of why people are migrating for our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in the first place: the violence; the corruption; the gangs; the political instability; the hungry -- the natural -- the hunger; the natural disasters.
And I've made it clear that we can work together on other critical issues as well: a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers -- the young people who have only known America as their home; a pathway for immigrants who are here on temporary protective status -- TPS -- who came from countries beset by manmade and natural-made violence and disaster; and a pathway for farmworkers who are here putting food on our tables but are not citizens.
Folks, in the competition for the 21st century, we need an immigration system that both reflects our values and upholds our laws. We can do both.
I'll close with this: No matter where you come from or the culture that has made us, the language we speak, or the faith we follow, one of the most basic acts of respect is inviting others into your home.
You know, as we close out Immigration Heritage Month and start our nation's Fourth of July weekend, I can think of no better way to honor each occasion than by welcoming all of you into the White House -- the People's House -- I might add, designed by an Irishman -- (laughter) -- for real -- in a nation shaped by the immigrant's heart.
I look forward to standing with you as you embrace your new rights and responsibilities as American citizens, and as generations have done before you.
So, welcome, my fellow Americans.
Now, before we take the Pledge of Allegiance together,
I'd like to invite one guest, Sandra Lindsay, to please come up onstage. (Applause.)
Sandra immigrated to Queens, New York, from Jamaica when she was 18 years old. And over the past -- I don't believe this -- 30 years -- she doesn't look 30 years old -- (laughter) -- she's pursued her dream of becoming a nurse to allow her to do what she wanted to do most: give back to her new country.
She earned a bachelor's degree, then a master's degree, then a doctorate degree, and her citizenship. And now she's Director of Nursing for Critical Care at a hospital on Long Island.
And during the height of the pandemic, she poured her heart and soul into her work to help patients fight for their lives and to keep her fellow nurses safe.
With a grandson at home -- prematurely -- she did what she had to do: She kept her distance and kept him safe. He is safe, but she lost an aunt and an uncle to the virus.
But in her pain, she didn't lose hope. When the time came, she was the first person in America to get fully vaccinated outside of clinical trials. She can now hug her grandson. She's out there making sure her patients and folks in her community are getting vaccinated so they can get back to their lives and their loved ones.
Sandra, if there are any angels in Heaven -- as I told you, having spent a lot of time in the ICU -- they're all nurses, male and female. Doctors let you live; nurses make you want to live. Make you want to live -- for real.
Sandra's vaccination card and hospital scrubs and the badge that was -- she wore will be included in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History exhibit on COVID-19. (Applause.)
And today, she's receiving the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' Outstanding Americans by Choice Recognition, which recognizes the naturalized citizens who have made significant contributions to our country through civic participation, professional achievement, and responsible citizenship.
Sandra, thank you for representing the very best of all of us. Thank you all in this room. Thank you, again. This is America.
Happy Fourth of July. May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)",NA,"Joseph R.

2-Jul-21,Remarks Honoring the 2020 World Series Champion Los Angeles Dodgers,"THE PRESIDENT: Well, good afternoon, everyone. It's a great beginning of the Fourth of July weekend. Madam Vice President. Mr. Leader, how are you? Good to see you.
We're here today to congratulate a group of folks who did pretty well. Welcome to the White House. I have a feeling, Kamala, I think we may be doing this again by the end of the year. (Laughter.) I don't know, man. I'm not sure I'll be able to handle Garcetti if you win twice. (Laughter.) I mean, it's going to be hard -- really hard.
But the 2020 World Series Champions, the Los Angeles Dodgers, are here. (Applause.) We are honored and thrilled they're here.
And that goes for the Vice President, too. She's from California, you probably heard. I'm not going to mention which end of the state she's from right now -- (laughter) -- and who she roots for, but -- is Doug here?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He was with them last night.
THE PRESIDENT: I know he was. I thought he may --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Came home wearing his jersey. (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT: I tell you what -- well, you know, we have -- you know, when you talk about mixed families, I got a mixed family and she's got a mixed family, based on baseball -- (laughter) -- and sports. I'm not going to mention that team in northern California, in the San Francisco area. And I'm not going to mention that team in Philadelphia. (Laughter.) My wife is a Philly girl from her belt buckle to her shoe soles. And if -- if I root for anybody but the Phillies, I'll be sleeping in the Lincoln Bedroom alone. (Laughter.) But it's, you know, sometimes -- well, no, never. But at any rate --
But the Dodgers are a lot more than a baseball club. They really are. They're a pillar of American culture and American progress. And that's for real.
The team that brought us the voice of Vin Scully and Sandy -- the arm of Sandy Koufax and Fernando Valenzuela -- and I was talking with staff and they said, ""I want to teach you how to pronounce that name."" I said, ""I watched him pitch."" (Laughter.) But I'm only 37. (Laughter.) But it's -- I wish -- anyway, above all else, the heart of Jackie Robinson.
Now, you're building a new dynasty for a new generation. And I've often said that it's never a good idea to bet against the American people; I tell that to every world leader I encounter.
Well, now we know it's never a good idea to bet against Mookie. And Mookie is a hell of a ballplayer, but -- and a guy who used to love Mookie is my Chief Strategist, Mike Donilon. But he doesn't want to talk to Mookie anymore. (Laughter.) Mookie left Boston, and this is a Boston fan. I mean, you know, there's nothing like dividing staffs based on baseball.
But, folks, it's not a good idea to bet against Clayton either, you know, or Cody.
You know, this is -- this is a world championship organization because they've got a team full of guys who stepped up when they were called upon. Just stepped up.
And it takes a team to finish with the best record in baseball -- to knock out the Brewers, the Padres, the Braves, the Rays -- and win it all. And the Dodgers just didn't win. You finished with the highest winning percentage of any team since 1954. (Applause.) Think about that: the winningest ball club since 1954.
You know, it takes a team to persevere through one of the most challenging seasons and one of the most challenging years
in our nation's history.
In the pandemic, when it struck, it upended just about everything -- every part of American life. Families were grieving for loved ones lost. The economy collapsed. And the pain and fear in the nation were immeasurable.
And when the season began, it was easy to feel like it was -- they had bigger things to worry about than just sports. And, of course, we did and we still do. But I think what we discovered is that we need sports more than we ever realized. We s- -- we see it now as fans return to ballparks and arenas all across the country, cheering on their favorite players and teams, sharing that sense of community and pride. It's a uniting feature, as I said to you guys in the other room.
And when we go through a crisis, very often sports brings us together to heal, to help us feel like things are going to be okay, they're going to get better. For a few hours each day, feeling and sensing and experiencing something familiar, something normal, something that's fun in the middle of the chaos, and believing that we're going to get back to all that we're missing and we're going to get back to it someday soon.
So today, we celebrate your incredible achievement. We celebrate the great work you do on and off the field, in the community, and on childhood literacy, preventing bullying, and so much more.
For the way this team is built and from the way it's built, I suspect we have -- we have many of you, as I said, maybe back visiting soon.
Above all, as we beat this pandemic and celebrate fans coming back to stadiums, we celebrate something else: a national achievement. We came together, as fellow Americans -- frontline workers, friends, families, neighbors -- looking out for one another. And Dodger Stadium was the heart of that effort -- I want to thank the ownership for that -- the heart of the effort, administering more than 1 million COVID tests at the stadium and getting nearly a half million vaccine doses in people's arms.
Dodgers also helped us come together by being the first team in baseball to make their stadium available to voting -- as distanced, outdoor vote centers during the last election.
So not only does Dodger Stadium hosts world champions, it helped save lives and strengthen our democracy as well.
Together, as a nation, we have proved that it truly is never a good bet to bet against America. America is back, and the Dodgers are back.
So, congratulations to all of you and the best of luck the rest of the season. May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. (Applause.)
Now -- now let's bring up a three-time Cy Young Award winner, Clayton Kershaw, to say a few words and maybe throw a few curveballs. (Laughter.) Okay. Come on up, man. (Applause.)
MR. KERSHAW: Hi, everybody. First time to speak at the White House, so sorry if I'm a little nervous. (Laughter.) But, Mr. President, thank you for having us. It's an honor to be here and get to celebrate our World Series victory here at the White House.
Last season was a special one for us, but it was also a challenging one for our country. And our hope was that we were able to provide just a little bit of joy and comfort and relief to our fans that were going through some tough times.
This season, it's been incredible to have fans back in the ballpark. We missed their energy and their passion for the game. And it means so much to us that people are coming back to the ballpark and things around the country are going back to normal. Hopefully, like you said, we can come visit again next year.
So, with that, we brought something for you and the Vice President. And now our team owner, Mark Walter, is going to bring that down for you.
(The President is presented with a Dodgers jersey.) (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT: I have to show you I'm a man of courage. (Laughter.)
Well, thank you very much. What a -- what a lovely -- what a great honor. Thank you.
MR. KERSHAW: I think Doc is going to come up now and present to Madam Vice President. (Applause.)
(The Vice President is presented with a Dodgers jersey.) (Applause.)
MR. ROBERTS: Madam Vice President, this is your jersey.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I needed it. (Laughter.) (Applause.) Thank you all. Thank you. Thanks, guys.
MR. ROBERTS: That blue looks very good on you. (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT: Hold it up.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: There you go.
THE PRESIDENT: All right. Okay.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
MR. KERSHAW: Thank you so much for having us.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, man.
MR. KERSHAW: Appreciate it. Thank you. (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT: All right. You're going to take this down, I know, in a minute, but hang on a second.
Folks, you know, I think even the Americans who aren't baseball fans, they -- there's an awful lot of baseball metaphors and an awful lot that we -- we -- it creeps into every part of our language and our culture. And it has been one of the great equalizers.
What -- come on up here, Madam Vice President. What the Vice President and I have spent a lot of time working on making sure we do is deal with the equity in the United States.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: Making sure that we change the dynamic in a fundamental way. That, you know, we are the only nation in the world based -- organized, based on an idea. Ever na- -- every other nation is based on a notion of culture or geography or religion. We're the only one based on an idea. Not a joke.
And the idea is, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men [and women] are created equal… endowed by their Creator."" That's who we are. And we decided this is a time to push that forward.
Look what baseball has done. Look what baseball has done. Look at -- look -- the makeup of this ballclub and the makeup of the ballclubs all across the league. I really mean that. It's gigantic. Look at who's managing this club. You know, I mean, it's -- so it matters. And you send a message that is profound.
Now I'm going to mention one ballplayer that the Vice President heard me mentioned before, that I -- even I never -- and I -- even I'm not old enough to have watched him play -- but Satchel Paige.
And Satchel Paige, as any pitcher out here can tell you -- the older you get, the harder to keep that arm going. Right? Well, he didn't get to the majors until he was 45 years old. On his 47th birthday -- I know you all know this -- he pitched a win against Chicago. And all the press went into his room, and -- in the locker room, and said, ""Satch, Satch, it's amazing: 47 years old and you pitched a win. How do you feel about being 47, Satch?"" He said, ""Boys, that's not how I look at age."" I had the staff look this up. This is what he did say: ""That's not how I look at age."" ""Then how do you look at it, Satch?"" ""I look at this way"" -- he said, ""How old would you be if you didn't know how old you were?"" (Laughter.) I am 51 years old. (Laughter.) You guys are 19. (Laughter.)
Anyway, I think you real- -- I know you don't underestimate it anymore. You saw what happened in other professional leagues and the way you and all the leagues responded to the crisis we faced. So thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
And I -- I just want you to know that there -- we have a congressional baseball game every year. In the very beginning, I used to be a centerfielder and my Walter Mitty dream -- anyways, it's a long story, but -- (laughter) --
And my kids only remember two things that ever happened to me in my career -- my boys. And they've met kings and queens, they've gone to other countries. But I played, when the first -- the second congressional baseball game at the old stadium -- the old Washington stadium. And I hit one off the right-centerfield wall. It bounced off the wall. I think it's 368 or -- I don't know what is exactly now -- but off the wall. And I'm rounding -- anyway, to make a long story short, my kids remember that, all the rest. And guess what? The only thing I remember, too. (Laughter.) Here I thought: What could have been. What could have been.
But at any rate. And I'm with Cedric Richmond, who is a congressman, a hell of an athlete, pitched in college. And he -- we're both hoping that somehow -- he would do it based on merit; I'm hoping that because I got elected President, I may do it on influence -- to be invi- -- (laughter) -- to be inducted into the -- the Congressional Baseball Hall of Fame. (Laughter.) You all think I'm kidding, don't you? (Laughter.) No.
Anyway, so thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I just want you to know, it really means a lot to us that you're here. It means a lot that -- and the kind of hope you give the American people. Don't underestimate it, guys. Don't underestimate it.",NA,"Joseph R. Biden, Remarks Honoring the 2020 World Series Champion Los Angeles Dodgers Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

2-Jul-21,Remarks on the June Jobs Report and an Exchange with Reporters,"THE PRESIDENT: Good morning, everyone. It is a good morning. (Laughs.) It's a good morning. As we get prepared to celebrate Independence Day, today's job news brought us something else to celebrate. This morning we learned that, in June, our economy created 850,000 jobs. Eight hundred and fifty thousand jobs. Wages went up for American workers.
Since I took office, our recovery [economy] has created an average of 600,000 dollar -- six- -- ""dollars."" (Laughs.) I wish they -- they probably wish there was 600,000 jobs that paid $600,000 a year. But 600,000 jobs per month. We have now created over 3 million jobs since I took office -- more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history, thanks to the incredible work of the entire team.
This is historic progress pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic, as well as other elements of the American Rescue Plan.
Today, the U.S. is the only major advanced economy where the OECD projections of future output are higher today than they were in January 2020, before the pandemic hit. And America was ranked first in Bloomberg's ""COVID Resilience Ranking."" None of this happened by accident. Again, it's a direct result of the American Rescue Plan. And at the time, people questioned whether or not we should do that, even though we didn't have bipartisan support. Well, it worked.
In February, the Congressional Budget Office projected 2021 economic growth would be 3.7 percent. Yesterday, they doubled that number to 7.4 percent, in large part thanks to the American Rescue Plan and our work to defeat the virus.
The last time the economy grew at this rate was in 1984, and Ronald Reagan was telling us it's ""morning in America."" Well, it's getting close to afternoon here. The sun is coming out. At the time, the CBO revised their long-run deficit projections down as a share of GDP they -- just as they have done.
So, the American Rescue Plan is strengthening our financial position, and it grows our economy. It's continuing to grow our economy. And the strength of our recovery is helping us flip the script.
Instead of workers competing with each other for jobs that are scarce, employers are competing with each other to attract workers. That kind of competition in the market doesn't just give workers more ability to earn higher wages; it also gives them the power to demand to be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace.
More jobs, better wages -- that's a good combination. Put simply: Our economy is on the move, and we have COVID-19 on the run.
Yes, we have more work to do to get America vaccinated and everyone back to work. We are aiming for full employment, and that means keeping our pace on job growth, including for Black, Hispanic, and Asian workers.
But this progress is testament to our commitment to grow this economy from the bottom up and the middle out. The American Rescue Plan provided resources to get shots in people's arms and checks in people's pockets. Schools -- schools were struggling to reopen so we made vaccinating teachers a priority, getting schools much-needed support.
In March, we've added -- just in the month of [since] March, we added 364,000 education jobs and roles. Small businesses and restaurants were getting crushed. Now we're delivering the loans and support they need to reopen and to stay open.
This morning, we've learned that jobs in some hard-hit sectors -- such as restaurants, hotels, amusement parks -- were up by 343,000 last month; over 1.5 million over the past five months. And more help is on the way to give families just a little bit more breathing room.
Starting this month, families are going to receiving one of the largest-ever, single-year tax cuts that middle-class families have ever received, and it's called the Child Care Tax Credit.
And here's how it works: In the past, if you paid taxes and had a good income, you could deduct $2,000 per child, and that would come off the total amount of taxes you owe. If you had two children, you owed $10,000; you take off $4,000.
In the American Rescue Plan, we expanded that. Now a parent would get $3,600 for each child under the age of six, and $3,000 for dependents they had between the ages of 6 and 17. So instead of just being a credit against your taxes you owe, it's now a fully refundable credit, half of which will get paid out in monthly basis.
Look, what that means is: This year, middle-class families with two young children can expect to get -- receive $7,200 in a rebate, in effect -- a tax return -- with the monthly payments of $600 a month starting this month, until it's paid out.
Eight out of every ten families who use direct deposit will get their refunds. They'll be able to get a monthly payment on the 15th of every month from now until the end of the year, so they get that paid out. Help with families most need it -- most need help to make ends meet. It's important.
And I've said it for a long time: It's time to give ordinary folks, ordinary Americans, middle-class and working-class Americans a tax break. This is the type of tax cut that can help our economy because it will go to families who are going to spend it.
It will also help lead a historic reduction in child poverty -- excuse me -- (the President takes a drink of water) -- historic reduction in child poverty, which would have long-term benefits for our economy.
And we're delivering $39 billion to help childcare providers serve more families, to help parents, particularly women, get back to work.
Last month, our economy added nearly 25,000 childcare jobs. Again, none of this happened by accident. We're providing -- proving to the naysayers and the doubters that they were wrong.
None of this is guaranteed to continue, though, unless we finish our work. Now is the time to accelerate the progress we've been making. Now is the time to build in a long-term foundation that we've laid, and build it in for a long term. Economists of all stripes agree that my plan will create good jobs and drastically strengthen our economy in the long run.
So we have to continue to make the investments that will allow our economy to build back better and deal everyone in. We took a significant step in that direction last week when the bipartisan group of senators forged an agreement with me to move forward on key portions of my American Jobs Plan.
It was -- I just in Wisconsin, where I highlighted how this agreement is going to pave the way for a generational investment to modernize our infrastructure; create millions of jobs, according to the experts; and what that will mean an ever- -- and it won't just be in the center cities. It will be every corner of the state and our nation.
We're going to create jobs repairing roads and bridges, replacing 100 percent of our nation's lead water pipes, making our power grid more reliable, delivering high-speed Internet to every American home, rural and urban.
We're going to put people to work building a nationwide electric vehicle charging network, transitioning from diesel school buses and transit buses to electric buses, and bringing in world-class rail service to more Americans by reducing -- and, in the process, reduce our carbon footprint.
For example, when I was up in Wisconsin, I said -- I pointed out -- the governor was there. I said, ""Gov, I know it takes…"" -- or I don't know how many people -- a couple hundred people, I guess, in the audience. I said, ""It takes, they tell me, four and half hours to drive from here to Chicago. With the money we have in -- for mass transit here, we -- you're going to be able to do that in two and half hours."" And all the data shows that when it's easier to get someplace by rail than by automobile, it's cheaper and it generates a whole lot less carbon footprint.
We're going to create good-paying union jobs capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells to stop methane leaks, which are devastating, and to protect the health of our communities. These are good jobs.
Taken together, these investments are going to position America to compete with the world and win the 21st century.
You know, as we bring home key parts of my American Jobs Plan, I'm going to make the case for equally critical investments that we still need, including those in which I introduced at the same time: my American Families Plan.
When I was running for President, I put together a bold, aggressive plan to deliver childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K for three- and four-year-olds, free community college. Maybe the most important among them was extending the expanded Child Care Tax Credit I just mentioned for another five years, which will significantly benefit middle-class and working-class families.
That human infrastructure is as essential as our physical infrastructure. It's going to help us create more good jobs, ease the burden on working families, and strengthen our economy -- strengthen it in the long run.
These investments are critical. And as the plans I put forward tackle our climate crisis, which are broad and deep, I'm going to fight to see them enacted and signed into law. We have a chance to seize this economic momentum of the first months of my administration, not just to build back, but as I've been saying, ""build back better.""
This is much already -- this much is already clear: We're on the right track and we're on the right track. Our plan is working. And we're not going to let up now.
So I want to thank everyone. I wish you all a happy Fourth of July. We're going to be able to go to ballgames. You're going to be able to sit in the stadiums. You're going to be able to be with your families in backyard barbeques, as we hoped. And we're going to make more progress.
So, God bless America. And may God protect our troops.
Q: Could you talk to us about Afghanistan? Is the drawdown going to be done in the next few days?
THE PRESIDENT: No.
Q: No?
THE PRESIDENT: No, we're on -- we're on track exactly as to where we expected to be. But we just -- I wanted to make sure there was enough, quote, ""running room"" that we could get -- wouldn't be able to do it all until September. There will still be some forces left. But it's a rational drawdown with our allies, and it's making -- so there's nothing unusual about it.
Q: Are you worried that the Afghan government might fall? I mean, we are hearing about how the Taliban is taking more and more districts.
THE PRESIDENT: Look, we were in that war for 20 years. Twenty years. And I think -- I met with the Afghan government here in the White House, in the Oval. I think they have the capacity to be able to sustain the government. There are going to have to be, down the road, more negotiations, I suspect. But I am -- I am concerned that they deal with the internal issues that they have to be able to generate the kind of support they need nationwide to maintain the government.
Q: A follow on that thought on Afghanistan --
THE PRESIDENT: I want to talk about happy things, man.
Q: If there is evidence that Kabul is threatened, which some of the intelligence reports have suggested it could be in six months or thereabout, do you think you've got the capability to help provide any kind of air support, military support to them to keep the capital safe, even if the U.S. troops are obviously fully out by that time?
THE PRESIDENT: We have worked out an over-the-horizon capacity that we can be value added, but the Afghans are going to have to be able to do it themselves with the Air Force they have, which we're helping them maintain.
Q: Sir, on Afghanistan --
THE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to answer any more quick question on Afghanistan.
Q: Are you concerned --
THE PRESIDENT: Look, it's Fourth of July.
Q: On the economy --
Q: Are you concerned about Fourth of July gatherings --
THE PRESIDENT: I'm concerned that you guys are asking me questions that I'll answer next week. But I'm -- this is a holiday weekend. I'm going to celebrate it. There is great things happening.
The economy is growing faster than any time in 40 years. We've got a record number of new jobs. COVID deaths are down 90 percent. Wages are up faster than any time in 15 years. We're bringing out -- bringing our troops home. We have -- all across America, people are going to ballgames and doing good things. This is good.
I'll be -- I'll answer all your negative questions -- not negative -- your legitimate question.
Q: But with the gatherings, are you concerned that there is a potential, this weekend, in places where vaccination levels are not particularly high, that there will be new COVID outbreaks in various regions of the country?
THE PRESIDENT: I am concerned that people who have not gotten vaccinated have the capacity to catch the variant and spread the variant to other people who have not been vaccinated.
I am not concerned there is going to be a major outbreak -- in other words, that we're going to have another epidemic nationwide, but I am concerned lives will be lost. And I was even reading today there's some speculation and some judgment that's coming out that you may be able to even communicate the vaccine -- the -- the new variant to your pets.
So I say, not -- not totally facetiously, for those of you who haven't been vaccinated because you don't -- you don't -- you don't think it's -- you want to go through it: It doesn't hurt, it's accessible, it's free, it's available. And not only -- don't think about yourself; think about your family. Think about those around you. That's what we should be thinking about today.
The Fourth of July this year is different than the Fourth of July last year. And it's going to be better next year.
Thank you all.
Q: Mr. President, do you think that Congress will enact your plans? Are you confident --
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
Q: -- that you're going to get it done?
THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.)
Q: Come on.
THE PRESIDENT: Come on, guys. Am I co- -- are you -- have you ever been confident about anything with guarantee? Who wants to put money on anything that Congress is going to do? Look, folks, this is a process. This is a process.
I love you guys, but it's a process. And I don't -- you want me to say, ""Yes, I'm absolutely certain."" Well, are you absolutely certain this new commission is going to work, investigating what happened on the 6th? Are you guys confident that Republicans are going to participate?
Look, all I know -- only thing I know what to do -- and I really mean this -- is do my best to lay out what I think the country has to do, try to be as persuasive as I can, and hope. And thus far, you know, it's -- you know, it seems to be working a little bit. So, thank you.",NA,"Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on the June Jobs Report and an Exchange with Reporters Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/350654 ",,,,,,,,,,,
1-Jul-21,"Remarks on the Surfside Residential Building Collapse and an Exchange With Reporters in Miami Beach, Florida","The President. Good afternoon, folks. Let me begin by saying that the degree of cooperation between local, State, and Federal officials down here has been remarkable.
I want to thank our FEMA Director for leading this national effort. But Governor DeSantis, Senators Rubio and Scott, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Mayor Cava—Cava—they've been—they've all cooperated in ways that I haven't seen in a long time. And it's really a testament to what's—how difficult things are down here. And it's what, quite frankly, we miss a lot. You know, we all—we've all been working in tandem from the moment we got the news of the collapse of the building.
And I think my colleagues will tell you we cut through the bureaucracy. The one order I gave the Federal folks was: ""No bureaucracy. Just cut through it. Get to whatever they need."" That's why we've decided to cover, for example, 100 percent of the search-and-rescue costs for the first 30 days. Not done often, but necessary here, in my view.
And FEMA is going to provide temporary housing and other urgent needs for the survivors. The State Department is expediting visas for family members from other countries, and there are from Latin America, South America, Europe, Israel.
And I want to give a special shout-out to the first responders—International Association of Firefighters, one of the best organizations in the country. And I particularly want to thank the president. Ed came down from Boston, and he's here with the entire group.
You know, these folks are—these folks are always showing up, no matter what. They're risking their lives. You know, there's that old expression. I know, the press that travels with me is tired of hearing me saying it, but I'm not tired of saying it. And that is—that old expression—""God made man. Then, he made a few firefighters."" They're remarkable, remarkable people. There's always—they're always risking their lives to save lives, as well as the police and other first responders. I got to meet with a whole bunch of them.
And we are able to deploy nearly 500 personnel, including five other search-and-rescue teams on the ground today here because of—our FEMA Director ordered it. I want to compliment FEMA and, I might add, all those folks who are risking their lives to save lives, but also holding out hope that others will be found. Hope springs eternal.
When I talked to those first responders, I pointed out that they're under a great deal of stress and we should take advantage—they should take advantage of the mental health facilities that are going to be available. Because, you know, we talk about our military suffering from posttraumatic stress. Well, seeing what they're seeing and doing what they're doing, understanding how much trauma is involved, they—I just don't want them thinking that they should walk away from help if it's needed. You know, they stand together, and it's really impressive.
And there's also the need, in addition to State and local assistance, to determine the cause of this collapse and the adjacent buildings, how safe they are. There are two outstanding concerns. First, the remaining buildings may collapse—the remainder of the building may collapse. We need to determine if it's safe for first responders to return to the site to continue their rescue mission.
That's being done right now. And that's why I asked the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, to investigate, to see if it's safe to go back and what caused the building to collapse in the first place. Because we're committed not only to recover, but to restore the safety across the board.
But the other reason I came down was to meet with the families. The whole Nation is mourning with these families. They see it every day on television. They're going through hell. And those who survived the collapse, as well as those who are missing loved ones.
I realize I'm a little late because I spent a lot of time with the families—a whole lot of time. And I apologize for taking so long to get here, because I thought it was important to speak to every single person who wanted to speak to me. So, after what you all covered when I opened up the meeting, I spent the remainder of the time, and I—and such incredible people.
I sat with one woman who had just lost her husband and her little baby boy; didn't know what to do. I sat with another family that lost almost the entire family: cousins, brothers, sisters. And to watch them and to—they're praying and pleading that: ""God, let there be a miracle. Let them be something happen for me that's good.""
Because I have, like many of you do, some idea what it's like to suffer that kind of loss so many of them are suffering. You know, they had basic heart-wrenching questions: ""Will I be able to recover the body of my son or daughter, my husband, my cousin, my mom and dad? How can I have closure without being able to bury them if I don't get the body? What do I do?""
Jill and I wanted them to know that we're with them and the country is with them. Our message today is that we're here for you, as one Nation—as one Nation. And that's the message we communicated. We'll be in touch with a lot of these families continuing through this process. But there is much more to be done. We're ready to do it.
And again, I thank the Governor, I thank my colleagues, my—Senator Scott and Senator Rubio, I thank Debbie Wasserman Schultz for their total, complete cooperation. There's no—there's no disagreement, no bickering. Everybody is on the same team. It's what America is all about. It's about pulling together, leaving nobody behind. And that's what made me feel—the one thing that made me feel good about this is the—is a cohesion that exists. There's no Democrat or Republican out there; they're just people wanting to do the right thing for their fellow Americans.
So may God bless the victims and their families, and may God protect our first responders.
And I'll take a couple questions right now.
Search-and-Rescue Efforts at the Champlain Towers South Condominium Building in Surfside, Florida 
Q. Mr. President, what were you told today about the likelihood—you said, ""Hope springs eternal""—but that somebody will be able to be pulled out alive from this? And what were you able to convey to the families about that possibility?
The President. Well, look, first of all, the families are very realistic. They know the longer it goes—and one of the things that the local FEMA personnel as well as the local first responders did is, they took all of the families to the site to see: to see what it looked like up close. And they're all realists. They all look, and they see those floors just literally feet—cement upon cement upon cement.
You know, I—when I talked to some of the families, some of the people who did escape, survived, got out, they talked about watching the building collapse and watching as they were in the garage—one floor come down—literally a whole floor on top of another floor. They know that the chances are, as each day goes by, diminished slightly.
But at a minimum—at a minimum—they want to recover the bodies. They want to recover the bodies. There's a lot of very religious people who are in there. Members of the—the rabbis in the Jewish community were talking about the need to make sure that they recover the body and be able to bury them. Give them—and you know, the—anyway.
So I think they're very realistic, Mike [Mike Memoli, NBC News]. But I don't think that that, in any way, suggests that it's too—that we should stop. I think that we should move on, continue to try to recover the bodies.
In the meantime, that's why NIST and others are determining whether or not it's safe to send the first responders back. When they'd asked me about this, I'd point out that the last thing they would want and we would want is, in the process of trying to recover—and the possibility—there's still a possibility someone could be alive, someone could still be breathing, someone could be there—that the last thing you want to have happen is have that building collapse and kill 10, 20, 30, 50 firefighters or wound them, or first responders.
So—but Mike, they're—you know, they're realistic. I—it just brought back so many—so many memories. It's bad enough—it's bad enough—to lose somebody. But the hard part—the really hard part—is to not know whether they're surviving or not, just not have any idea.
When the accident took my wife and my family, the hardest part was: Were my boys going to get out? Are they going to make it? And not knowing. Not knowing, when you're flying home from Washington to get the news. You know, you just don't know. So it's—but I was amazed—as you know, unfortunately, I've done a lot of these circumstances where I've met with families who have had great loss. And what amazed me about this group of people was the resilience and their absolute commitment, their willingness to do whatever it took to find—to find an answer. I walked away impressed by their strength.
And—and Nancy [Nancy Cook], Bloomberg, do you have a question?
Q. Yes——
The President. I was told.
Collapse of the Champlain Towers South Condominium Building in Surfside, Florida/Climate Change and Rising Sea Levels 
Q. Oh, thank you. Yes. What did you learn, if anything, about the collapse of the building? Is there anything more you learned from investigators or the FEMA Administrators today?
The President. No, it's underway. I don't—and the Director of FEMA is with me here. We don't have any firm proof of what's happened. There's all kinds of rational speculation about whether or not the rebars are—were rusted; whether or not the cement—whether it was limestone or not; whether or not—but a lot of the families who survived talked about how upset they were that, in the last years that they've been here, how there was one condominium complex built across the street, and a road was purchased. And while they were living there, they would hear the drilling, and they'd feel their building moving and shaking.
There are all kinds of discussions about whether or not they thought that water level rising—what impact it had. And interesting to me—I didn't raise it—but how many of the survivors and how many of the families talked about the impact of global warming. How much—and they didn't know exactly, but they talked about sea levels rising and about how there were—and—and the combination of that and the concern about incoming storms—incoming tropical storms.
And so—but I don't think there is, at this point, any definitive judgment as to why it collapsed and what can be done to prevent it from happening and what other buildings may have to be inspected to determine if they have the same problems.
I'm supposed to head out and catch up with the Governor. So I want to thank you all for taking the time.
Manhattan District Attorney's Investigation of the Trump Organization/Supreme Court Decision Upholding Arizona State Voting Restrictions/Voting Rights Protections 
Q. Mr. President, can we ask you about two matters away from where we are now? The first is: While you've been speaking, a top associate of the former President has been in a New York court, pleading not guilty to various financial charges. Do you have a reaction to that?
And secondarily, if I can, does the Supreme Court's ruling today on an important voting rights decision add to the sense of urgency you feel about pursuing voting rights legislation at this time?
The President. I know nothing about the first circumstance because I've been gone. I don't have any idea, so I'm not going to comment on that. And even if I did, I wouldn't comment on an ongoing case if it's an ongoing case.
With regard to the second point: I think I did get a summary on the way down on the plane of the Supreme Court decision. It is mildly positive, in the sense that there's a remedy available based on the particular voting decision.
I think that it is critical that we make a distinction between voter suppression and suspension. The ability of a State legislative body to come along and vote—their legislature—vote to change who is declared the winner, I find to be somewhat astounding.
But the Supreme Court rule did not rule that way today, to the best of my knowledge. And—but I'll have much more to say about that, because I plan on speaking extensively on voting rights and—as well as going on the road on this issue.
So thank you all very much.","NOTE: The President spoke at 4:29 p.m. at the St. Regis Bal Harbour Resort. In his remarks, he referred to Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne B. Criswell; Mayor Daniella Levine Cava of Miami-Dade County, FL; and Edward Kelly, president, International Association of Firefighters.","Joseph R.

1-Jul-21,"Remarks Prior to a Briefing on the Surfside Residential Building Collapse in Miami Beach, Florida","[The President's remarks were joined in progress.] 
The President. ——and I've got to say that, you know, having been to, unfortunately, a lot of—like many of us have—a lot of disaster sites because of natural disasters, it's—what you're doing, in coordination among you all, has been just admirable. It really is impressive.
And so I just want to say thanks and listen and find out what I can do as President and what I can unleash, in terms of help, for whatever you need.
The Governor and the mayor have been completely open with me, asked whatever they—whatever they've asked, I think we've been able to deliver. And I think there's more that we can do, including—I think I have the power—and we'll know shortly that—to be able to pick up a hundred percent of the cost for the county and the State for 30 days.
Mayor Daniella Levine Cava of Miami-Dade, Florida. Oh, my goodness, Mr. President.
The President. I think I'm quite sure I can do that. And so we're going to do that.
And there's going to be a lot—you all know it because a lot of you have been through it as well—there's going to be a lot of pain and anxiety and suffering and even need for psychological help in the days and months that follow.
And so we're not going anywhere.
Mayor Levine Cava. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. No, for real. But, again, I just want to, you know, start the day, if I could, but getting as thorough briefing as you're able to give me, and tell me what you need. And that goes for both the Senators and the Congresswoman and anyone in Florida, just to pick up the phone to the Oval. For real. I'm not joking about it.
And I think the Gov will tell you—anything you ask for, we got. And we have another group of teams coming from FEMA today. How many people will it be?
Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Bennett Criswell. At the end of the day, there should about 500 on the ground.
The President. Five hundred on the ground.
So, again, this is your show. We just want to make sure that whatever you need—and you know, including—well, anyway, I'm talking too much. Why don't I—I want to hear from you guys.
Mayor Levine Cava. All right. Well, Mr. President, we cannot thank you enough for being here with us, for showing your extraordinary support from day one. You called me that morning. We hustled into a little room in the Family Reunification Center so I could take the call, and you said whatever we need. And I said, ""Bring FEMA,"" and here they are, on the ground.
[At this point, Mayor Levine Cava continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
So I—we have a briefing for you. And I want to start with our Governor. And I want to thank you, Governor DeSantis. Your team has been amazing, but you personally have been amazing. You've been a steady, calming, reassuring, but forceful voice every step of the way. And it's been a pleasure to partner with you, truly. Thank you. Thank you.
Governor Ronald D. DeSantis of Florida. Well, if I could——
The President. Let me say just one more thing. You know what's good about this—the way you've cooperated? We're letting the Nation know we can cooperate.
Mayor Levine Cava. Yes, sir. That's right.
The President. And when it's really important——
Mayor Levine Cava. That's right.
The President. ——when it's really important—I was talking to Debbie about it on the way down—we come together. This is life and death.
And so I don't think—I just got back from about 12 days in Europe. They wonder whether we can do this. And you're doing it. I mean, just the simple act of everybody doing whatever needs to be done is a—and it really makes a difference, Gov.
Gov. DeSantis. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And you've recognized the severity of this tragedy from day one. And you've been very supportive.
We, in Florida—you know, you'll drive up and down these coastal roads, you'll see these buildings. And I've driven by that building, probably never thought twice. And then, something like this happens, and you recognize in each individual unit there's an amazing story.
And lives have been shattered irrevocably as a result of this. We've already identified, unfortunately, fatalities—people who've been 92 years old, have been a matriarch of a wonderful family. We have families with kids missing. And we even have young newlyweds who hadn't even been married a year who were in the tower when it collapsed.
And so the cooperation has been great. The local—both the municipal and the county have been fantastic. And you guys have not only been supportive at the Federal level, but we've had no bureaucracy. When we're dealing with FEMA, we're literally getting requests routed from local to State to Federal in no time——
The President. I promise you, there will be none.
Gov. DeSantis. ——and the approval is happening. Yes.
[Gov. DeSantis continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
But I can tell you this: We're not going to stop until we identify everybody and until we do what we need to do. So thank you, Mr. President.
Mayor Levine Cava. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to acknowledge the leadership of the First Lady, Casey DeSantis, as well, who is very, very focused on children and mental health issues and is bringing that agenda to our discussions. And of course, we've been including all of that, as you'll learn from the briefings. But we know how important First Ladies are—[laughter]—so we just wanted to be sure to give a shout out.

30-Jun-21,"Remarks on Signing Legislation Regarding Methane Pollution, Predatory Lending, and Employment Discrimination","The President. Thank you. Madam Speaker, welcome to almost the other side. [Laughter] It's great to see you guys. And it's strange to have Congressmen stand up for me; that's an unusual thing to do. [Laughter] But thank you so much.
Well, welcome to the adjunct to the White House here. The—I'm about to sign into law three bills which you all have written and passed protecting our planet from climate-disturbing greenhouse gas, particularly methane, which is devastating; protecting consumers from predatory lenders; and protecting workers from employment discrimination. Each of these bills—each of these bills—reflects a return to common sense and commitment to the common good, and I want to thank every one of you for your leadership in getting this done.
The first bill is going to help us to drastically cut methane pollution. You may remember—and I know you all do, but to say this for the press and those listening, back when President Obama, in 2016, and I put in place a rule that required that companies capture methane leaks from the wells they were digging.
Well, guess what? They didn't. And so, since then, we've learned that methane is even more dangerous to the climate than we knew back then, in 2016—trapping much more heat—up to 80 times more heat, methane does—and carbon—than carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere.
And look, this is an important first step of cutting methane pollution. Our bipartisan infrastructure plan will include $21 billion in environmental remediation to capping millions of abandoned wells, leaking wells, and oil and gas wells. And so it will be a good step forward.
The second bill will protect borrowers against predatory lenders. In many States, these lenders are kept in check by caps on how much interest they can charge, but some loan sharks and online lenders have figured out how to get around these limits and—by using a partnership with a bank to avoid the State cap and charging outrageous interest. And I'm—you all have pointed out—some as high as 100-percent interest, which is astounding. And I must admit to you, I didn't know that. I was unaware they could do—pull that off.
These are so called ""rent-a-bank"" schemes. And they allow lenders to prey on veterans, seniors, and other unsuspecting borrowers tapping into—trapping them into a cycle of debt. And the last administration let it happened, but we won't.
And the third bill is going to help us hold employers accountable for workplace discrimination. As a nation, we continue to strive toward realizing our founding principle that all people are created equal and have a right to full access to the American Dream, and that includes at work—at work. That's why we have the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces the law that makes job discrimination illegal.
The last administration put in place a rule that makes it harder—makes it harder—for those seeking redress for job discrimination to get justice. With this law, we're going to move in the direction of greater accountability, fairness, and justice.
[At this point, the President invited Members of Congress up to the signing desk and signed the bills.]","NOTE: The President spoke at 5:37 p.m. in the South Court Auditorium of the Dwight D.

30-Jun-21,Remarks During a Meeting With Western Governors on Wildfire Prevention and Response Efforts,"[The President's remarked were joined in progress.] 
The President. ——proud of our Cabinet. And they're all here today. They all want to be engaged. They all want to help. And so, hopefully, we're going to get into some exchanges going down the line here.
I want to thank you all again for being in the support meetings. So thank you, thank you, thank you. And, Governor Newsom, you trying to make us feel bad, listening in that magnificent background you have over there—[laughter]—and while I'm sitting in here in the White House? God love you. Anyway, it's good to see you all, really. Thank you.
For years, the President has received a briefing at the beginning of the hurricane season, looking at the trends that are coming to get a sense of what's coming so that the country can be better prepared.
And when I received that briefing this year, I asked for a second briefing that does the same thing, but now we're doing it about wildfire season. And we know this is becoming a regular cycle, and we know it's getting worse. In fact, the threat of western wildfires this year is as severe as it's ever been.
And I wanted to convene this group of Governors—of western State Governors, key members of my Cabinet, FEMA leadership, and the leadership from utility industries, and senior members of our White House team to make sure we're doing everything—and I mean this sincerely—we're doing everything possible to help you prepare for what's coming, and some is already there.
The truth is, we're playing catch up. This is an area that has been underresourced, but that's going to change, if we have anything to do with it. We can't cut corners when it comes to managing our wildfires or supporting our firefighters. And this briefing is going to be an annual event to make sure we're focusing on preventing fires—the fire threats in the first place—as well as responding when they arise.
But right now, we have to act and act fast. We're late in the game here. We're remembering the horrific scenes from last year: orange skies that looked like end of days; smoke and ash that made the air dangerous to breathe; more than 10 million acres burned; billions of dollars in economic damage; families that lost their homes and everything they own; and too many—too many—lost lives.
And this year, we—they could be even tougher, based on the weather patterns. You know, California and some other places, the drought conditions are twice that's—what they were last year. And right now, we're seeing record heat in Portland and across the West.
And this [last]* year, you know, 21 large, uncontained fires were burning. This year, there are 36 that are uncontained and burning. There are already about 9,000 firefighters deployed across the region—from California to New Mexico, to Utah and Nevada—and it's only June. I know—I realize I'm preaching to the choir here. I know you all know this better than any other people in the country.
Fire season, traditionally, lasts through October. But with climate change—climate change driving the dangerous confluence of extreme heat and prolonged drought—we're seeing wildfires in greater intensity that move with more speed, last—you know, and lasts well beyond traditional months—the traditional months of the fire season. And that's a problem for all of us.
Wildfires are not a partisan phenomenon. They don't stop at a county or a State line—or country line, for that matter. We need a coordinated, comprehensive response with all the Federal working—all the Federal Government working in close cooperation to support you, the States. That's what this is about. We want to know what you—the States and localities and Tribal governments and those in the frontlines—are facing in this danger and what you think would help the most.
Today we're taking critical steps to help protect American communities right away. First, we're going to make sure that we have enough firefighters on call who are trained, equipped, and ready to respond for all this fire season. And we're going to pay them. They—I mean, the idea these folks are running into—anyway, we should pay them.
Last week, I learned that some of our Federal firefighters are being paid less than $13 an hour. Come on, man. This is—that's unacceptable to me. And I immediately directed my team to take decisive action to fix it.
So today we're announcing what I still think is not enough: This year we're going to provide retention incentives that's going to ensure Federal wildland fires are—firefighters are making at least $15 an hour and provide for additional 10-percent bonuses for those working on the frontlines.
But a one-time boost is not enough. These courageous women and men take an incredible risk of running toward the fire, and they deserve to be paid and paid good wages. You know that old expression: ""God made man. Then, he made a few firefighters""? Well, it's true. They're incredible. I've spent a lot of time, my whole career, with them.
So we're going to work with Congress, and I know many of your Senators and Representatives have been working hard on this for—to permanently get Federal firefighters a better deal, including improvements in their compensation, their benefits, and their work-life balance.
The Federal Government is also offering funding, when Governors request it, to train and equip National Guard members so they have a—they're ready to provide a surge of firefighting capacity.
You know, one of the things I learned over the years, being so deeply involved with the firefighters, is the only thing that saves a firefighter's life is another firefighter. That's the single most consequential thing.
And you know, one of the hardest speeches I've ever had to make—and you've all—we've all made difficult speeches—was at the funeral of the 19 Granite Mountain Hotshot firefighters, when the Prescott, Arizona, Fire Department got clobbered. That tragedy happened 8 years ago today. That's the reason I mention it. It's hard to remember—of all the costs that firefighters risk when they do their job and their bravery to step up and do the job.
Now, traditionally, Federal firefighting has been a seasonal job, but because of climate change—and I know you all know it, and I hope your constituents know it: There is climate change—it's no longer a seasonal job. This is a year-round mission.
So we've made sure seasonal firefighters can stay on the job, as long as they are needed this year, by allowing them to work beyond their term. And for next year, we're working to make more than—of those positions, permanent positions so that when fires aren't burning, we have a workforce of experienced hands enhancing our forest management, reducing the risk of future fire in the future fire season.
Second thing: We are harnessing new tools and technologies to better identify and respond before new fires grow into large, uncontrolled conflagrations. So, for example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, has satellite technology that is able to see from space when new fires start, while they're still small, even as small as the size of your dining room table.
Similarly, the Department of Energy has a sensor array computer analysis capability that can detect in real time the lightning strikes that might set off a blaze. And we're going to use those tools to identify fires that start in remote places and share that information so the firefighters on the ground can respond immediately before a fire has spread out of control. I know that's not a full answer, but it's real. It will improve things.
And we're also going to make sure that the people have a—the information to better protect themselves and their families from smoke and fire risks. This will include launching a new app on—from EPA, so individuals can easily access the latest information on air quality, smoke plumes, and public health guidance.
Third, we also have to make investments in our future. That's why the bipartisan infrastructure framework investment of about $50 billion in the—my so-called—anyway, I won't go into it. But a bill that's caused a little attention—infrastructure bill—is going to build resilience to extreme weather events like wildfires—$50 billion.
And today I'm announcing a $37 million Federal grant to Sonoma County, California, in support of fire mitigation efforts that are underway. This grant is part of FEMA's BRIC program, Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities. My administration doubled BRIC funding to support local efforts to strengthen resilience. And because Sonoma knows all too well the devastation wrought by fires, they were the first to apply for fire mitigation funding. I encourage more communities to do so next year.
And finally, I want to note that the extreme heat we're seeing in the West is not only a risk amplifier for wildfires, it's a threat in and of itself. People are hurting. It's more dangerous for kids to play outside. Roads are buckling under the heat. I need not—again, I need not tell all of you.
We need people to check on their neighbors, especially seniors who may need a helping hand; outdoor laborers, like our farm and construction workers, are going to need frequent water breaks and shade. I want to thank the Governors and local leaders for providing information to citizens and the resources like cooling centers where people can go to get relief from the heat.
And to our utility leaders: We are ready to work with you to make sure that people have the access to power, including air conditioning, under these extreme demand conditions while continuing to advance our climate goals.
Now, I'm eager to hear from each of you—each of the Governors—as to what the experience has been in your State and what we can do better to be helpful. Because this is an area where investing in prevention and preparation today is going to deliver invaluable returns tomorrow. And the Federal Government is going to have to do—have your backs. And that's going to—that's my intention.
I'll close by just saying thank you to everyone from the Forest Service, to the Department of Interior and Agriculture, to FEMA, to State and local and Tribal partners, and most importantly, our firefighters for all your incredible work. We've asked so much of the firefighters already, and I know you're going to continue to step up.
Now I'm going to ask Vice President Harris to say a few words, and then we'll move on. Madam Vice President, the floor is yours.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Thank you, Mr. President. First, I just want to thank the President for prioritizing this for his administration.
[At this point, the Vice President continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
And the bottom line is that: As the President has said, his bipartisan framework for infrastructure is going to address a lot of these challenges. But there is other work to be done, and so I look forward to staying in touch with all of you. And again, thank you for your leadership.
The President. Well, thank you.
Governor Brown, if you'd be willing, you could give us an overview of what you—the challenges are you western Governors are facing and what you think we should be doing and can do to help. I—the floor is yours.
Governor Kate Brown of Oregon. Thank you so much, Mr. President and Madam Vice President, for having us here for this incredibly important conversation.
[Gov. Brown continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
And then, finally—and I just have to say, gratefully—our Good Neighbor Authority—we have partnered with the Federal Government over the years to reduce wildfire risk on Federal lands through collaborative processes, including prescribed burns, removing dead trees and underbrush. With the recent passage of our State legislation, we have an opportunity to fund even more of these Good Neighbor Authority projects together. It's a win, win, win. It creates jobs, creates healthy landscapes, and reduces wildfire risk. And we have the dollars to invest now.
So we look forward to partnering for you—with you, and we are incredibly grateful, Mr. President, for your leadership.
Back over to you.
The President. Well, Madam Governor, I'm not being solicitous when I say we're grateful for your leadership. I really mean it.
And one of the things that I'd like to ask before we move on is: What would you be looking for us to do at the Federal level to strengthen this agreement to build off the lessons that—you know, the Good Neighbor agreement? And is there anything in particular that is—you've learned from last season that would be—add to the needs of this season?
Gov. Brown. Well, you mentioned it in your remarks, Mr. President: Making sure we have resources to train our National Guards men and women prior to fire season has been extremely helpful the last two fire seasons. This should be universal practice nationwide. It's incredibly helpful. We have relied on our National Guard every step of the way throughout the pandemic, and we certainly rely on them in support activities and firefighting.
The other piece—and I see Chief Christiansen there—in terms of the Good Neighbor Authority, this has been extraordinary in our ability to put people back to work in our timber-dependent rural communities, in our ability to create healthy landscapes, in our ability to provide timber for the mills, and frankly, our ability to reduce wildfire risk.
And so more resources to collaborate and provide what you describe as ""comprehensive, collective efforts"" to reduce wildfire risk would be extremely helpful.
The President. Well, we ought to get—not in this moment—but we're ought to get, no pun intended, deeply in the weeds as to specifically what can be done.
And I'd ask my appropriate Cabinet members to be working with your people as to what we can do along those lines because it seems to be self-evident that that makes a lot of sense.
And—but we have a lot of other things to cover here, but I look to Dr. Sherwood: Are we moving to——
Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall. We're going to move shortly. If you want to ask any further questions of Governors, and we can move, with the press departing, and we'll continue our discussion.
The President. Let me ask the Vice President if she has any questions and/or any Cabinet member if they have any questions for the Governor.
Vice President Harris. What I'm interested—it's really a follow-up to what the President asked: What—with each consecutive wildfire season—and they are growing in terms of the enormity—what are we learning? And how can the Federal Government address the challenges and the gaps that you have seen with each fire season, in terms of the resources, but also the approach?
And—for example, including the public education piece; including the piece that is about encouraging the private sector, where appropriate, to be engaged around resilience and adaptation. On the issue of water policy, what kind of resources do you need that are also preventative as well as reactive to the wildfires themselves?
Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Adviser Sherwood-Randall. Governor Newsom, do you want to pick that one up?
Governor Gavin C. Newsom of California. Yes. Well, first, if I could just make a little indulgence—and thank you, Madam Governor and Madam Vice President—Mr. President, I've been waiting almost, well, 4½ years to hear a President say what you just said.
[Gov. Newsom continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And I just want to say we respect and appreciate your leadership, and we're just grateful and humbled that you took the time today to be with all of us.
The President. Well, look, Gov, this is a—I'm not doing anybody any favor. I just think if—if I were sitting in your seat or Governor Brown's seat, what I'd be—I mean, this is urgent.
And one of the things that I have found since becoming President is how often I'm required to call in the National Guard.
Vice President Harris. Yes.
The President. The National Guard. I spent yesterday—well, that's not true—2 days ago—meeting with our military. What they've done is just astounding. I just met with the general who had coordinated probably the largest effort to—the largest logistical effort in American history getting all these COVID vaccines out.
I mean, think about what—how we're relying on the military in ways we never, ever, ever anticipated. And now I got my briefing at NOAA on what was going on in hurricane season. And it's, you know—and we're looking for the National Guard there too.
And so we just have to think differently, like you all have been talking about. And I promise you, when we get down to the nitty gritty—and a lot of this we're already getting down there—you got to tell us what you need. And we can debate it. We can discuss it.
And I think this is a—you know, that old overused expression—a ""wake-up call"" to the rest of the public, who all of a sudden is saying—I've had people say to me, when I've been on the road the last month—less than that; probably the last 3 weeks—""Oh, my God. I didn't think things were really changing that much. I saw those—those photographs of the reservoirs in California, and—oh, my God—they're really—there's no water?"" Or people saying, ""A hundred and seventeen degrees and—you know, in Portland?""
So I think this is both—you know, the old expression—we've got to make lemonade out of lemons here. We have a chance to do something that not only deals with the problem today, but allows us to be in a position to move forward to make and create real good jobs, by the way, generate economic growth in all the process.
So thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 11:11 a.m. in the South Court Auditorium of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building. In his remarks, he referred to Gov.

29-Jun-21,"Remarks on Jobs and Infrastructure Legislation in La Crosse, Wisconsin","Good afternoon. Thank you, Laurie. Please, please, please sit down. I once said that to a big crowd; it was in the evening. I said, ""Please, sit down."" And there were no seats. They were out in a football field. [Laughter] And the press pointed out, ""Biden is losing it."" [Laughter] But I can see you all have seats. [Laughter]
Laurie, thank you very much. I told Laurie, when she was showing me the bus she's driving now: Back when I was in law school, I drove a school bus during the summers to pick up spending money. And from one bus driver to another, Laurie—[laughter]—I want to thank you for all you do to make this city run, to help folks get where they need to go. And you do it in a way that sometimes is not always easy.
I'm glad to be here with great Wisconsin leaders. Gov, I guess I landed at the airport just a few minutes before you did. Thank you for making the effort to be here. And my good friend, Tammy Baldwin—Senator Baldwin is here. And Congressman Ron Kind is—and, Mom, thank you for raising a good kid.
And Mayor Reynolds. I was telling the mayor—he just won reelection—he won election. And I said, ""You know, I always wonder why everybody runs for mayor,"" because they—it's the hardest job in American politics. They know where you live. [Laughter] You can't go to the grocery store. ""Why is that pothole still there?"" I get it. You don't even control that. But anyway, Mr. Mayor, thank you for your service. Thank you for willing to serve.
I'm here in Wisconsin to celebrate a step forward for my country—our country—to talk a little bit about what it's going to mean for working families here in Wisconsin and across the Nation. When I was sworn in 5 months ago, I pledged to put my whole soul into bringing America together. I said I was running for three reasons, the last one of which I said is to unite America.
I admit it's difficult, and I think some of my friends in the press thought it was impossible. I still don't think it is, but—because I believe that there's nothing we cannot do if we bring—come together as a nation, Democrats and Republicans. And we're really divided on a whole range of things.
But if you look back across our history, from the transcontinental railroad to the creation of the internet, you can see the truth in that idea, about coming together. Because America—America—has always been propelled into the future by landmark national investments—investments that only the Government has the capacity to make; only the Government, working together, could make.
Today happens to mark—coincidental—but today is the 60th [65th]* anniversary of one of those significant investments to change the Nation. Sixty-five years ago today, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the bill that created the Interstate Highway System. Sixty-five years ago today. That was the last infrastructure investment of the size and scope of what—the agreement I'm about to talk about today.
It's time for us to write a new chapter in that story. After months of careful negotiation, of listening, of compromising together in a good faith, moving together, with ups and downs and some blips, a bipartisan group of Senators got together and they forged an agreement to move forward on the key priorities of my American Jobs Plan, and one of them is sitting in front of me.
As a result, this is a generational investment—a generational investment—to modernize our infrastructure, creating millions of good-paying jobs—and that's not coming from me, that's coming from Wall Street—millions of good-paying jobs that position America to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st century, because China is way out-working us, in terms of infrastructure.
And it's going to make the world of difference for families here in Wisconsin. Here's what it's going to do: This deal will put American workers to work in good-paying jobs, not minimum wage jobs, not 15-dollar-an-hour jobs. Prevailing wage jobs, good-paying jobs, repairing our roads and our bridges.
You all know why that matters. One in 5 miles of highway and roads in America are in poor condition—1 in 5 miles. Some States it's worse where the weather is tougher. Five percent—50 years—50 [40]* percent of our bridges are over 50 years old. More than 1,000 bridges here in Wisconsin are rated as structurally deficient by engineers—1,000 just in Wisconsin.
And I'm not—that doesn't make Wisconsin better or worse; it's—all across the Nation, it's this way. The bridges—the 10 most traveled bridges in America need repair, and some need to be completely rebuilt. More than 600—more than 600 here in the State of Wisconsin—bridges have weight limits to prevent trucks from crossing. That means long detours for farmers heading to market.
It's more than just an inconvenience; it's about safety as well. In November 2019, a school bus in Arcadia, Wisconsin, tipped over going around a curve and went into a ditch with 20 students on board. It wasn't because of snow or ice; it was just an old country road. It was rough conditions. Thank God nobody was seriously injured at the time.
But this is a drain on our economy as well. Typical American—typical American—and it varies slightly from State to State—but the typical American pays a hidden tax of more than $1,000 a year in wasted time—wasted time—and fuel due to traffic congestion. Now, in the more the rural the areas, the less the congestion. But that creates other difficulties. You all know that feeling: losing time, sitting in traffic, or being rerouted because the bridge isn't wide enough or the road is poorly maintained.
This deal is going to put Americans back to fixing all of that and good-paying jobs. This deal will also put Americans to work replacing 100 percent of our Nation's lead water pipes. You know, there's 400,000—well, I won't get into the numbers; I get a little carried away—but it's really dangerous. Every single American child, at home or in school, will soon be able to turn on that faucet, and their moms and dads know that the water they're drinking is clean and safe.
I'll give you an example of why that matters. Just look at the city of Milwaukee. Milwaukee has more than 160,000 water service lines. More than 70,000 of them, nearly half, have lead service lines. And by the way, I'm not—it's not picking on Wisconsin, Gov. Every State is like this. But just to know what you're going to be doing for the State of Wisconsin here.
You know, we know that exposure to lead in drinking water can trigger a number of serious problems. Even low levels of lead can cause behavioral and learning problems in children, impairing their growth. There are up to 10 million homes with lead pipe service lines and pipes. Children in up to 400,000 schools—400,000 schools—and childcare facilities are at risk of exposure to lead. This deal contains the largest investment in clean drinking water and waste water infrastructure in American history.
This deal also provides something you're very familiar with in the Island. It provides funding to get dangerous chemicals out of our water systems, known as PFAs, or ""forever chemicals."" This is a problem all across the country, and I know that you're feeling it right here—right here.
Here in La Crosse County, just this spring, the State had to provide free bottled water to thousands of people on French Island because they were worried about those chemicals in the groundwater, which were linked to cancer and other illnesses. We'll pay for that. We'll get that done. We're also going to surge Federal resources to help address the forever chemicals not just here, but all across America. Unfortunately, Wisconsin is not unique in this problem.
This deal will also put Americans to work building transmission lines, the largest investment in clean energy transmission in American history. Power outages cost the U.S. economy up to—now, this is—now, we know this, but until you add it up, it doesn't seem to be that big a deal. It costs the economy, Congressman, $70 billion annually. You hear me? Nationally, $70 billion annually.
And as climate change induces extreme weather events more and more frequently, we need to make investments to build a more resilient grid to carry this electricity.
The majority of the Nation's grid is aging. Some components are over a century old. And 70 percent of transmission and distribution lines are well into the second half of their lifespans. You saw what happened in Texas this winter: The entire system in the State collapsed. The entire system.
That's why we have to act. This deal will modernize the power grid to be more energy efficient and resilient to—and resistant to extreme weather; resilient against bad actors who try to hack and attack the grid. Because I just spent a lot of time in Europe trying to work on that.
And it's going to strengthen and revitalize our natural infrastructure, like our coastlines and levees, while preparing our physical infrastructure for wildfires, floods, and other extreme weather.
Anybody ever believe you'd—you hear—turn on the news, and it will say it was 116 degrees in Portland, Oregon. A hundred and sixteen degrees. ""But don't worry, there is no global warming. It doesn't exist. It's a figment of our imagination."" Seriously.
When a severe storm rolls in, like you had in some parts of the State just recently, the power is going to be less likely to go out, the town water systems will be able to withstand what happens if we—once we make these investments.
And all—as all of you know, America has one of the highest road fatality rates of anywhere in the industrial world. Let me say that again: the highest road fatality rates of any industrial nation in the world. I lost a wife and daughter and almost lost two sons.
Look, our fatality rate is double the rate in Canada on a per capita basis. I bet every one of you here can tell me what the most dangerous intersections in your town are. I'll lay eight to five, no matter what the town is. Maybe you don't have many, but everybody knows what intersections are the most dangerous.
When you're teaching your kid to drive, what do you do? You tell them, ""No, don't go down that road when you come home."" I'm being deadly earnest. ""When you come home, come home the other way."" Well, guess what? We've got an agreement to invest $11 billion to help cities and localities reduce crashes and fatalities in the community, especially for cyclists and pedestrians, which are increasing significantly.
This deal is going to more than double the funding directed to State and local programs that improve the safety of people in vehicles, including highway safety, truck safety, pipeline and hazardous materials safety.
I won't even get into this now, but you know, we have thousands of miles of pipeline. The vast majority of those pipes are 60 years or older, some of them more than 80 years old. A lot of them are leaking.
This is the United States of America, for God's sake. What are we not doing?
This deal will also help high-speed internet and make sure it's available to every American home, including 35 percent of rural families who currently go without it.
As of last spring, more than 82,000 children here in Wisconsin, which prides itself on its education, didn't have reliable internet access at home. Think about that year—in a year of remote schooling. When so many of our needs and our connections were forced to move online, tens of thousands of Wisconsin kids got left behind.
Did you ever think, here in America, that kids would have to sit in a fast-food parking lot just to do their schoolwork and homework because they could connect online? Not a joke. Ask any mom who has kids in school or a dad who is taking care of them. No child should have to do that. And no farmer here in Wisconsin should lose business because they don't have a reliable connection to the internet: know when to buy, know when to sell, and know what's going on.
You know, back in 1936, the Federal Government brought electricity to nearly every home and farm in America, and it spread the opportunity out for cities in every part of the country. It changed the lives and fortunes of thousands and thousands of homeowners, thousands of hometowns, and millions of American families. And it set the stage for a massive, sustained economic boom that would follow World War II.
High-speed internet is the equivalent of that today. It's a similar—it's an equivalent of that. It isn't a luxury; it's now a necessity, like water and electricity. And this deal would provide for it for everyone, while bringing down the cost of internet service across the board.
This deal has also put Americans to work through a first-ever national effort to install electric vehicle charging stations, 500,000 charging stations nationwide along our highways and in rural and disadvantaged communities as well.
Think about what that can mean to the American autoworker and the future of electric vehicles. China is going full bore. They're providing more electric vehicles than any nation in the world. You know, it used to be, when I first got to the United States Senate, actually a couple of—actually, in the sixties, when I was getting out—the late sixties, when I was getting out of law school, what happened? We invested more in R&D and investment and manufacturing than any nation in the world. Now we're number eight in the world. China used to be number nine; now they're number two in the world.
And when you build a charging station, it spurs even more investment and more infrastructure around it: the local convenience store, the local hamburgers place. You know, think about—nobody is old enough, but my dad used to tell me—because he worked, back in the days, for the American Oil Company—they came along with automobile—the combustion engine. You needed to be able to put gas in the engine, I mean, in the car, the tank. Well, guess what? You had to build gas stations.
One of my dad's jobs and my Grandpop Biden's jobs was to go from city to city convincing them it was okay to bury these great big tanks with gasoline in them. And entire communities grew up around it.
Well, this is exactly what we have to do with regard to electric vehicles. This deal is also going to help our cities, our towns, our school districts deploy electric buses. Thirty-five thousand electric school buses that are accounted for. And there are about 475,000 school buses in this country, 95 percent of them like the ones you had here——
[At this point, a child fell off a chair.]
——is he okay, honey? You sure? He took a little bit of a tumble.
Ninety-five percent of them run on diesel. So, every day, more than 25 million kids and thousands of bus drivers breathe polluted air on the way to and from school. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other health problems. It hurts communities. It causes students to get sick and miss time in school. We owe it to our kids to clean up the school buses, and this deal will help do just that.
I know that the city of La Crosse is getting two electric transit buses this fall; I think I saw them both. I was down in the Carolinas, looking at the bus company where you're going to buy them—charging stations to power them.
This bipartisan deal—by the way, you had half Republicans and half Democrats come along and present this deal and negotiate this deal. It's going to help advance that effort.
This deal also modernizes our outdated airports, ports, and waterways. That means fewer delays that drain away so much money from families and from businesses. There's no good reason why that zero—zero—of the top 25 airports in the world are in American. Zero. Not one in the United States of America.
This deal will put Americans to work through long-overdue national environmental cleanups. That means good-paying jobs, capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up and capped—methane leaks—protecting the health of our communities. Making the same money it took to dig that well. And there's thousands of them.
Not to mention, this deal represents the largest investment in American passenger rail and in freight rail since the creation of Amtrak.
Now, I know I'm ""Mr. Amtrak."" I've traveled over 2 million miles on Amtrak. I commuted every day. I get it. I know you think I'm nuts. But, after my wife and daughter were killed, I decided to commute back and forth to Delaware. It was a 257-mile roundtrip.
I'll tell you a real quick story. I shouldn't bore you with it. But you know, the Secret Service—they're the best in the world—doesn't like you taking Amtrak because it stops too many times—the train. They want me flying home in the small jets that were available as Vice President. And—but that cost a lot of money, so I would go home on Fridays, you know, because my mom was passing away. I'd go home on Amtrak. And they published—they keep fastidious record of the miles you travel in an Air Force aircraft as President and Vice President.
And toward the end of my term, a headline came out in all of the papers: ""Biden travels""—I think it was 1.3 or 1.7 million miles on Air Force planes. And so I'm getting on the train on that Friday, and these guys who all became my family—all—the conductors. And a guy named Angelo Negri came up, and he goes, ""Joey, baby!"" Grabs my cheek like that. [Laughter] And I thought they were going to shoot him. I really did. [Laughter]
I said, ""No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He's a friend."" He was like, ""What the hell."" And he said, ""Big deal, Joey. A million""—whatever it was—""three-hundred thousand miles. You know how many miles you've traveled on Amtrak, Joey?"" And I said, ""No, Ange. I don't."" And he said: ""At that retirement dinner, we calculated it. We estimated 127 days a year, 250 miles back and forth, three—36 years, then as Vice President. Joey, you traveled more on Amtrak."" [Laughter]
Well, I—and when they named a station after me in my city, someone complained that Biden is using his influence. I said, ""Hell, they should name the whole Northeast Corridor after me."" I've—[laughter]—more than anybody else.
But all kidding aside, studies show that if you can get to your destination in the same amount of time or less on rail than you can by car, people will take rail. And, Gov, you know this better than anybody. Imagine if you could get from Chicago—from La Crosse to Chicago in 2 hours, instead of 4½. That's what this will allow us to build the capacity to do.
And besides, it will not only make your travel easier, not—I don't know why you'd go to Chicago, but—you know, all kidding aside—it would reduce the largest source of pollution in America: vehicle travel.
We're not just tinkering around the edges here. We're going to invest $66 billion in rail to eliminate backlogs, bring world-class rail service to areas outside the Northeast. Here in Wisconsin, we'll add new stops in Green Bay, Madison, and Eau Claire.
This deal also makes the largest investment in public transit in American history. A whole lot of people here in Wisconsin depend on public transportations, like the bus system here in La Crosse, to get to work, to school, and get around. Because of this deal, it will be safer, quicker, cleaner, more frequent, and more available—more reliable. More transit options mean more people can access good jobs as well. One study found that it leads to higher wages for workers because businesses can attract more customers with the rail.
This bipartisan breakthrough is a great deal for the American people—not just for folks in the cities, not just for red States or blue States, but for everybody. And this job—this jobs—the jobs that are going to be created here, largely, it's going to be those for blue-collar workers, the majority of whom will not have to have a college degree to have those jobs.
A lot of those folks are being left behind now. The guys I grew up with in Scranton and Claymont are being left behind. This is the answer for good-paying jobs. Jobs is—jobs not just in our biggest cities, along our coasts, but in small towns across the country so families can build wealth and opportunity in rural hometowns and don't have to leave when they're grown up.
I've said it all along: This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America, and long before, families in Wisconsin are going to see the benefits firsthand. Look, I'm always quoting my dad because he was smart and I loved him. My dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community."" I mean he really would say this. When he lost everything in Scranton and we had to move down to Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town.
And he said—and the deal is going to deliver breathing room. All he said was, ""All you want, as a middle-class person, is just to have a little bit of breathing room. Not—just a little bit of breathing room."" That's why we've got to build this economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not trickle down, creating good-paying jobs with dignity and jobs that cannot be outsourced.
And critically, we're going to get it all done without raising taxes on a single American earning less than $400,000. Now, all of you making over $400,000, I love you, but I don't mind a little bit if your taxes go up a little bit.
But all kidding aside, I made a commitment: Nobody—I would not support anything that raised a penny in tax on someone making under 400 grand. And that means, in this bill, there is no gas tax. Working families have already paid enough.
Instead, we're going to pay for these investments, in part, by giving the Internal Revenue Service the resources it needs to collect taxes on the wealthiest Americans who owe, but are currently not paying under the existing tax rules. And by the way, it's not done by this—it will be done by conservative economists and liberal economists. It cracks down on tax cheats, not just hard-working, middle class Americans.
And there's a lot of important investments in this deal that are long overdue. Economists of all stripes agree that it's going to create good jobs and dramatically strengthen our economy in the long run. It makes it easier for businesses to seamlessly transport their goods, makes it easier for workers to more easily access job opportunities.
But the reason this agreement matters so much: It's about what it represents. This deal isn't just the sum of its parts; it's a signal to ourselves and to the world that American democracy can come through and deliver for all our people. We can be united.
I just met with the G-7. I just met with all of NATO. And I just met with Putin. The autocrats think that democracy can't keep up with autocrats. Not a joke. But it's living proof that we can still come together in this country and accomplish something big and transformational.
I know that neither Democrats nor Republicans get everything they want in this agreement. It's not all that I proposed. But that's what our economy is all about. That's what it means to compromise and reach consensus. And that's what every—in the heart of every democracy.
And we can't give up on what we—keep finding ways to come together. Because every time we negotiate in good faith and come together to get something big done, we break a little more of the ice that too often keeps us frozen in place and prevents us from solving the real problems people are facing.
Let me be clear: There's much more to do. And I'm going to continue to fight for more. I'm going to keep working with Congress to pass even more of my economic agenda so we can keep building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
As we bring home key parts of my American Jobs Plan, I'm going to make the case—and I've told this to the negotiators—I'm going to continue to make the case there are critical investments are still needed, including those in my Family Plan—American Family Plan.
Maybe the most important among them is extending the child tax credit, which will significantly benefit middle class and working folks. Let me explain what that is. Pretty soon, taxpayers in America are going to get a significant check back from the IRS. For example, if you are—if you have to pay taxes and you have a good income, you get to deduct $2,000 per dependent—per child. And that comes off the bottom line of your taxes, and you probably still owe more after that's cut off.
But for families who, in fact, don't have that big a tax bill, they don't get anything from this. So we changed the law this year, and it's cutting child poverty by 40 percent. And here in Wisconsin, by July 15, we're going to start—they're going to be picking up the phone and calling you to say, ""Thanks, Gov."" And they're going to get checks from the IRS.
Here's what they did: For every child you have under the age of 6, you're going to get $3,600. And for every child under the age of—between—over the age of 12, you're going to get $3,000. So you'll actually get a cash payment instead of just a credit against your taxes, because you don't pay that many taxes if you're—if you're making—if you're making the minimum wage or you're making $20-, $30-, $40,000 a year. And people say, ""Well, that's a giveaway."" Hey, guys, I think it's time to give ordinary people a tax break. [Laughter] The wealthy are doing fine. No, I mean it. I mean it.
Why is this not a tax break for working folks, when the stuff we give to the superwealthy are called ""tax breaks""? Look, major action on clean energy, housing, caregiving, on child and paid leave, universal pre-K, free community college. The human infrastructure is intertwined with our physical infrastructure. It's going to help us create more good jobs, ease the burden on working families, and strengthen our economy in the long run.
And I'm going out—I'm going to be out there making the case for the American people until this job is done; until we bring this bipartisan deal home; until our human infrastructure, also, needs are met; until we have a fair tax system to pay for all of this.
And by the way, what I'm talking about in the Family Plan, let me tell you how I'm going to pay for it. And the American people, in the polling data, overwhelmingly support it. If we just raise the corporate tax to 28 percent—it used to be 35 percent. It was supposed to come down to 28; it's now 21. If you raise it to 28 percent, you know how much money that raises? One-point-four trillion dollars. If you have a minimum global tax, which we agreed to in Europe—that means so corporations can't avoid paying the taxes at home—that would generate, in America, $385 billion. If you end deductions for foreign corporations who ship their profits out of the United States, that raises $260 billion in these tax havens.
You know, there are 30 corporations in America of Fortune 500 making billion—I'm—I come from the corporate capital of the world, Delaware. Not a joke. More corporations are incorporated in Delaware than all the rest in America combined. Okay? Well, guess what? Fifteen of the Fortune 500 companies last year paid—I mean, 30—excuse me—paid zero taxes, and they made billions of dollars. Paid not a penny in tax, not a single cent.
I'm not trying to punish anybody. I'm just saying, ""Let's be fair."" If you just set up a minimum tax—you had to pay at least 15 percent of your earnings as a corporation—that alone would raise $230 billion.
The point is, I have never had a reputation of being someone who's out there trying to just out-tax people. But here's the deal, folks: I think it's about time there be fairness in the tax code. I don't want you paying more than your share.
But the tax cut that was passed under Trump—the $2 trillion, not a penny of which was paid for—where did it go? Over 80 percent of it went to the top one-quarter of 1 percent. I think you should be able to be a billionaire. I think you should be able to be a millionaire. But, for God's sake, at least pay. Pay your fair share. Pay your fair share.
Folks, there's a lot of work ahead to finish the job I've just outlined. There'll be more disagreements to resolve, more compromises to forge along the way.
But today, the American people can be proud of Democrats and Republicans; families here in Wisconsin can be proud; Congress can be proud, because this country came together, forged a bipartisan deal—which a lot of has to do with your State—your Senator—that delivers for everybody. We've shown the world, and just as importantly, we've shown ourselves that American democracy can come through. There's nothing—nothing, nothing—beyond our capacity when we come together as one Nation.
So thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you all for who you are and what you do. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.

28-Jun-21,Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Virtual Fundraiser,"Reed, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you for hosting this event and for your generous support. I might note that—I was saying to you when I got to speak to you a few minutes earlier that, you know, you haven't even—we haven't even sat down with each other. You know, anybody who contributed and raised as much funds as you did, everybody expects to be knocking on my door for—you never asked me for a single thing. You've raised an enormous amount of money, and you said: ""The reason why we haven't gotten together, Mr. President, is because we didn't want to distract you. We want you to keep going."" And I'm like—I really mean it. I hope everybody understands that about almost all of you on this call. And I want to thank you for your incredible support.
And, Jaime, I think that Leader Clyburn was correct: You're the right choice for this job. You've been doing outstanding leadership. And let me just say that you're part of something special. We're bound together in one of the most consequential campaigns in the history of this country. It really was a battle for the soul of America.
And I just got back, by the way, from Europe after being there for, I guess, 13 days. I don't—I forget how many days. And I met for 5 days with the G-7 nations. I also—and then there were four others that were there—India, Australia. And I won't go through all the detail; it'd be too boring for you. And then, I went to a NATO meeting with all the NATO representatives there and the heads of state. And then, I went to meet with Putin. Actually, in between, I did the EU.
And here's the bottom line: I think—I know you all understood it: the incredible damage done to us, internationally, by the last outfit that sat in this seat. And I have to say, sitting here tonight, I've lived through what we've lived through. We know just how important it was. It turns out it was even more important than I thought it was.
Think about the last 150 days: The American Rescue Plan delivered shots in the arms. And by the way, we are in a position where we're getting close to making sure that 70 percent of all the people in America will have been fully vaccinated or at least get one shot by the—by Independence Day. We're way ahead. No one thought we could ever do that.
And I'm in the process of being able to announce very shortly that we're going to generate—half a billion doses we're going to give away between—after taking care of every single American. Half a billion doses give away to the poorest countries in the world. And that's what you do when you want to really help and influence people around the world.
And we put—and—but beyond that, they—you know, the act put shots in arms and checks in pockets for hundreds of millions of Americans who are on the edge. It's keeping food on the table, a roof over their heads. And maybe the thing I'm proudest of is, it's putting us back on track to cut child poverty in half.
A hundred and fifty million Americans are fully vaccinated now. The fastest job growth in the first 4 months, I'm told—not because of me, but because of all of you—of any previous Presidency. Projected economic growth at nearly 7 percent, the highest in four decades.
And just last week, I announced a bipartisan agreement in the Senate asking to make one of the biggest investments ever in infrastructure—ever—rebuilding our roads and bridges; delivering high-speed internet to every American family, rural and as well as in urban areas; delivering every clean water, getting rid of those lead pipes to every American; building a more resilient power grid; installing electric vehicle charging stations, over half a million of them. This is the largest investment in public transit ever and the largest investment in rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago. It's about creating millions of good-paying jobs, and it's about our economic competitiveness.
You all know better than I, because you're all successful people, that we're in a race in the 21st century to—who's going to have a strongest economy in the 21st century. And the rest of the world is not waiting around. We have more to do, and we have to move fast and move quickly.
This is a—and this agreement, this infrastructure bill that—you know, it signals in the world that we can function, we can deliver. We can do significant things and show that America is back. That's the message I delivered and received during the trip in Europe. I announced that America is going to help vaccinate the world, because that's who we are. That's what we can do.
I also rallied our European allies to holding China to the same rules of the road in a global economy in the 21st century.
I made clear to President Putin and Russia that the relationship between America and Russia should be stable and predictable. We should be able to cooperate where we have our interests, on nuclear nonproliferation and climate change. And where we have differences, I made it clear to President Putin that I understand why—we have to understand what exists, and whether it's on cyber attacks or interference in our economy, I will respond. I will respond. And I know we'll respond to specific kinds of actions that harm U.S. interests.
The bottom line of all this at home and abroad: We're proving that our democracy can deliver for the people when autocrats are betting we can't.
But we've got a lot more to do. As we invest in our physical infrastructure, we also have to invest in our human infrastructure, the so-called Biden Family Plan bill. We're going to move on the American Family Plan that will deliver childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K, 2 years of community college, and so much more.
And I will take the case to the American people on the need to protect the sacred right to vote. It's under assault in ways that I haven't seen in my entire career, and that's what got me involved in the first place. It's about who gets to vote and whether the vote counts. And we have a system that does both with integrity and independence. But the Republicans want to do what no political party has ever tried to do: get to decide if your vote counts. It's outrageous. We're going to fight like hell to make sure that doesn't happen.
There's so much to say on all of these subjects. I'm sorry—[inaudible]—such shorthand.
But to work—the work has not been easy, and I'm going to need all of you to help do that work. The DNC is going to need you, because here's the deal: We won in 2020 as a unified party, and we need to stay unified and keep doing the big consequential things.
If we make the right decisions in the next 4—[inaudible]—years, in 50 years, people will look back and say this was the moment that America won the future. But we can't do it without you. And it's not hyperbole to suggest what I said—that America won the future.
So look, there's so much more to say, but the bottom line is that there's so much at stake. But I promise you—I promise you—I've heard from almost every major world leader—I've heard from every major world leader: We can do this. So we can, in the process, be helping the rest of the world by doing well for ourselves.
May God bless America, and may God protect our troops. And I look forward to meeting you all in a virtual photo line, which I guess is going to begin very shortly.","NOTE: The President spoke at 6:59 p.m. from the Residence at the White House.

28-Jun-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Reuven Rivlin of Israel and an Exchange With Reporters,"President Biden. Well, I'm really happy to have President Rivlin here. And I don't want to—it's not technically appropriate, but I'm so delighted his daughter is here. She's in the back right there. And I got to meet her and talk about our kids and grandkids and all the like.
At any rate, I just want to thank the President for being here and for your dedication to strengthening the relationship between the United States and Israel.
President Rivlin. Thank you.
President Biden. And as the American press here can tell you, my commitment to Israel is—well, they can't tell you anything actually; they're not supposed to—but it's ironclad. It's real. It's something that—I often say, if there weren't an Israel, we'd have to invent one.
And so this includes, we're—you know, we're committed to—unwavering commitment to your self-defense. And today we're going to be discussing a broad range of challenges, including Iran. What I can say to you: Iran will never get a nuclear weapon on my watch, as they say.
President Rivlin. God bless you.
President Biden. And you know, the—I directed last night's airstrikes targeting sites used by the Iranian-backed militia groups responsible for recent attacks on the U.S. personnel in Iraq. And I have that authority under Article II. And even those up in the Hill who are reluctant to acknowledge that have acknowledged that's the case.
I also want to be clear that, as I said, my team and I are already working closely with the Israeli Government to—that took office earlier this month. I'm looking forward to hosting Prime Minister Bennett at the White House very soon. And the U.S. fully supports normalization of the relationship between Israel and Middle Eastern countries—that you're making some headway on—and Africa as well.
And beyond, the important progress we are really looking forward to building back a wider block of peace and stability. And, going forward, Mr. President, the United States and Israel are going to continue to work together to advance peace in the region and stability.
And I've only one regret: You're leaving as President. But not immediately, and not soon.
President Rivlin. Seven years, for Israel, is enough. For the Americans, 8 years could be——
President Biden. Eh—[laughter].
President Rivlin. ——a little bit longer. But for the Israelis, 7 years, it's enough.
President Biden. Well, welcome.
President Rivlin. It's good to be President, I must say to you. Yes.
President Biden. [Laughter] Well, you've done incredibly well. You've been a great friend.
President Rivlin. I did. Absolutely.
President Biden. You've been a great friend.
President Rivlin. I did my best, of course.
President Biden. Well, you did your best, and it was as good as it could be.
President Rivlin. Thank you. There was——
President Biden. All right, everybody. You have anything else you'd like to say?
President Rivlin. Of course, I would like to say and to mention that I'm delighted—really delighted—to be here once again in the White House meeting you, the President of the United States.
Of course, I have to repeat what we know very well: Israel have no greater friend, ally than the United States of America. You are our best friends, and we are sharing—we are best friends, and the bonds between the people of Israel and the people of America is based on the understanding that we are sharing values: values of democracy and values of liberalism.
And because of that, of course, we, according to a real friendship, can from time to time discuss matters. And even the—agree not to agree about everything. But we count on you. And your, really, declaration just now really brought the Israelis to understand that we have a great friend at the White House.
President Biden. You do.
President Rivlin. Mr. President, God bless you, God bless the people of America, and God bless the relationship between our two nations and to our two states.
President Biden. Well, I agree with you. And I thank you very much for being here.
President Rivlin. Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you all very much.

25-Jun-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation Abdullah Abdullah of Afghanistan and an Exchange With Reporters,"President Biden. Well, it's good to see two old friends. We met many, many times in Afghanistan for long hours. And they're welcome here. They've had a chance to meet with the—all the major players of the administration—from the Secretary of Defense, to the CIA—across the board. And it's good to have them here in the White House.
The partnership between Afghanistan and the United States is not ending. It's going to be sustained. And you know, our troops may be leaving, but support for Afghanistan is not ending, in terms of support and maintenance of their—helping maintain their military, as well as economic and political support.
And they've both got very difficult jobs. Every time I think I've got a lot—tough job, I think, Mr. President——
President Ghani. [Laughter]
President Biden. ——but seriously, I—they're doing important work of trying to bring about unity among Afghan leaders up—across the board.
And they have to—Afghans are going to have to decide their future of what they want—what they want. But it won't be for lack of us being a help. There's going to be a—and the senseless violence that has to stop, but it's going to be very difficult.
But we're going to stick with you. And we're going to do our best to see to it you have the tools you need.
President Ghani. Well, thank you, Mr. President. First of all, let me pay tribute to the 2,448 Americans who paid the ultimate sacrifice, over a million American veterans who have served with honor and dignity for your security and our freedom.
The United States has not spared any effort in blood or treasure during these years. And as a grateful nation, I want to acknowledge that and ask you——
President Biden. Thank you.
President Ghani. ——to thank the Gold Star families.
Second, President Biden's decision has been historic. It has made everybody recalculate and reconsider. We are here to respect it and support it.
Third, we are entering into a new chapter of our relationship where the partnership with the United States would not be military, but comprehensive, regarding our mutual interest. And we're very encouraged and satisfied that this partnership is taking place. Thank you for ordering the priorities.
The Afghan nation is in an 1861 moment, like President Lincoln, rallying to the defense of the republic, determined that the republic is defended. It's a choice of values: the values of an exclusionary system or an inclusionary system. We're determined to have unity, coherence, national sense of sacrifice and will not spare anything.
Just for your information: Today, the Afghan Defense and Security Forces have retaken six districts, both in the south and the north. It's showing our determination. So I hope that nobody does the Bernard Shaw on us, exaggerating our death before something has happened.
Let us understand that in moments of great transition, things happen. But you will see that with determination, with unity, and with the partnership, we will overcome all odds. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Biden. Thank you. Thank you all. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Sentencing of Former Minneapolis, Minnesota, Police Officer Derek Chauvin 
Q. Mr. President, do you have any reaction to Derek Chauvin being sentenced to 22½ years in prison?
President Biden. I've not been able to hear anything about what's happened. How long has he been sentenced?
Q. Twenty-two and a half years.
President Biden. Well, I don't know all the circumstances that were considered, but it seems to me—under the guidelines—that seems to be appropriate.
Thank you.",NOTE: The President spoke at 4:15 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House.,"Joseph R.

25-Jun-21,Remarks at a LGBTQ+ Pride Month Reception,"Well, my name is Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter]
Ashton, thank you. You seemed awfully comfortable up here. [Laughter] You were awfully comfortable up here. I don't know. I'm not sure I'll be around, but you know—[laughter]—if you're here, just don't pretend you don't know me. Okay? [Laughter]
Your story, your leadership, and your mom is an inspiration. Your mom. If my mother were here, she'd look at you and say, ""Honey, God love you, dear."" [Laughter] God love you—what you do, what you did, what you continue to do.
I want to thank Secretary—well, first of all, I want to say to Chasten: Belated happy birthday, Chasten. If you could hear us inside, we were singing happy birthday to him. We got a bunch of cupcakes, but not enough for everybody. [Laughter] But—and, Mr. Secretary, thank you. You are—you're the best, man.
Look, our presence here this afternoon makes a simple, strong statement: Pride is back at the White House. [Applause] Pride is back at the White House. For this community and for our Nation and for the world, Pride Month represents so much. It stands for courage: the courage of all those in previous generations and today who proudly live their truth.
It stands for justice: both the steps we've taken and the steps we need to take. And above all, Pride Month stands for love—you know, being able to love yourself, love whomever you love, and love this country enough to make it more fair and more free and more just.
You know, during the campaign, Tim Gill and Scott Miller—and Tim—one of them is here today, I don't want to embarrass him; he always gets mad when I do that—[laughter]—brought me and Jill to visit the Stonewall Inn. I wanted to go, and they wanted—they offered to take me. We wanted to pay tribute to that hallowed ground that represents the fight to ensure that all people are treated with dignity and respect.
Just a few minutes ago, surrounded by the survivors of family members who were—we've lost, I signed a bill consecrating another piece of hallowed ground: the Pulse nightclub. And I want to thank all of the Members of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate for standing up and making sure that will never be forgotten. Never be forgotten. The site of the deadliest attack affecting the LBT—LGBTQ+ community in American history. It's now a national memorial.
This month, on the way to the office, I walk through—from my—from the Residence to the Oval Office every morning—I walk through a hallway lit with rainbow colors of Pride, which you'll have a chance to see in just a few minutes. You'll see a candle carried during the AIDS vigil in the early nineties by a pair—and a pair of sandals belonging to Matthew Shepard.
They're reminders of how much this community has suffered and lost. But they're also reminders of this community's incredible resiliency, the incredible contributions, the incredible—including, we just saw, the National Football League and the National Women's Soccer League.
All of you here—Henry Muñoz and Kyle—good to see you, man—[laughter]. I had the—I had the opportunity to officiate at their wedding. [Laughter] And Representative Malcolm Kenyatta—where are you, Malcolm? You're around here some—good to see you, man. And Dr. Matt Miller—they stole the show at the Democratic Convention. [Laughter]
And my friend, Sarah McBride—where is Sarah? Sarah? Sarah worked closely with my son Beau when he was attorney general of the State of Delaware and is now serving Delaware, as well, as one of the first openly transgender State legislators in history. Senator. You just heard from our history-making Secretary of Transportation. And we have today the first openly transgender person ever confirmed to the U.S. Senate—you just met her—Dr. Levine.
Representation matters. Recognition matters. But there's something else that matters: Results. Results. I am proud to lead the most pro-LGBTQ equality administration in U.S. history. And even on the very—my very first day in office, the first Executive order I signed was to change the whole of the Federal Government to commit to work aggressively to root out discrimination against LBT—LGBTQ+ people and their families. That was the first Executive order.
I ordered our agencies—every agency—to rapidly implement the Supreme Court's ruling in Bostock, which affirmed that civil rights protections on the basis of sex apply to sexual orientation and gender identity.
And as a result of that Executive order, the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs [Development]* announced that it would be—take steps to protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in housing and ensured critical protections for transgender Americans experiencing homelessness.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced it would work to combat discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in credit and lending. The Department of Health and Human Services announced it would protect against discrimination in health care services.
And just last week, the Department of Education made clear that title IX protections apply to sexual orientation and gender identity and prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ students in our Nation's schools.
And a moment ago, I signed an Executive order to advance diversity, equality, and inclusion, and accessibility across the entire Federal workforce. The order directs the entire Federal Government to eliminate barriers so people from every background and walk of life have an equal opportunity to serve our Nation, including LGBTQ+ folks and all employees in underserved communities.
Look, I also was proud to rescind the discriminatory and un-American ban on openly transgender servicemembers. Today we're joined by Lieutenant Colonel Bree Fram. Bree, Colonel—thank you. One of the highest ranking openly transgender servicemembers in the United States military. Lieutenant Colonel Fram, thank you for your service to our Nation. We owe you. Thank you.
And everyone who has served—everyone deserves the absolute high quality of health care. That's why I was so pleased that, last week, Secretary McDonough announced the Department of Veterans Affairs is beginning the process to provide more comprehensive gender-affirming care to our Nation's transgender—for our Nation's transgender veterans.
We're also making equality the centerpiece of our diplomacy around the world. We believe LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. In February, I signed a Presidential memorandum establishing that it's the policy of the United States to pursue an end to violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
This month, Pride flags are flying—as some of my friends in our last—in the Obama-Biden administration who are openly gay—they are flying in more than over 130 U.S. Embassies around the world. A powerful—a powerful—symbol of our commitment to safety, dignity, and opportunity for all. And today I'm proud to announce that Jessica Stern, who many of you know, as an LGBT Special—Q+ Special Envoy at the State Department.
And yes, we're also making progress, but I know we still have a long way to go, a lot of work to do. But we must protect the gains we've made and fend off the cruel and unconscionable attacks we're seeing now to ensure that everyone enjoys the full promise of equality and dignity and protection.
When I was Vice President, I was proud—although, some—it won't surprise some people in the administration at the moment—[laughter]—and by the way, I did tell the President that I would not go out and proselytize, but if I was asked, I would not remain quiet. [Laughter] The President—I was proud to have called for marriage equality, along with Barack Obama, because, at the time, I said, ""Love is love, period.""
Six year ago, tomorrow, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality, we're all reminded of the White House lit up in rainbow colors. Shortly thereafter, I went to New York to celebrate with my friend Evan Wolfson and a team from—at Freedom To Marry. The joy was palpable.
But we knew then, as we know now, that our work is unfinished. When a same-sex couple can be married in the morning, but denied a lease in the afternoon for being gay, something is still wrong. Over half of our States—in over half of our States, LGBTQ+ Americans still lack explicit State-level civil rights protections to shield them from discrimination.
As I said as a Presidential candidate and in my first joint address to Congress, it's time for the United States Senate to pass the Equality Act and put the legislation on my desk. Put it on my desk. Harvey Milk was right when he said, quote, ""It takes no compromise to give people their rights."" It takes no compromise to give people their rights.
And by the way, this bill doesn't just protect LGBTQ+ people. It's also going to strengthen existing civil rights protections for people of faith, people of color, people with disabilities, women—in public accommodations, like doctors' offices, parks, and gyms. I want to thank the leaders of the Congressional Equity [Equality]* Caucus for their continued work to make it happen. The Equality Act will also help protect against the disturbing proliferation of anti-LGBTQ bills we're seeing in State legislatures.
So far this year, hundreds of anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in State legislatures. More than a dozen of them have already passed—more than a dozen of them. These are some of the ugliest, most un-American laws I've seen, and I've been here awhile. Many of them target transgender children, seeking to prevent them from receiving the appropriate medical care; for using the bathroom at high schools while they're—the one where they'll be most safe; even preventing them from joining sports teams with their classmates. Let's be clear: This is nothing more than bullying disguised as legislation.
As I've said before, many times, transgender kids are some of the bravest people in the world. I mean it sincerely. You just saw it with Ashton, and you'll see it with several other young people here. It takes courage to be true to your authentic self and to face—in the face of the—these kinds of discrimination you know exist. It takes a toll.
We know more than half of transgender youth seriously considered suicide just in the past year. These young people aren't hurting anyone, but these laws are hurting them. And they've got to stop.
Our deceased son Beau, when he was Delaware's attorney general, was one of the first AGs in the country to call for legislation to establish legal protections on the basis of gender identity to protect—to protect trans people—trans people. And now the Department of Justice has filed statements of interest in cases challenging two of these—those bills that got passed—explaining why they're so unconstitutional.
So we have to work. We have to work to do so much in these areas to support seniors, aging in isolation without support; to confront disproportionate levels of homelessness and poverty and unemployment in the LGBTQ community; to address the epidemic level of violence against transgender people, especially transgender women—as has been mentioned before, women of color—in the coming days, my administration is going to have more to say about that; and to finally eradicate the AIDS epidemic.
I'm not sure I'm allowed to talk about this—[laughter]—but our son Beau, who was a decorated war veteran and attorney general of the United—of the State of Delaware and should be standing here instead of me, came home from war after a year in Iraq and, before that, 6 months in Kosovo. And what he did—he decided he was going to set up a foundation for LGBTQ youth, but primarily focusing on transgender youth.
And he took all the money left from the campaign—he was going to run for Governor—and put it in and a lot more. Because in his working with everyone from YMCAs to all the areas where young people can find some solace—his buddy Chris Coons and my buddy Senator Coons knows what he's done.
The point is: A lot of transgender youth—those who commit suicide—based on the studies his foundation has done, do it because their mom doesn't understand, because mom or dad says, ""You can't be here anymore""—are rejected. So, folks, we've got a lot of work to do. A lot of it's basically public education.
Let me close with this: When you go downstairs, you'll see some of the Smithsonian exhibit. You get a sense of the long, long journey and how long it's been and how far we've come—have you come. But how much further we have to go.
So this afternoon we celebrate. But tomorrow we go back to work. Progress won't come easily; it never has. But we're going to stand strong, stand together. And I promise you, we will succeed. I promise you.
I said to folks earlier, you know things are—why—I always get asked by the press, ""Why are you so optimistic, Biden?"" Well, as my neurosurgeon once said, I'm probably a congenital optimist. But beyond that—[laughter]—it's a simple proposition.
Look at the young people: straight and gay, doesn't matter. They're the least prejudiced—this generation—the most open, the most giving, and the best educated generation in history. It's a fact. In all of history. And look where they are. Look how it's changing. It's changing in ways that—in my generation, 270 years ago—[laughter]—you'd get beat up for defending somebody.
But really and truly, there's a great reason for hope. And so much talent—so much talent can be unleashed by embracing the LGBT+ community—Q+ community.
So I want to thank you and say: Happy Pride. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 2:39 p.m. in the East Room at the White House.

25-Jun-21,Remarks on Signing Legislation To Designate the National Pulse Memorial,"The President. I'm Joe Biden. I'm Jill's husband. [Laughter]
Collapse of the Champlain Towers South Condominium Building in Surfside, Florida 
Before I sign, let me start with a few words about what's going on now in Florida. And you know, the people who are here, who were part of what happened that night at the Pulse nightclub and the scores that I just spoke to a moment ago—they're online looking at this—they understand that—what it's like to have to wait and wonder what happened.
The families—I remember going down there to the Pulse nightclub afterwards—and wondering: ""Is it my son, my daughter, my husband, someone I love—is that who got lost?"" Because you didn't know for certain initially.
And as Congressman Cicilline knows, there's nothing worse than having to wait and wonder what happened. And I know, Val, when you were a police chief, you had to go through waiting a lot as well.
And so I just want to say, I've spoken to Governor DeSantis. And we've provided all the help that they have—they need. We sent the best people from FEMA down there. We're going to stay with them; with the disaster declaration we made, provide for everything from housing to, God forbid, whether there's a need for moratoria—if there are—to—for the bodies to be placed. Everything in between.
And—but I just want to say—and I'm sure I speak for all the Members of the Congress here today and all the survivors here that it's a tough, tough time. There's so many people waiting. ""Are they alive? Will they be—what will happen?"" And so our heart goes out to them.
And I—to the people of Florida, I want to—I've spoken to Debbie Wasserman Schultz. I've spoken to most of the folks down there and member—in authority. And I promise you, the administration, the Congress, we're doing everything possible to be of assistance now and after this occurs—after they decide exactly what the state of play is.
Legislation To Designate the National Pulse Memorial 
But I'm glad to welcome everyone here to the adjunct to the White House here, and in person and virtually: survivors and family members, victims, and the path-breaking leaders like Senator Baldwin.
Just over 5 years ago, the Pulse nightclub, a place of acceptance and joy, became a place of unspeakable pain and loss. And we'll never fully recovery, but we'll remember. And we have to—what we're going to do is what the Members of Congress here did and enshrine in law—as a consequence of that law, enshrine, in perpetuity, literally a monument to the loss that occurred there, and an absolute determination that we're going to deal with this every single, solitary day and make sure that we're not in a position to see this happen again.
Behind me, you see, on either board there, the 49 lives lost: family members, parents, friends, veterans, students, young, Black, Asian, Latino—all fellow Americans. And in their memory and for the countless others forever scarred is why I sign this today.
And let me say how much I appreciate it—and I mean this sincerely—the commitment of the Members of the House and Senate to make sure that we don't forget—that this isn't forgotten.
Now, there's a tradition when a bill is signed that the President gives a signing pen to each of the people who had something to do with the law or the decision being made in the first place.
I promise you, I have all the pens, but they're in the other room. I couldn't figure how to sign—[laughter]—sign them all. But don't leave without the pen. Okay? All right? All right.
Representative Mark A. Takano. Thank you, Mr. President.
Representative Darren M. Soto. Thank you, Mr. President.
[At this point, the President signed the bill.]
The President. May we never have to sign another—no President ever have to sign another monument like this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And one last thing, as I said to—to the survivors and their—those who lost folks, a little earlier, in private: You know, what the Congress has done means a great deal, and it's important. But it's really hard; it brings back everything as if it happened yesterday.
And every time there's a memorial service for our son Beau, you know, you're flattered. You feel good about it. You think it's wonderful—the recognition. But it's tough. It's as if it happened yesterday, it happened the day before, it happened the moment you're signing it.
So I want to thank the folks who are here and the folks who are survivors who are on Zoom with us. I want to thank them for their courage—I really mean it—for their courage.
But, I promise you, none of the Members of Congress that are here, nor I, nor Jill are going to let up until we deal with equity across the board.
Thank you so very much.

24-Jun-21,"Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts in Raleigh, North Carolina","The President. Hello, Raleigh. I'm going to——
Audience member. [Inaudible]—Joe!
Audience member. [Laughter] We love you!
The President. Love you back. Well, look, that old—I—you're—by the way, you're in the midst of the—you're in the presence of a—one hell of an individual I want you all to know about. Not me. [Laughter] He's always there when people need help, and he particularly focuses on people who are left behind: Reverend Barber. Thanks for all you do, Rev.
Ivy, I thank you for that introduction, you know, and for everything you're doing.
You know, I think—I thank you everyone here at the Green Road Community Center for hosting us. Governor Cooper, my good friend. A great Governor. But the most important thing: He's a man of enormous integrity, and—no, he really is. You're doing an incredible job; I'm lucky to have you as a partner, Gov, and as we move along here.
Look, you know, the main thing I want to do is start off with the way you should never start off. Are they—do you have chairs out there? [Laughter] Well, if you have a chair, sit. Don't stand for me. [Laughter] I was getting the—I was getting to feel really guilty, man. [Laughter]
I said that a while ago, as the press will tell you. About a year ago, I said, ""Why doesn't everybody sit down?"" And somebody in the front said: ""I don't have a damn seat. That's why."" [Laughter] I want to get in trouble. Thank you. I thought you didn't have any seats there. I was going to really feel guilty.
Folks, look, it's great to be with Mayor Baldwin of Raleigh and Mayor—Mayor Schewel of Durham. And joined by a proud native son of North Carolina: the Administrator of the EPA in Washington, DC, Michael Regan. Where are you, Michael? I'm always worried when I come back to North Carolina and Michael is with me that the Governor is going to take him back. [Laughter] But I need him.
Look, folks, he's doing one heck of a job at EPA. And if you want to talk about health, think about the environment. Think about what's happened—being done—what we're changing at EPA. And the—it makes a big deal.
It's also out there, across the State, encouraging people to get vaccinated as well. I wanted to come to Raleigh to thank everyone in this room for everything you're doing to get your community vaccinated. It matters. It matters. You're saving lives. That's not hyperbole.
Let me remind everybody: We lost 600,000 dead in America in about a year. That's more than every life lost in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam war, Iraq, Iran, across the board—Afghanistan. More lives lost in a year than every major war in the 20th century and the 21st century. And guess what, folks? There've been lives lost all around the world.
And, America, I might say—this is not—I didn't plan on saying this, but I'm going to anyway: We have an obligation in the United States of America to live up to who we are. America is the only—is a unique nation. We're the only nation formed based on an idea—an idea—not an ethnicity, not an ideology, not a—idea: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, et cetera.
Audience member. Yes.
The President. Well, here's the deal. Here's the deal. There are over a hundred countries in the world that have no capacity to help themselves right now. None.
And that's why—I got somewhat criticized, but that's why I've worked so darn hard—after being able to nail down, in the first 100 days, over 60 [600]* million doses of vaccine for Americans, I went to Europe to meet what they call the ""G-7"" and then with NATO and then with the EU. And I promised that the United States, in the remainder of this year and the first half of next year, is going to provide a billion doses to the rest of the world. A billion doses. A half a billion of those will be done between now and January and the first half of next year.
The point being: I wanted the Nation to reflect what you all reflect. Everyone in this room, there's everything—you—I want to thank you for all you're doing. But the rest of the world is in trouble as well. We have to look out for one another. We really do.
And what you're doing here—go back to the United States—nonprofits directing folks to where to go; houses of worship opening onsite vaccination for congregants; my friend Reverend Barber is here, as I said, and countless faith leaders whose—who are truly doing God's work; college students providing rides for seniors.
So what's happening in America is what America is all about. That's what the rest of world is looking at: Are we what we advertise ourselves to be? It's because of people like you, here in Raleigh and in communities across America, that we're going to win this fight.
Look at the progress we made so far. Today, 66 percent of all American adults have gotten at least one shot. That includes 87 percent of all seniors of all colors; 75 percent of adults ages 40 and up have gotten a shot; and 70 percent of those age 30 and up.
Nationwide, we're seeing the lowest number of daily cases and deaths since the first day of the pandemic. And we've built equity into the heart of the vaccination program. I put together a vaccination team, headed by a really bright guy, and we put together a group of 23 doctors. And what they did was, we had one doc who does nothing but deal with equity—access for people.
There's a reason why it's been harder to get African Americans, initially, to get vaccinated: because they're used to be experimented on—the Tuskegee Airmen and others. People have memories. People have long memories. It's awful hard, as well, to get Latinx vaccinated as well. Why? They're worried that they'll be vaccinated and deported.
So look, from day one, something that Governor Cooper has been totally focused on is making sure we get as many people vaccinated, particularly people who don't have access to health care usually; who don't have ordinary—don't have doctors or family physicians, et cetera.
Seventy-three percent of the shots administered at community health centers through the Federal program we have and more than 58 percent of the shots administered in federally run vaccination sites have gone to people of color. It makes a gigantic difference. And across the Nation, people of color have accounted for more than half of all the vaccinations in the last month. The more we close the racial gap in vaccination rates, the more lives we can save.
And if I can pause for one second: That's why I've called for spending billions of dollars at NIH focusing on new ways to deal with obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer, and cancer—focus just on those diseases—money that private drug companies don't have the money to invest in or the inclination to. Because guess what? In most Black communities across America and Hispanic communities, how many stores have fresh vegetables? How many stores have a—I'll go down the list. It matters. The health condition a person enters this fight over makes a big difference as to what, in fact, is going to be able to be done.
Here in North Carolina, my administration has provided $105 million from the emergency—Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to help get people vaccinated. Working with the Governor and the mayors and county officials across the State, there are 240 personnel in the Tar Heel State just to put the needle in somebody's arm.
This has been a gigantic—a gigantic—logistical challenge not just in North Carolina, but all across America. More than 660 National Guard members have supported the COVID-19 response here in North Carolina. Over in Greensboro, we stood up the Federal vaccination site that alone has administered 135,000 shots.
The Governor and I visited one of the mobile units you're deploying to meet the people where they live. And as a result of these efforts Statewide, case deaths are down over 90 percent in the last 5 months.
All of this is great news. But here's the deal: For all the progress we've made as a country, hospitalizations and deaths are down drastically in places where people are getting vaccinated. The data couldn't be clearer: If you're vaccinated, you're safe. You are still at risk of getting seriously ill or dying if you, in fact, have not been vaccinated. That's just a fact.
And this new, dangerous variant that continues to emerge, it's now the most common variant in America and here. And unvaccinated people are incredibly vulnerable. This is a serious concern with what experts call the ""Delta"" variant. It is not only—according to the CDC, between 10 to 20 percent of all cases in the last 2 weeks have been the Delta variant.
Dr. Fauci has made it clear—he and my wife have been traveling the country to make this case—that it's more easily transmittable, this Delta variant, potentially deadlier, and especially dangerous for young people—for young people. He says it's the greatest threat to our fight to beat COVID-19.
But the good news is, we have a solution. The science is clear. The best way to protect yourself against the virus and its variants is to be fully vaccinated. It works. It's free. It's safe. It's easy. It's convenient.
Over 150 million Americans have gotten fully vaccinated, and they're safe and protected now and even including against the Delta variant. They're getting back to living their lives and spending time with their loved ones. But we need more people to get fully vaccinated to finish the job. That's why I'm here.
I called for June to be the ""Month of Action"" to get folks vaccinated so we can all enjoy a Fourth of July with our independence from the virus—from the virus. If you're already vaccinated, make sure your family and friends are vaccinated. Help them make a plan to get vaccinated.
If you've gotten your first shot, make sure you get your second one to be fully protected. It's a big deal.
Audience member. Right!
The President. And if you're not vaccinated, don't put it off any longer. Just do it.
Audience member. Yeah!
The President. Just do it. And it's never been easier. It's never been easier to do it.
Text your ZIP Code to 438829—438829. And immediately, it will pop up to find the vaccination sites closest to you. And hardly anyone is beyond 5 miles from a potential site.
Get a free ride to and from your vaccination sites. I want to publicly thank—when I asked for help, both Lyft or Uber said between the time—this last month to July 4, they'll provide a ride free to and from. They'll wait and take you back home.
Thousands of pharmacies are offering no-appointment, walk-in vaccinations. More than 1,400 pharmacies are in North Carolina that do that. They've already administered over 2.2 million shots, these pharmacies. Many of them are open 24 hours on Fridays.
So go tomorrow if you've not gotten it done. Or when you're going out, knocking on doors, tell them, ""Tomorrow, 24 hours, a majority of these drugstores are open."" Get it done. Get it done and get it done at their convenience.
And if you still have questions, that's okay. Talk to people who you know who have gotten the shot. That's what you guys are out there—going to be doing, knocking on doors. Talk to your doctor or your health provider. If you don't have one, physicians know it's the right choice to get vaccinated to protect themselves, their patients, and their communities.
And listen to North Carolina's own Dr. Kizzy Corbett, you know, from Hurdle Mills, just about an hour north from here. She's a scientist at NIH that I met several weeks ago who helped develop the COVID-19 vaccine, a vaccine that was developed after decades of research under Republican and Democratic administrations. As I said, I met her earlier this year during a tour of the NIH Vaccine Research Center where this all happened. She's incredible.
Folks, there is no reason to leave yourself vulnerable to the deadly virus for 1 single day more. And as they say in my church, I'm preaching to the choir, I know. [Laughter] But the television is recording this. [Laughter] Make the case. Let people know getting vaccinated is not only maybe going to save their lives, but save their mother, their father, their child, their son, their daughter, their coworker.
So, please, please get vaccinated. And let everyone do our part. Let's everyone do it.
This weekend, we will be hosting another nationwide canvassing event where volunteers like you are going to knock on doors and talk to their friends and neighbors and help finish the job of getting America vaccinated.
To join that effort, I say to the people watching this—because these people have already joined the effort: To join that effort, please visit wecandothis.HHS.governor—.gov, excuse me—wecandothis.HHS.gov. Sign up. Get involved. We can do this. We really can do this.
Let me close where I began. To all of you here today who are about to head out and canvass your communities: Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I genuinely mean it. But just listen again to Ivy—graduated from Apex Friendship High, just finished her first year in school. She's been spending her summer doing door-to-door—going door to help get people vaccinated to stay safe.
And I'll bet what she had to say, when asked, is what a lot of you think as well. She said, quote—I hope you don't mind my repeating this, Ivy—but she said, quote: ""Reaching out and giving back to the community is everything. I like to say . . . I don't dream of having a dream job or a dream career, but I dream of truly helping people in the best way I can . . . that's my life goal.""
This can be among one of the most important things you do. I really mean it. And again, remember—I think you're probably the least ones that have to remember—remember: 600,000-plus Americans have died—600,000-plus Americans have died. This Delta variant—you know there's going to be others as well. You know what's going to happen. We've got to get our young people vaccinated.
So talk to those moms when you knock on the door. Tell them about—tell them about—why it's so important to get their children.
You may remember, I got widely criticized when I suggested we keep dropping the age of people eligible for vaccinations. It's been based on the science. I didn't do anything based on a whim. The science, the tests show that.
And what's going to happen here, I predict, as soon as we go from temporary approval to permanent approval—which just takes time; it's not that it's—don't think it's there—it's going to increase the number of people willing to move as well.
So, Ivy, thank you for representing the best of us. Thank all of you for representing the best of us. You've all got the whole world in front of you. And you know, it's because of—it's because of people like Ivy and all of you why I have so much faith in the future.
I'm not being—you know, if you notice, I've been unfairly criticized for being optimistic. I've been fairly criticized because I think we can actually pull people together. I ran—when I ran for President, I ran for three reasons. I said, one, is restore the soul of America—just basic decency, looking out for one another.
And, two, because we had to rebuild the backbone of this country that had been so damaged, which is the middle class——
Audience member. That's right!
The President. ——working class folks and middle class folks. It was about time to build the economy from the middle up and out and from the middle class up. That's what we have to do.
Folks, let's really let this be the summer of joy and freedom. Let it really happen. Let's celebrate the Fourth of July with the independence from the virus. We can get this done. We—no, we really can get this done, and we really can do it.
But you know what? I said the third reason I was running was to unify the country.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Well, folks, it's never been as divided as it is today—never been as divided as it is today, since the Civil War.
And, folks, it's such a waste of talent, such a waste of time. And the rest of the world is looking at us. The rest of the world is wondering whether or not can we really lead the world again. The last 4 years have been devastating to our leadership around the world. I'm not making this—but it's true.
But here's the way we lead: Like you always lead—those who lead better than I and others—you lead by example, and the example is twofold. And I'll end with this. One is making sure we do everything in our power to walk that extra mile, to knock on that door, to pick up the phone, to actually pull up in your own vehicle and take someone who needs to get to a vaccination site. Convince them. Let them know why it's so important. Let them know. Because people respond to individual relationships, even new ones. ""I got it. My brother got it. My sister got it. I took my daughter, and she got it,"" et cetera.
And secondly, let the world know that when it comes down to lifesaving initiatives, no matter where they are—but they come from us—we should share them with the world—the whole world. We're even giving some of these vaccines to nations that are not our friends, because the people are not the ones who are not our friends—the leadership.
So, folks, there's a lot we can do. As I said, I have faith in your generation. The reason I'm so optimistic is because you're the most incredible generation in American history. I'm not being solicitous. Number one, you're the least prejudiced generation in history, number one.
Number two, you volunteer than most—any other generation, including my vaulted generation of the sixties. [Laughter] You—no, I mean it. We are proud of what we did, but you volunteer.
Number three, you're the best educated generation in the history of America.
And I believe our dealing with equity is only the beginning as it relates to vaccine. The first executive order I signed was insisting that every one of my Cabinet members focus on racial equity—because we have a—we have a chance—we have a chance to make significant change in this country, and it's going to come from what you guys do. I really mean it. I can't thank you enough.
Sorry to take so much of your time, but God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 5:33 p.m. at the Green Road Community Center. In his remarks, he referred to William J.

24-Jun-21,Remarks on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Please, please be seated. I've got my notes here. Well, good afternoon. If you hear a little noise in the background, it's because I'm supposed to be getting on a helicopter to head to North Carolina, which I'm going to be doing shortly, right after this. And the Vice President and I, though, want to lay out what we've just settled, at least for the moment, with our friends, the bipartisan group of Senators.
I said many times before: There's nothing our Nation can't do when we decide to do it together, do it as one Nation. Today is the latest example of that truth, in my view. I'm pleased to report that a bipartisan group of Senators—five Democrats, five Republicans, part of a larger group—has come together and forged an agreement that will create millions of American jobs and modernize our American infrastructure to compete with the rest of the world and own the 21st century.
I want to thank them for working together and for raising their ideas and concerns with me and with the Vice President, as well as with our jobs Cabinet: Secretaries Buttigieg is here—good to see you, Mr. Secretary. Secretary Fudge. Secretary Granholm. Secretary—there you are—okay, you guys to make sure I—thought everybody was on this side. I was—[laughter]. Secretary Raimondo and Secretary Walsh.
I also want to thank Senator Shelley Capito for her earlier work on an infrastructure agreement. We didn't reach an agreement, but she tried her best to get something done. I'm sure it helped produce the final agreement we have.
Now, the fact is, investment in jobs and infrastructure have often had bipartisan support in the past. Matter of fact, when I first got to the United States Senate, it was probably the least difficult thing to do—is pass infrastructure plans. But even so, it's been a very long time since the last time our country was able to strike a major bipartisan deal on American infrastructure, which is so badly needed, I might add. We devoted far too much energy to competing with one another and not nearly enough energy competing with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.
The investments we'll be making as a result of this deal are long overdue. They'll put Americans to work in good-paying jobs repairing our roads and our bridges. They'll deliver high-speed internet to every American home, bringing down the price that people pay now for internet service. And they'll close the American digital divide—as been driven home by every mother and father with a child at home during the COVID crisis, that is, thank God, abating. And kids not being able to be in school.
This is going to put plumbers and pipefitters to work. It's going to replace a hundred percent of the Nation's lead water pipes so that every child and every American could turn on the faucet at home or at school and drink clean water, including in low-income communities and communities of color that have been disproportionately affected by lead pipes and the consequences of that.
This deal makes key investments to put people to work all across the country building transmission lines, upgrading the power grid to be more energy efficient and resilient in extreme weather—to be able to sustain extreme weather and the climate crisis. It also builds our natural infrastructure—our coastlines and our levees—to be more resilient as well.
American workers will be installing electric vehicle charging stations and undertaking critical environmental cleanups. This bipartisan agreement represents the largest investment in public transit in American history. And I might add that—the largest investment in rail, since the creation of Amtrak. You all know I have nothing but affection for Amtrak, having traveled over a million miles on it, commuting every day. But it's a big deal.
This agreement is going to create a new financing authority that's going to leverage private capital and infrastructure and clean energy projects that will provide folks with good-paying jobs that can't be outsourced—the kinds of jobs that provide middle class—a middle class life with a little bit of breathing room—a little bit of breathing room—for American families.
My dad used to say, ""Being in the middle class is just being able to take that extra breath."" I mean it sincerely. Think about it. Think about all the people who can't take that breath because they don't—they have no margin for error.
We're—and we're going to do it all without raising a cent from earners below $400,000. There's no gas tax increase, no fee on electric vehicles. And the fact is, we're going to help ensure that—we're going to make sure that everybody in America is in a position to be able to do what need be done.
And so what I've—because—and let me be clear: We're in a race with China and the rest of the world for the 21st century. They're not waiting. They're investing tens of billions of dollars across the board. Tens of billions.
I just came back from Europe with—meeting with the G-7, as well as with NATO, as well as the EU, and as well as with Mr. Putin—all separately. There's massive investment going on in the—among the autocrats. One of the underlying questions is: Can democracies compete with autocratic enterprises in the 21st century? And this is a big move toward that, being able to compete. We have to move, and we have to move fast.
And this agreement singles—signals to the world that we can function, deliver, and do significant things. These investments represent the kind of national effort that, throughout our history, has literally—not figuratively—literally transformed America and propelled us into the future. The transcontinental railroad, the Interstate Highway System—investments that we made together that only our Government was in a position to make.
Now we're poised to add a new chapter in that American tradition. Let me be clear: Neither side got everything they wanted in this deal; that's what it means to compromise. And it reflects something important: It reflects consensus. The heart of democracy requires consensus. And it's time a true—this time a true bipartisan effort, breaking the ice that too often has kept us frozen in place and prevented us from solving the real problems facing the American people.
This deal means millions of good-paying jobs, and fewer burdens felt at the kitchen table and across the country and safer and healthier communities. But it also signals to ourselves and to the world that American democracy can deliver. And because of that, it represents an important step forward for our country.
I want to be clear about something else: Today is a huge day for one-half of my economic agenda, the American Jobs Plan. It delivers on clean transportation, clear water and clean water, universal broadband, clean power infrastructure, and environmental resilience. In these areas, it invests two-thirds of the resources that I proposed in my American Jobs Plan. Two-thirds of what I called for in those areas.
But I'm getting to work with Congress right away on the other half of my economic agenda as well—the American Family Plan—to finish the job on childcare, education, the caring economy, clean energy tax cuts—clean energy, and tax cuts for American families and much more. For me, investment in our physical and human infrastructure are inextricably intertwined. Both make us better off and stronger.
The case for these investments is clear. Economists—left, right, and center—independent Wall Street forecasters, they all say that these kinds of public investments mean more jobs, more workers participating in the labor force, higher productivity, and higher growth for our economy over the long run.
Both need to get done, and I'm going to work closely with Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer to make sure that both move through the legislative process promptly and in tandem. Let me emphasize that: ""and in tandem.""
We need physical infrastructure, but we also need the human infrastructure as well. They're a part of my overall plan. What we agreed on today is what we could agree on: the physical infrastructure. There was no agreement on the rest. We're going to have to do that through the budget process. And we need a fairer tax system to pay for it all. I'm not going to rest until it all—both get to my desk.
And lastly, I know there are some of my party who discouraged me from seeking an agreement with our Republican colleagues, who said that we should, ""Go bigger and go alone."" To them, I say this: I have already shown, in my young Presidency, that I am prepared to do whatever needs to get done to move the country forward. That's what I did with the American Rescue Plan, which was $1.9 trillion.
But let me say this: When we can't—when we can find common ground, though, working across party lines, that is what I will seek to do. The reason why is because broader support for a proposal has—the broader support a proposal has in Congress, the stronger its prospects for passage. Working together when we can allows us to make bipartisan process [progress]* whenever possible without foreclosing the right and the necessity of moving forward on a major—on a majority basis when we are at deep odds with one another, so-called reconciliation progress—process.
And for the deal being announced today, there is plenty of work ahead to bring this home. It's going to require hard work and collaboration. The committee chairs and the ranking members are going to play a major part. There are going to be disagreements to resolve and more compromise to be forged along the way.
But this group of Senators and all of the American people can be proud today because we have reaffirmed, once again, that we are the United States of America. There's not a single thing beyond our capacity that we aren't able to do when we do it together.
I know a lot of you in the press, particularly, doubt that unity is possible, that anything bipartisan is possible. It's hard, but it's necessary. And it can get done.
So I want to thank you all. And God bless you. And now I'll take a few questions, before the helicopter leaves without me, from the press.
Q. Mr. President——
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, what assurances do you have at this point that you have sufficient Democratic support, both in the Senate and the House, to move both on this bipartisan deal and on the reconciliation package?
The President. You always ask me those things.
Q. Yes, sir.
The President. Nobody knows for certain. It's your job, but you know it's not a reasonable question. And the reason I say that—I'm not even being critical—the idea of my telling you now that I know what every Senator—how they're going to vote is just not—I don't know that.
I do know that among the roughly 20 bipartisan groups of Senators and Congress—Senators that I met with—only 10 were here today, but that group—that we had an agreement. For example, you know—and you know, they talk about, ""Well, why would Biden compromise?"" Well, when's the last time—if you had asked me whether or not I'd be able to get passenger rail service or 66 billion dollars' worth, largest investment ever since Amtrak came about. I asked for $90 [billion]* and got $66 billion.
Talk about public transit: $49 billion—$49 billion for public transit. When I raised that before, some of you looked at me like: ""Where have you been, Biden? You've been spending too much in China or something."" I haven't been to China.
You know, electric buses—$7.5 billion. I asked for $15 [billion].* I couldn't get all of it, but I—we compromised. Electric infrastructure—that is charging stations along the roads. I got—I asked for 15; I got 7½. These are significant down payments on things that we finally got after negotiation—skillful negotiation on the part of my Cabinet and my team, led by Mr. Ricchetti.
And so, when you ask me what guarantee do I have that I have all the votes I need: I don't have any guarantee, but what I do have is a pretty good read, over the years, of how the Congress and the Senate works. And the idea that we're not going—because someone is not going to be able to get every single thing they want, they're going to vote against some of the things that I just named with nothing in here that's, quote, ""bad"" for the environment, ""bad"" for the economy, ""bad"" for the transportation is unlikely. But I can't guarantee it. I—you know that.
Yes.
Bipartisanship/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/Climate Resilience/Energy Efficiency and Weatherization 
Q. Mr. President, talk a little more about your interactions with Republicans specifically. You said earlier: ""They've given me their word. Where I come from, that's good enough for me."" To skeptics in your own party, what is it about the conversations you've had recently with Republicans that gives you so much hope?
And secondly, you had said earlier you might have more to say about the situation down in South Beach, in Miami. I'm just curious——
The President. I'm going to stick to—I will, at the end, answer your South Beach question. But let me—so we have some coherence here.
Number one, I've worked with a lot of these people who are in the room. I know them. Everybody knows and you guys know: When certain Senators tell you something, they mean it. And others you take their—you discount.
Where I come from and the—in my years in the Senate, the single greatest currency you have is your word—keeping your word. Mitt Romney has never broken his word to me. You know, the Senator from Alaska and the Senator of New Hampshire, they've never broken their word—or from Maine—they've never broken their word. They're friends.
And so the people I with—was with today are people that I trust. I don't agree with them on a lot of things, but I trust them when they say: ""This is a deal. We'll stick to the deal."" Just like I doubt that you'll find any one of them who say they don't trust me when I said, ""Okay, this is the deal—on these issues, this is a deal we'll stick with.""
But, for example, there's—and I made it clear today—there's other things in the environment I want to get done. I think we should have the $300 billion tax credit for dealing with the environment. It will be a—giant tax cuts for corporations, but it will also be a giant move toward weatherizing every building in America and all the things that we need to do.
So there are things—and so, when I said, ""We agree,"" I'm not going to go back and renegotiate the Amtrak piece, but I am going to fight for trying to get $300 billion more for tax credits for the environment. That's about as best that I can answer the question.
Yes, ma'am.
Economic Stimulus Payments/Tax Relief/Education and Family Assistance Legislation/Voting Rights Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, can you answer a question—thank you so much. My question is on the timeline. There are families who are looking at the Families Plan and wondering when the help is coming. Can you talk—I know you said they're going to be ""promptly and in tandem,"" but can you say anything more about that?
And what does this signal for future deals? There's still things like voting rights and policing reform that are not able to get bipartisan deals. What does this tell you? What have you learned in talking to Republicans about what would happen in the future?
The President. Let me take—you asked three essay questions—[laughter]—and legitimate questions, but you asked three of them. The first one related to what, again?
Q. The first one is on the timeline. When do you think this two-track—[inaudible]?
The President. Timeline. And you said, ""when people are waiting for relief.""
Q. Yes.
The President. I got them——
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. ——$1.9 trillion in relief so far. They're going to be getting checks in the mail that are consequential, this week, for childcare. A lot has been happened already. Number one.
Number two, I'm going to fight like heck to get them the rest of what I think has to be done. On education, for example, my proposal was, in the Family Plan, early education and free community college. I'm going to fight like the devil to get that done, but it's not going to be with Republican help. I'm going to have to get every Democrat and do it through reconciliation if it gets done. So that's number one.
The—I think, based on my being out on the street and polling data, I think the people who need the help the most trust me to be fighting to get them the help they need. They know who I am, and they know my record.
With regard to the issue of what about voting rights——
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Voting rights is maybe the most consequential thing, I think, with—I'm going to be going around the country, spending time making the case to the American people that this just isn't about showing an identification that this is who I am when I vote.
This isn't just about whether or not—excuse me—you can provide water for someone standing in line while they're waiting to vote. This is about who gets to judge whether your vote counted after it's been cast. Think about it.
Up to now, every State and the Federal Government has assumed that there would be officials who were appointed and/or elected in States where the election commissioners—bound by an oath that they would uphold certain requirements to make sure the vote was honest and fair.
What these guys are trying to do now, in rough approximation, is say that, ""If we don't like the vote turned out and we control the State legislature, we're going to say the vote didn't count and we're going to recount."" That's never happened before. It's wrong. ""Who in God's name,"" as my mother would say, ""died and left them boss?"" Your vote has to count when you cast it.
There's a lot of ancillary pieces of this legislation that I strongly support. I strongly support the idea that there's no prior—if I had my way, there'd be no private contributions to see who gets elected—how much money you raise. If I had my way—and I think it's really important—that every election day would be a day off because people can't go to—people who work certain shifts can't make it to the election. I would make sure there's automatic registration when you turn 18.
That's what I think everybody thinks this fight is about—and it's a worthy fight—but it's much more profound than that. It's about saying that the legislature in Georgia could decide, if it's a Republican legislature: ""You know, on reflection, we don't think that election was fair. We're going to vote to say it didn't count."" It's just simply wrong. It's wrong. And in my view, it borders on being immoral.
This is the sacred right to vote. As John Lewis said, ""It is the—the—the most important right you have."" And so I'm going to be making the case across the country and, as best I can, to see it's overturned.
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President——
Q. Mr. President, do you support critical——
The President. Let me go to this side.
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/Education and Family Assistance Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, you said you want both of these measures to come to you ""in tandem."" Did you receive any assurances that that would happen? And how do you anticipate—what will you do if——
The President. I control that.
Q. ——they don't get to you in time?
The President. If they don't come, I'm not signing. Real simple. [Laughter] So, but I expect—I expect that in the—the coming months this summer, before the count—the fiscal year is over, that we will have voted on this bill, as well—the infrastructure bill—as well as voted on the budget resolution.
And that's when they'll—but if only one comes to me, I'm not—and if this is the only thing that comes to me, I'm not signing it. It's in tandem.
The President's Legislative Agenda 
Q. So, Mr. President, do you support, then, Speaker Pelosi's stated plan to hold the bipartisan deal in the House until the Senate also passes reconciliation? Do you support that sequencing on her part?
The President. Yes.
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President——
Q. But, Mr. President, your own party is not on the same page about the reconciliation package. So, by moving forward with this two-track system, are you putting the bipartisan bill in jeopardy?
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
The President. Sure, the bipartisan bill was—look, the bipartisan bill, from the very beginning, was understood, there was going to have to be the second part of it. I'm not just signing the bipartisan bill and forgetting about the rest I—that I proposed. I proposed a significant piece of legislation in three parts. And all three parts are equally important.
And by the way, my party—you keep—everybody tells me my party is divided. Well, my party is divided. My party is divided, but my party is also rational. If they can't get every single thing they want, but all that they have in the bill is that—before them is good, are they going to vote ""no""? I don't think so.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes.
Public Debt Limit/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/The President's Approach to Negotiation 
Q. Mr. President, are you—48 hours ago, it seemed like this deal was in, kind of, a rough place or didn't necessarily have a path forward. What clinched it? What changed the dynamic that you saw? And also, would you be willing to include a debt ceiling increase in either of the two vehicles you're talking about?
The President. There's probably going have to be debt ceiling. Whether it's included in either of these bills is not relevant. It depends on what the leadership in the House and Senate thinks how they should proceed, number one.
Number two, you notice, I didn't have that bleak view you all had. You said, 48 hours ago, it didn't look good. It looked good to me 48 hours ago. It looked good to our team 48 hours ago. Seventy-two hours ago, it looked good too. It wasn't there yet.
But you guys know me too well. And it's—I'm going to drive you crazy the next 4 years, because I'm going to tell you the truth as I see it. I know the Senate and the House better than most of you know it. I've been—my whole life, that's what I've done.
It doesn't mean I'm going to turn out to be right all the time, but I'm not going to negotiate with the press while I'm negotiating with the—in privately with my colleagues. And these are really tough decisions Senators have got. I don't, in any way, dismiss what Senator Murphy says about the environment. I don't dismiss it at all. I just remind him: I wrote the bill on the environment. Why would I not be for it?
The question is: How much can we get done? And the bottom line is: When all is said and done, does what you agree to preclude, forever, you getting the things you really want? Well, I'm not for that. I'm not going to vote for one of those deals.
Secondly, do you get all of what you wanted? Or do you come back and fight another day? I've been President about 150 days. I think we've done fairly well so far. Not because of me, but because of the way the system works.
So it's not—I mean, I—I know that doesn't answer any of your questions about, ""Can you tell me when?"" and ""How are you going to do it?"" I just feel that the best way to get a Senator or a Congressperson who supports the essence of what's already there, but says, ""I don't have enough of what's there, of other things""—the best way to get that message across is go to the constituents and say: ""Here's what's on the table. Do you think your Senator, your Congressman should vote for that?""
So you campaign. The campaign doesn't stop; the partisan piece stops, in terms of, ""I'm against Charlie Smith or Harriet Wilson."" But that doesn't stop—I mean, that stops. But what doesn't stop is just saying, ""You're""—it's like on a—last example I'll give. I promise I won't do this to you again. But remember: In 2018, everybody said: ""Well, you know, we're going to lose. The Democrats are going to lose. You know, the House and Senate, they're not going to make—the House is not going to make gains.""
And I went into over 60 congressional districts. I didn't go after the individual Congresspersons who were against making sure that we kept the Affordable Care Act. But I went to their constituents and said, ""The Affordable Care Act is really important."" We had large crowds show up. And I'd say: ""Here's why I think you should do it. That's why, if I were you, I'd take a look at what Charlie Smith says and Harriet Wilson says. He's for it. She's not."" Or ""She's for it; he's not."" And guess what? We won, what, 40 some seats?
So, it's not just convincing this particular Congressperson. It's making a rational case, if you can, in their communities why this is important to get done.
And I think the fact that I didn't get everything now at this moment—for example, a lot of our housing pieces didn't get passed. We're coming back at it though. We're coming back at it. We're going to make the case. And if I make the case to the public at large—the one thing I can say for all of you, you do accurately report what I say. The problem is I disappoint you because I can't answer all your questions and negotiate with you before I negotiate with my colleagues.
But I really think we—the public understands, and they're seeing the proof is in what's happening. It's now projected our economy is going to grow above 7 percent this year. Projections from Wall Street to the Fed: It's going to continue to grow. We're going to increase more—and guess what?
Remember you were asking me—and I'm not being critical of you all; I really mean this. It was legitimate questions you were asking me—asking me: ""Well, you know, guess what? Employers can't find workers."" I said: ""Yes. Pay them more."" This is an employee's bargaining chip now, what's happening. They're going to have to compete and start playing [paying]* hard-working people a decent wage.
And by the way—talking inflation—the overwhelming consensus is it's going to pop up a little bit and then go back down. No one is talking about, ""This great, great deal.""
So, again, if it turns out that what I've done so far—what we've done so far is a mistake, it's going to show. It's going to show. The economy is not going to grow, like it wasn't before. People aren't going to have jobs with increased pay, like it was before. People are going to be out of work, like it was before, with no options. Unemployment is going to continue to climb, instead of continue to go down. If that happens, then my policies didn't make a lot of sense, but I'm counting on it not. That's my counting how it's working.
I've got to get a helicopter—[inaudible]. Thanks again.
Collapse of the Champlain Towers South Condominium Building in Surfside, Florida/Federal Assistance 
Q. Mr. President, will you travel to Florida, sir?
Q. Can we ask you about Florida—what you've learned and what you've—[inaudible]?
The President. Oh, yes. I apologize. Yes, thank you. [Laughter] Madame Vice President. I've spoken with, coincidentally, the mayor of Miami-Dade was in my office yesterday. And I talked to her today—not about that, obviously—and so I had a long discussion with her today.
I've also spoken with—we've been in contact with the Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who has that district. We've gotten in touch with FEMA. They're ready to go. The Governor is going to have to—we can't—they're—they're down inspecting in what is—what they think is needed. But I'm waiting for the Governor to ask for—declare an emergency if—and especially as we learn more about what the rest—might happen with the rest of the building.
So we are on top of it. We are ready to move, from the Federal resources, immediately—immediately, if in fact we're asked for it. But we can't go in and do it—now, but the—FEMA is down there taking a look at what's needed, and—including from everything from—if the rest of those buildings have to be evacuated as well; finding housing for those people; making sure they have the capacity to both have a place to shelter and food to eat, et cetera.
So that's underway now, and I'm—my Chief of Staff has been deeply involved in this from the very beginning. We've got the Cabinet involved in it now, in terms of dealing with FEMA. We're working on it. And I made it clear that I say to the people of Florida: Whatever help you want that the Federal Government can provide, we're waiting. Just ask us; we'll be there. We'll be there.
So thank you so much. I appreciate it.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris's Visit to the Mexico-U.S. Border

The President. She's done a great job so far. And the reason why it's important that she go down: She's now set up the criteria, having spoken with the President of Mexico and Guatemala, visited the region to know what we need to do.
Thank you very much.
Evacuation of Afghan Interpreters and Other Service Contractors Who Assisted With U.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan

Q. Do you know what country they're going to move to first?
The President. I don't know that. I'll be meeting with the—with Ghani tomorrow, the head—he's coming to my office. That will be a discussion. But they're welcome here, just like anyone else who risked their lives to help us.

Q. Do you have a deal?
Q. Do we have a deal?
Q. How did it go, sir?
The President. Let me get everybody out here. Come on—let me. Rob and—come on. Everybody, come on up.
We had a really good meeting. And to answer your direct question, we have a deal. And I think it's really important—we've all agreed that none of us got what we—all that we wanted. I clearly didn't get all I wanted. They gave more than, I think, maybe they were inclined to give in the first place.
But this reminds me of the days we used to get an awful lot done up at the United States Congress. We actually worked with one—[laughter]—we had bipartisan deals. Bipartisan deals means compromise.
One of the things that I've made clear: I've signed on—and I'm going to let them give you the detail because—and you can ask them—and I'm—I will talk to you all later, in the next hour or two. But I promise you I'm not going away.
But one of the things that we agreed on: infrastructure. We made serious compromises on both ends. There is—and they'll give you the numbers. But we did not—they did not—and I understand their position—Republicans and this group did not want to go along with my—any of my Family Plan issues, the childcare tax credits, the human infrastructure that I talk about.
And that—we'll see what happens in the reconciliation bill and the budget process—if that—if we can get some compromise there. And if we can't, see if I can attract all the Democrats to a position that is there. But we're going to—they're going to move on a dual track. And that's about all I'll say.
But I want to thank each and every one of them. It's been—you know, a lot of us go back a long way, where we're used to doing one thing: Give each other our word, and that's the end. Nobody questions it. They have my word, I'll stick with what they proposed, and they've given me their word as well. So, where I come from, that's good enough for me.
So I'm going to turn it over to the two chairs here. And I'll talk to you all a little bit later.

23-Jun-21,Remarks on Gun Crime Prevention Strategy and an Exchange With Reporters,"Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. Good afternoon, Mr. President. It's good to be here with you and with local elected and community leaders and with representatives of law enforcement.
Protecting our communities from violent crime is a top priority for the Department of Justice and one of our most important responsibilities. I'm glad the President brought us together today to discuss a subject of such importance to the public we serve. As our participants in today's roundtable have noted, the increase in violent crime in 2020 and early 2021 is deeply troubling.
That is why, last month, the Justice Department launched a comprehensive violent crime reduction strategy. This strategy is built around four principles: setting strategic enforcement priorities; fostering trust with and earning legitimacy in our communities; investing in community-based prevention and intervention programs; and measuring the results of these efforts through a decrease in violent crime, not merely by arrests and convictions, as if they were ends in themselves.
Now, we know that the lion's share of violent crime reduction work is shouldered by our State, local, Tribal, and Territorial law enforcement partners. Core to our strategy is targeted support of the critical work that you will be doing in the weeks and months ahead.
Every one of our U.S. attorney's offices is working with its local partners to establish an immediate plan to address the spike in violent crime that typically occurs during the summer. And the law enforcement components of the Department are making enhanced resources available to help prevent and disrupt violent crime and to focus on the most dangerous, most violent offenders.
The Department is also strengthening our Project Safe Neighborhoods, our cornerstone initiative that brings together law enforcement and community stakeholders to develop solutions to pressing violent crime problems.
Community-led efforts are vital to preventing violence before it occurs. The Justice Department has available over $1 billion in funding through over a dozen grant programs that can be used to support evidence-based, community violence intervention strategies.
And I want to say that's what I found particularly useful in our discussion just a few minutes ago, was the fact that there are such evidence-based programs available. And I'm hoping that you will get together with us so that we can spread those across the country, as well, of course, funding your own.
A properly functioning criminal justice system is essential to our efforts as well. The Department has grant funding available to help cities resume court operations and services that were curtailed during the COVID-19 pandemic. That includes funding for technology and equipment for courts to address the backlog of cases and enhance access to justice.
We know that an effective violent crime reduction strategy must also address the illegal trafficking of firearms and focus on keeping guns out of the wrong hands. And so the Department is delivering on the promises we made here at the White House in April.
On May 7, we issued a proposed rule to help address the proliferation of ghost guns. On June 7, we issued a proposed rule to clarify that pistols equipped with certain stabilizing braces are subject to the same statutory restrictions as easily concealable, short-barreled rifles. And on the same day, the Department published model Extreme Risk Protection Order legislation for States to consider as they craft their own laws to reduce gun violence.
We are now taking further steps. First, we will hold gun dealers that break the rules accountable for their actions. Most federally licensed firearms dealers operate legally in selling guns to individuals who have passed background checks. But those dealers that willfully violate the law increase the risk that guns will fall into the wrong hands.
Absent extraordinary circumstances, ATF will initiate proceedings to revoke the licenses of dealers that willfully violate the law by failing to conduct required background checks, falsifying records, failing to respond to trace requests, refusing to permit ATF to conduct inspections, or transferring firearms to persons who are prohibited from owning them.
Second, we are seeking funding to increase ATF's dealer inspection capacity and improve its effectiveness. ATF has very limited inspection resources. The President's fiscal 2022 budget requests resources to add inspection positions in every field division. The effectiveness of the enforcement program depends on the ability to identify and focus on those dealers that pose the greatest risk to public safety. Starting today, ATF will make clear to investigators in every field division that, as they prioritize inspections, they must consider the extent to which firearms sold by a dealer are later used in criminal activity.
Third, we will improve information sharing with State, local, Tribal, and Territorial partners to help bring more intelligence and law enforcement resources to bear, as well as with the public, to increase our own accountability.
Today, ATF has a point of contact in every field division to receive information from mayors, police chiefs, and other local leaders about firearms dealers they believe are acting unlawfully. And starting next month, ATA—ATF will begin sharing inspection data with the 16 States that license or regulate firearms dealers themselves. Also beginning next month, ATF will publicly post information about inspection frequency and outcomes disaggregated by field division, providing for enhanced transparency and accountability.
Fourth, we are launching a concerted effort to crack down on gun traffickers. Yesterday the Department announced that it will establish five new cross-jurisdictional law enforcement strike forces within the next 30 days. The strike forces will focus on addressing significant firearms trafficking corridors that fuel violence in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Washington, DC, as well as in cities and towns along the way.
The Justice Department's violent crime reduction strategy and our initiatives to stem the rising tide of illegal guns will save lives. But these steps alone will not solve the problem of violent crime. Success depends on all of us joining together: those of you in this room, the many like you across the country who are working to keep their communities safe, and the people of our communities themselves.
I would now like to introduce President Biden, who has emphasized the importance of this issue and who has my gratitude for gathering us together today.
Thank you.
The President. Thank you, General. Let me—before I begin, thank the participants in our roundtable today: two mayors—three mayors, chiefs of police, attorneys general, and community organizers who have been doing significant work in bringing down violent crime in their communities. There is no one answer that fits everything. And it's about being engaged and multiple organizations being engaged.
So I want to thank you for the time you spent with us today. And I warned you: I'm coming back at you again for more information. [Laughter]
And we just met, as a I said, with a bipartisan group of mayors, law enforcement, and community leaders. And we discussed a comprehensive strategy that I'm releasing today to combat the epidemic of gun violence and other violent crime that we've been seeing in our country for far too long, that has spiked since the start of the pandemic over a year ago.
Crime has—historically rises during the summer. And as we emerge from this pandemic with the country opening back up again, the traditional summer's—summer spike may even be more pronounced than it usually would be.
For folks at home, here's what you need to know: I've been at this a long time, and there are things we know that work that reduce gun violence and violent crime and things that we don't know about. But things we know about: Background checks for purchasing a firearm are important; a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines—no one needs to have a weapon that can fire over 30, 40, 50, even up to 100 rounds unless you think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests or something; community policing and programs that keep neighborhoods safe and keep folks out of trouble.
These efforts work. They save lives. But over time, these policies were gutted and are woefully underfunded. In our conversation today, we talked about our strategy to supercharge what works while we continue to push the Congress to act on sensible gun violence legislation.
First, we discussed cracking down, as you heard from the Attorney General, on rogue gun dealers. We know that if there is a strict enforcement of background checks, then fewer guns get into the hands of criminals. Background checks have thus far kept more than 3 million guns out of the hands of felons—convicted felons, fugitives, domestic abusers, and others prohibited from being able to purchase a gun. And there are still too many loopholes in that system.
And today, enough rogue gun dealers feel like they can get away with selling guns to people who aren't legally allowed to own them. And I might add: The Second Amendment, from the day it was passed, limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own. You couldn't buy a cannon.
Those who say the blood of—""the blood of patriots,"" you know, and all the stuff about how we're going to have to move against the Government. Well, the tree of liberty is not watered with the blood of patriots. What's happened is that there have never been—if you wanted or if you think you need to have weapons to take on the Government, you need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons. The point is that there has always been the ability to limit—rationally limit—the type of weapon that can be owned and who can own it.
The last time we had data on this issue of who is purchasing guns was more than 20 years ago. Five percent of gun dealers—it turns out, in the study we did—showed that 90 percent of illegal guns were found at the crime scenes sold by 5 percent of gun dealers. Five percent sold 90 percent of the guns found at crime scenes.
And the—these merchants of death are breaking the law for profit. They're selling guns that are killing innocent people. It's wrong. It's unacceptable. And as the Attorney General said, we're going to crack down on those gun dealers and the violent criminals they knowingly arm.
In April, I announced that the Justice Department is going to be issuing an annual report on gun trafficking so we can update that data. Today the Department is announcing, as I just did, a major crackdown on—to stem the flow of guns used to commit violent crimes. It's zero tolerance for gun dealers who willfully violate key existing laws and regulations. Let me repeat: zero tolerance.
If you willfully sell a gun to someone who is prohibited from possessing it, if you willfully fail to run a background check, if you willfully falsify a record, if you willfully fail to cooperate with the tracing requests or inspections, my message to you is this: We'll find you, and we will seek your license to sell guns. We'll make sure you can't sell death and mayhem on our streets. It's an outrage. It has to end, and we'll end it. Period.
Second, we discussed disrupting illegal gun trafficking. Now, the gun lobby wants you to believe that cities that are the toughest gun—have the toughest gun laws still have the highest rates of gun violence, as was pointed out by the group we had today in our roundtable. They—the violence is so—they argue, ""Why do you need those gun laws if they don't work in cities that have tough laws?"" Don't believe it.
Here's the truth: Today's conversation with Mayor Scott of Baltimore, for example, echoed what we know to be the case, and you hear it from mayors across the country. Mayors have the power to help shape and enforce the laws in their cities, but they can't control the laws in neighboring cities and States, even though the gun legally bought there is—often ends up in their streets. Mayor Scott says that 80 percent of the guns in Baltimore were acquired outside the city—outside the city. There's little he can do about that, so we have to act.
As part of our strategy, the Justice Department is creating five new strike forces to crack down on illegal gun trafficking in the corridors supplying weapons to cities like New York; Chicago; Los Angeles; Washington, DC; and the Bay Area. With these strike forces, local and Federal law enforcement and prosecutors are going to be able to better coordinate the prosecution of illegal gun trafficking across city and State lines, so illegal guns sold from the back door of a gun shop in Virginia don't end up at a murder scene in Baltimore. And if they do, then local and Federal law enforcement can better coordinate to trace illegal gun sales back to the shady gun dealer and hold them accountable.
Police Chief Murray of the Baltimore—excuse me, Police Chief Merritt—Police Chief Murphy Paul of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, talked about how he's coordinating more closely with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the ATF, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FBI, to help take on criminal organizations committing violent crimes in the city. This kind of coordination is essential to keeping the weapons of war out of the hands of dangerous criminals, fugitives, and gangs, as well as organized crime.
Third, we discussed historic funding—the—we discussed historic funding for States, cities, and counties, and Tribes for law enforcement and crime prevention. You know, they've not only had to fight this pandemic, they've also had to deal with economic crisis that has decimated their budgets, forced them to cut essential services, including law enforcement and social services.
And amid the COVID-19 pandemic, they've had to deal with a second public health crisis: gun violence. The American Rescue Plan, which we passed in the first hundred days of my administration, is providing much-needed, historic relief to bring back those law enforcement jobs and social service jobs.
Much of this relief has already arrived. The rest is on its way. And we're now providing more guidance on how they can use the $350 billion nationally that the American Rescue Plan has available to help reduce crime and address the root causes. For example, cities experiencing an increase in gun violence were able to use the American Rescue Plan dollars to hire police officers needed for community policing and to pay their overtime.
Mayors will also be able to buy crime-fighting technologies, like gunshot detection systems, to better see and stop gun violence in their communities. They can use the funding to scale up wraparound services for the residents as well, including substance abuse and mental health services that we know will make a difference to prevention of crime.
Here's another example that reminds me of the old saying my mom used to use. She'd say, ""An idle mind is the devil's workshop."" Well, school's out for the summer. Teenagers are in tough neighborhoods, no—who are in tough neighborhoods—no jobs, more trouble.
We know summer job training—summer jobs, training, and recreation for young people work. They help make sure young people pick up a paycheck instead of a pistol. One study found a Boston summer jobs program for youth reduction reduced violent crimes by 35 percent in Boston. Another study found that a program that offers high school students in Chicago a good summer job and an adult mentor and behavioral therapy led to a 45-percent drop in violence.
We can invest in more of these programs with the American Rescue Plan. And here's another thing States, cities, counties, and Tribes can do with that funding: When someone finishes their time in prison, they can't just give them—we can't just continue to give them 25 bucks and a bus ticket. They end up right back where they started and got them in trouble in the first place—or no option for being able to provide for access to public housing or for schools or for mentors to help them find their way and the stuff that prevents recidivism and helps them integrate in a society. That's changing with guidance we're issuing today.
The American Rescue Plan funding can help formerly incarcerated people get skills training, apprenticeships, and work experience so they can gain stability and security and a chance for a better life, rather than going back to exactly what they left.
Attorney General Grewal of New Jersey and Mayor Daniel—and Mayor Daniella Levine Cava of Miami-Dade talked about their efforts to lift up those kinds of—their—the kinds of community programs that reduce gun violence, keep communities safe, and make real, positive difference in people's lives.
And for folks at home, the American Rescue Plan, which is a once-in-a-generation investment to reduce violence in America, is available. I'm proud of it. It means more police officers, more nurses, more counselors, more social workers, more community violence interrupters to help resolve issues before they escalate into crimes.
It means we go after the people who flood our streets with guns and the bad actors who decide to use them to further terrorize the communities. It means saving lives. And Congress should in no way take away this funding. It's already been appropriated.
In fact, a few weeks ago, the bipartisan United States Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, National Association of Counties—they all came out forcefully against efforts to reclaim American Rescue Plan funds that have already been allocated to the States, cities, and counties, and Tribes. This is not a time to turn our backs on law enforcement or our communities.
Fourth, we discussed the need to support community violence intervention. These are local programs that utilize trusted messengers and community members and leaders to work directly with people who are most likely to commit gun crimes or become victims of gun crimes.
We know who they are. They intervene before it's too late, these interrupters: turn down the temperature, halt the cycle of retaliation, connect people to social services. And it works. Community violence intervention programs have shown a reduction in violence of up to 60 percent in many places.
We heard from two community leaders that do this work. Eddie, thank you for coming from Chicago to—you're really—quite frankly, it was impressive—your presentation. And DeVone Boggan from Richmond, California.
Eddie was formerly incarcerated for gun homicide, and DeVone lost his brother to gun violence. And Eddie worked as a violence interrupter. Now he runs a program that provides high-risk men with cognitive behavioral therapy to help them react to the impulses by slowing down rather than following through on the violence. It puts them in—he puts them in paid jobs to change their trajectory. The program has reduced shootings by 40 percent.
DeVone runs a program across California and six other States that enroll high-risk individuals in peace fellowships, complete with intensive mentoring and social services. It's saving lives. In Sacramento, for example, 91 percent of participants stayed away from gun violence.
States and cities should invest the American Rescue Plan funds in those kinds of anti-violent crime programs. And today I'm announcing that the White House will be working with 15 jurisdictions that are doing exactly that—from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, and Memphis to Minneapolis—to build up their community violence intervention programs, starting this summer.
And Mayor Steve Allender of Rapid City, South Dakota—a Republican and a former chief of police himself—joined us today and will be a part of this effort to help disrupt cycles of crime and violence in his community and nearby Tribal communities. We need more mayors to follow, and I'm going to be pushing to keep—pushing for more of these proven programs, which are part of the American Jobs Plan and my budget.
Fifth, and I'll close with this: We talked about the lives we lost—have already been lost and the lives that we can save. We talked about how much pain and loss so many people have experienced and so many people have now accepted as their fate here in America.
We have an opportunity to come together now—as Democrats and Republicans, as fellow Americans—to fulfill the first responsibility of government and our democracy: to keep each other safe. Enough. That means Congress passing sensible gun prevention, violence prevention initiatives is—makes sense: background checks, ban on assault weapons, repeal of the liability shield for gun manufacturers.
It means the Senate reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act—my proudest legislative accomplishment—to close the so-called ""boyfriend loophole""—its ""boyfriend and stalking loophole""—to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. We added the provision saying, ""If you have a stay-away order—you are stalking someone, and you're told it has to stop—you can't own a weapon."" Every single month, an average of 57 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner. We can help stop that.
It means confirming my outstanding nominee for—to lead the AFT—excuse me, the ATF: David Chipman. It's been without a leader for a while. The top job has been unconfirmed for much too long. A career and distinguished ATF official for 25 years, David is eminently qualified for the job that we desperately need to fill.
As Vice President, I pushed hard to lift the freeze on gun violence research at the C—the Center for Disease Control, the CDC. Guess what? Why should they not be able to study gun violence and what causes it? But there's been a block on it. I want to unfreeze that. As President, my budget doubles funding for the gun violence research at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health—the NIH—to study gun violence as a public health threat that it is.
And while we keep pushing there, Vice President Harris and I also—and our entire administration are continuing to be—will continue taking action where we can. Let's stop the proliferation of ghost guns, as we announced back in April with the Attorney General.
We need to support the development of smart gun technologies. This doesn't affect responsible gun owners or Second Amendment rights. It helps keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them in the first place, from a child who accidentally picks up a—picks it up, to a burglar or a violent criminal trying to steal it and use it.
And we need to keep building on the gun violence and crime-prevention strategy we're laying out today. Folks, this shouldn't be a red or blue issue, it's an American issue. We're not changing the Constitution; we're enforcing it, being reasonable. We're taking on the bad actors doing bad and dangerous things to our communities and to our country.
Talk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They'll tell you there's no possible justification for having a hundred rounds in a magazine of a gun. Like I've said before: What do you think, the deer are wearing Kevlar vests? Responsible gun owners will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun but shouldn't be able to buy a gun.
And these kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, including gun owners. The bottom line is this: Let's show the world and show ourselves that democracy works and that we can come together as one Nation. We can do this and save lives.
So thank you, God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
And again, I thank you all for participating. But the bad news for you all is, I'm coming back. I need your continued help. So thank you very, very much.
And, General, thank you. Appreciate it.
Q. Mr. President——
Gun Control Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, are you still holding out hope that Congress can pass another assault weapons ban?
The President. I never give up hope.
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. How do you feel about the bipartisan infrastructure deal that's been released?
The President. I'll tell you that when I get the final numbers tonight.
Gun Violence Prevention Efforts/Social Services in Vulnerable Communities 
Q. Mr. President, what do you feel is the most effective thing that government can do to change the mindset of those who feel compelled to pull the triggers of these guns?
The President. By being engaged in a whole range of programs. We talked today—everything from mental health programs to engaging people early on and letting them know there is other options. Making sure that when a child is young, they have access to a real education, and they get started off on the right foot.
Making sure that when someone gets out of prison, they're not denied public housing, they don't have to go back under the bridge where they were living before; that they're able to get help for health care, et cetera, and reengaging them in the neighborhood, giving them some hope, some opportunity. And in the meantime, making sure that those folks who are taking advantage of them by taking advantage of their situation are, in fact, held accountable.
Thank you all so much.
Voting Rights Legislation 
Q. Once you take care of the voting rights bill, do you think it's time to reform the filibuster?
The President. I think it's time to pass the voting rights bill. [Laughter]","NOTE: The President spoke at approximately 5:05 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the White House.

23-Jun-21,Remarks at the Funeral Ceremony for Former Senator John W. Warner III,"Reverend Hollerith; distinguished clergy; Members of the Congress and our military; distinguished guests, Jeanne, Virginia, John, Mary, and Andrew, and the Warner family: It's a great honor to be invited to speak a few moments about John.
A few days after John's passing, I visited Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day—a sacred place on a solemn day when we undertake the fundamental act of remembrance. And amid the moments that I was there and the monuments of stone, we remember each marker represented a precious life. We remember the heroes of the greatest generation the world has ever known and that bears a noble name—the United States of America—the only nation founded on an idea that we're all created equal, ""endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable Rights,"" including, ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness""; and a democracy that is the very soul of our Nation and that must be defended at all costs, a soul embodied by all those patriots buried in Arlington and the fields across the world and by our dear friend, John Warner.
Like many here, I had the privilege of serving with John for three decades in the United States Senate. While we represented different political parties, I can say without hesitation John was a man of conscience, character, and honor, with a deep commitment to God and country.
Enlisted in the Navy—in the United States Navy at age 17 to fight in World War II. A few years later, enlisted in the Marine Corps to fight in Korea. Eventually named Secretary of the Navy by President Nixon, then elected to the United States Senate, where he became a towering and respected voice on foreign policy, national security, and defense; the second longest serving Senator from Virginia and the longest serving Republican.
A member of the Greatest Generation, and as that, he understood that democracy is more than a form of government; democracy is a way of being. He understood it begins and grows in an open heart and with the willingness to work across the aisle and come together in common cause.
And that empathy—empathy—is the fuel of democracy, the willingness to see each other as opponents, not as enemies. Above all, to see each other as fellow Americans even when we disagree. From John's perspective, especially when we disagreed. That's how John forged consensus and made sure our system worked and delivered for the people. I saw it time and again on issues of war and peace. John opposing torture and ending gun violence; on protecting the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.
John's decisions were always guided by his values, by his convictions, and never by personal political consequences. And he was always guided by his obligation to all those he represented, even those who did not vote for him.
Every Senator wears the pride of his or her State on their sleeve, but John's love for the people of Virginia was something special. And they loved him back and kept reelecting him because they knew John understood the job of Senator was bigger than himself. It was about more than just John.
And as we say in the Senate, ""Excuse me a point of personal privilege"": When John endorsed me for President last year, it carried an extra meaning for me. The Senators and Congresspersons here will understand this. It wasn't merely that a prominent Republican endorsed me; when John endorsed me, it gave me confidence, not about winning, about being able to do the job. John gave me confidence.
You know, in the battle for the soul of America today, John Warner is a reminder of what we can do when we come together as one Nation. While we've never made real the full promise of America to all Americans, John's life is a reminder that every generation—every generation—has opened the door of opportunity a little bit wider. Every one.
And the mission handed down generation to generation is the work of perfecting the Union, a mission he now leaves us with a way forward. That's the power of remembrance. It lies not just in our history, but in our hope for the future. Not just in our solace, but in our strength. It lies in our hearts to continue the work of democracy—the work of our time, of all time, and the work of John's whole life.
To John's Senate staff: Thank you for your service and for all you'll do to carry on John's legacy. And to his family—Jeanne, Virginia, John, Mary, Andrew—Jill [and]* I know it hurts to remember. Sometimes, it just hurts to remember. But it's also the way to heal, to remember.
The Bible teaches, ""Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted."" While comfort can be a long time in coming, I promise you it will come. It will give you purpose in his memory, in his love for you, in his love for this country.
Virginia, I know you'll be reciting your father's favorite poem, a sort of an anthem. Here's another one that describes him so well, in my view, that means a great deal to my family and to me. It's called ""American Anthem"":
The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day,
What shall be our legacy? What will our children say?
Let me know in my heart when my days are through,
America, America, I gave my best to you.
John Warner gave his best to America and, to the best of my knowledge, to everybody he had a relationship with. May God bless him. He was a good man, a great American. It was an honor to have known him and worked with him.","NOTE: The President spoke at 11:21 a.m. at the Washington National Cathedral. In his remarks, he referred to Rev. Randolph M.

22-Jun-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne B. Criswell and Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall,"The President. Well, our FEMA Director—Administrator is here today. We're going to talk about was the severe weather patterns we're facing which keeps—likely to increase every year. And I want to make sure that we're in a position to be able to help Americans all across the country and in all our jurisdictions as these severe weather incidents increase.
The last few days alone, we've seen droughts and wildfires in the West, and we've seen tornadoes in Illinois, flooding in the South and the Mid-Atlantic. And extreme weather doesn't confine itself, as you all know, to State lines. These crises require proactive Federal response. It's just not just the States responding.
And I know that your team, Administrator, is going to raise—be faced with a lot of challenges this year, more than most. And not that you're not used to it, but it's going to—this time, it's the whole country.
And we've already stepped up this year to help vaccinate the American people and respond to the—and—but now we have to respond to these brutal storms and more severe storms and fires that extend into longer seasons throughout the year. And we're going to bring every resource to bear to be prepared, to respond, and to help people recover, but it's a big job.
And we're making sure FEMA and other frontline agencies have what they need to continue getting the job done. And I insist on being ready for whatever comes our way. That's what this is all about. And that's what we're here today about. And I'll be hosting a meeting next week with Western Governors and FEMA and the Cabinet members to prepare for heat, drought, and wildfires in the West.
And so I want to thank everybody for being here today. And let me just say one other thing. You know, I was talking with my staff a moment ago in the office about wildfires. And you know, the thing I know a little bit about is the fire service. And there's an old expression: God made man, and then he made a few firefighters. They are—they have the higher incidence of severe injuries than police officers do. They are incredibly, incredibly brave, what they do: They run to the fire.
And I just realized—I didn't realize this, I have to admit—that Federal firefighters get paid $13 an hour. That's going to end in my administration. That's a ridiculously low salary to pay Federal firefighters. Not that many Federal firefighters, but—and they—and I know you use all the resources, including State and local firefighters.
But, any rate, that's we're going to talk about today. And we're going to be brought up to date on what we can expect this season. And many of you have covered what's already happened. And the drought in the West is just astounding, when you take a look at it. Fires have already started and flooding.
So we're in for a tough season, but I think we've got to be prepared and have every resource available to make sure we're there for the American people.
Thank you all so very much.

18-Jun-21,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon.
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
Excuse me. I'm pleased to announce that today we will have reached the mark of 300 million shots in the arms in just 150 days. Let me say that again: 300 million shots in arms in under 150 days.
Now, it's an important milestone that just didn't happen on its own or by chance. It took the ingenuity of American scientists, the full capacity of American companies, and a whole-of-Government response across Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments. Together, we built an unparalleled vaccination program and managed one of the biggest and most complicated logistical challenges in American history. And above all, we got here because of the American people stepping up and getting vaccinated—helping family, friends, neighbors get vaccinated.
And just remember what the situation was like 150 days ago. We didn't have enough vaccine supply for all Americans. We didn't have the vaccine infrastructure or the people to administer the vaccines or the places where the people could get vaccinated. But we turned it around together by acting quickly and aggressively and equitably.
We secured enough vaccine supply for every American. And as I announced last week during my visit to Europe, we are now in a position to provide more than one-half billion vaccine doses to the rest of the world, the hundred poorest nations.
We've developed and deployed over 9,000 Federal personnel, including 5,100 Active Duty military, to support the vaccine effort and to get shots into arms. And now we have more than 81,000 vaccination sites across the country, including over 42,000 local pharmacies.
Thanks to this wartime response, we've gotten 300 million shots in the arms of Americans in 150 days, months ahead of what most anyone thought was possible when we started. In fact, if you remember, a lot of people were skeptical that we could even get 100 million shots in my first 100 days into people's arms. But we did it. We kept going. And what we're seeing is a truly American accomplishment.
Sixty-five percent—65 percent—of American adults have gotten at least one shot, including 87 percent of our seniors. Just 5 months ago, we were at only 5 percent of adult Americans. Fifteen States and the District of Columbia have now reached at least 70 percent vaccination rate in their State. Twenty-six States and DC have fully vaccinated——
[The President cleared his throat.]
——excuse me—50 percent or more of the adults. Nationwide, we have the lowest number of daily deaths since the first days of the pandemic.
And we've built equity into the heart of our vaccination program from day one. Seventy-three percent of the shots administered at community health centers through the Federal program and more than 58 percent of the shots administered by federally run vaccination sites have gone to people of color. And across the Nation, people of color have accounted for more than half of all vaccinations in the last month. That's important progress, but we have much more to do.
Vice President Harris is, as I speak—is in Atlanta, getting the word out about the vaccinations. Yesterday I signed a bill——
[The President cleared his throat.]
——excuse me—into law making Juneteenth a Federal holiday. And this weekend, folks in communities across the country are going to be canvassing and hosting events to encourage their families, friends, and neighbors to get vaccinated. The more we close the racial gap in vaccination rates, the more lives we'll save.
And as our vaccination program is saying—saving tens of thousands of lives, with that count growing each day, it's also allowing millions of Americans to get back to living their lives: grandparents hugging their kids; kids back to school and getting ready for the summer; people going out to restaurants and traveling; businesses are reopening. Folks, we're heading into a very different summer compared to last year. A bright summer. Prayerfully, a summer of joy.
But as I promised you from the beginning, I will always give it to you straight: the good, the bad, and the truth. And the truth is that deaths and hospitalizations are drastically down in places where people are getting vaccinated. But unfortunately, cases and hospitalizations are not going down in many places in the lower vaccination-rate States. They're actually going up in some places.
A few days ago, we crossed 600,000—600,000—Americans dead from COVID, more than every death in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and 9/11 combined. So even while we're making incredible progress, it remains a serious and deadly threat.
And the data is clear: If you are unvaccinated, you're at risk of getting seriously ill or dying or spreading it. People getting seriously ill and being hospitalized due to COVID-19 are those who have not been fully vaccinated. The new variant will leave unvaccinated people even more vulnerable than they are a month ago—over a month ago.
This is a serious concern, especially because of what experts are calling the ""Delta"" virus—the ""Delta"" variant. It's a variant that is more easily transmissible, potentially deadlier, and particularly dangerous for young people. But the good news is, we have the solution. The science and the data are clear: The best way to protect yourself against these variants are to get fully vaccinated.
So, please, please, if you have one shot, get the second shot as soon as you can so you're fully vaccinated. And if you haven't gotten vaccinated yet, get vaccinated now. Now. Don't put it off. It's free. It's easy. It's convenient.
And as I said many times, text your ZIP Code to the numbers 438829—438829—to find the sites where you can get vaccinated closest to you. Get your free Uber or Lyft ride to and from vaccination sites. I want to thank Uber and Lyft for their cooperation.
Use the extended hours at thousands of pharmacies in June, including thousands that are open 24/7 on Friday this month. Most pharmacies now offer walk-in vaccinations. No appointment is needed. Employers with less than 500 employees: The Federal Government is providing you a tax credit to give your workers paid time off to get vaccinated and recover if they need be.
And for anyone who still questions, that's okay—you still have questions. But act—act now. Act now. Talk to your family and friends who've gotten the—gotten vaccinated. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist. According to the American Medical Association, over 90 percent of physicians are fully vaccinated. They're making the choice to protect themselves and their communities and their patients. Follow their lead and make the choice for yourself.
As I said, we're heading into, God willing, the summer of joy, a summer of freedom. On July 4, we're going to celebrate our independence from the virus as we celebrate our independence of our Nation. We want everyone—everyone—to be able to do that.
Let's remember, we are the United States of America. Let's get this done, all of us, together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on Catholic bishops?
Q. [Inaudible]
Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on the Catholic bishops?
Delta Coronavirus Variant 
Q. Could the Delta variant force us back into lockdown?
The President. I don't think so, because so many people have already been vaccinated, but with—the Delta variant can cause more people to die in areas where people have not been vaccinated. Where people have gotten the two shots, the Delta variant is highly unlikely to result in anything, other than—I mean, as—the existing vaccines are very effective.
So no, it's not a lockdown, but some areas will be very hurt.
U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops 
Q. Sir, any comment about—[inaudible]—what the Catholic Bishops have done? Are you concerned about this rift within the Catholic Church? And are you concerned about this action?
The President. Say again?
Q. The Catholic Bishops are moving on this resolution that would prevent you and others who have supported abortion from receiving communion. Are you concerned about the rift in the Catholic Church? And how do you feel personally about that?
The President. That's a private matter, and I don't think that's going to happen. Thank you.

17-Jun-21,Remarks on Signing the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act,"The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Well, thank you, Madam Vice President.
One hundred and fifty-six years ago—156 years—June 19, 1865—John, thanks for being here—a major general of the Union Army arrived in Galveston, Texas, to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation and free the last enslaved Americans in Texas from bondage. A day, as you all know—I'm going to repeat some of what was said—that became known as Juneteenth. You all know that. A day that reflects what the Psalm tell us: ""Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.""
Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation and a promise of a brighter morning to come. This is a day of profound—in my view—profound weight and profound power, a day in which we remember the moral stain, the terrible toll that slavery took on the country and continues to take, what I've long called ""America's original sin.""
At the same time, I also remember the extraordinary capacity to heal and to hope and to emerge from the most painful moments and a bitter, bitter version of ourselves, but to make a better version of ourselves.
And today we consecrate Juneteenth for what it ought to be, what it must be: a national holiday. As the Vice President noted, a holiday that will join the others of our national celebrations: our independence, our laborers who built this Nation, our service men and women who served and died in its defense. And the first new national holiday since the creation of Martin Luther King holiday nearly four decades ago.
I am grateful to the Members of Congress here today, in particular, the Congressional Black Caucus, who did so much to make this day possible. I'm especially pleased that we showed the Nation that we can come together as Democrats and Republicans to commemorate this day with the overwhelming bipartisan support of the Congress. I hope this is the beginning of a change in the way we deal with one another.
And we're blessed—we're blessed—to mark the day in the presence of Ms. Opal Lee. As my mother would say, ""God love her."" You know, I had the honor of meeting her in Nevada more than a year ago. She told me she loved me, and I believed it. [Laughter] I wanted to believe it. [Laughter] Ms. Opal, you're incredible. A daughter of Texas, grandmother of the movement to make Juneteenth a Federal holiday.
And Ms. Opal is—you won't believe it—she's 49 years old. [Laughter] Or 94 years old, but I—[laughter]. You are an incredible woman, Ms. Opal. You really are.
As a child growing up in Texas, she and her family would celebrate Juneteenth. On Juneteenth, 1939, when she was 12 years old, the White—a White mob torched her family home. But such hate never stopped her any more than it stopped the vast majority of you I'm looking at from this podium.
Over the course of decades, she's made it her mission to see that this day came. It was almost a singular mission. She's walked for miles and miles, literally and figuratively, to bring attention to Juneteenth, to make this day possible. I ask, once again, we all stand and give her a warm welcome to the White House.
As they still say in the Senate and I said for 36 years, ""if you excuse me there for a point of personal privilege,"" as I was walking down, I regret that my grandchildren aren't here because this is a really, really, really important moment in our history.
By making Juneteenth a Federal holiday, all Americans can feel the power of this day, and learn from our history, and celebrate progress, and grapple with the distance we've come, but the distance we have to travel, Jim.
You know, I said a few weeks ago, marking the hundredth anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre, great nations don't ignore their most painful moments. Great nations don't ignore their most painful moments. They don't ignore those moments of the past. They embrace them. Great nations don't walk away. We come to terms with the mistakes we made. And in remembering those moments, we begin to heal and grow stronger.
The truth is, it's not—simply not enough just to commemorate Juneteenth. After all, the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans didn't mark the end of America's work to deliver on the promise of equality, it only marked the beginning. To honor the true meaning of Juneteenth, we have to continue toward that promise because we've not gotten there yet. The Vice President and I and our entire administration and all of you in this room are committed to doing just that.
That's why we've launched an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing—finally address the cruel fact that a home owned, to this day, by a Black American family is usually appraised at a lower rate for a similar home owned by a White family in a similar area. That's why we committed to increasing Black homeownership, one of the biggest drivers of generational wealth.
That's why we're making it possible for more Black entrepreneurs to access capital—because their ideas are as good; they lack the capital to get their fair—and get their fair share of Federal contracts so they can begin to build wealth.
That's why we're working to give each and every child, 3 and 4 years of age, not daycare, but school—in a school. That's why we're unlocking the incredibly creative and innovation—innovation of the history—of our Historical Black Colleges and Universities, providing them with the resources to invest in research centers and laboratories to help HBCU graduates prepare and compete for good-paying jobs in the industries of the future.
Folks, the promise of equality is not going to be fulfilled until we become real—it becomes real in our schools and on our main streets and in our neighborhoods—our health care system and ensuring that equity is at the heart of our fight against the pandemic; in the water that comes out of our faucets and the air that we breathe in our communities; in our justice system—so that we can fulfill the promise of America for all people. All of our people.
And it's not going to be fulfilled so long as the sacred right to vote remains under attack. We see this assault from restrictive laws, threats of intimidation, voter purges, and more—an assault that offends the very democracy—our very democracy.
We can't rest until the promise of equality is fulfilled for every one of us in every corner of this Nation. That, to me, is the meaning of Juneteenth. That's what it's about. So let's make this Juneteenth—this very Juneteenth, tomorrow—the first that our Nation will celebrate all together, as one Nation—a Juneteenth of action on many fronts.
One of those is vaccinations. Tomorrow the Vice President will be in Atlanta on a bus tour, helping to spread the word, like all of you have been doing, on lifesaving vaccines. And across the country this weekend, including here in Washington, people will be canvassing and hosting events in their communities, going door to door, encouraging vaccinations.
We've built equity into the heart of the vaccination program from day one, but we still have more work to do to close the racial gap in vaccination rates. The more we can do that, the more we can save lives.
Today also marks the sixth anniversary of the tragic deaths of—at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina. A killer motivated by hate, intending to start a race war in South Carolina, he joined his victims in a Bible study class; then, he took their lives in the house of worship. It's a reminder that our work to root out hate never ends, because hate only hides, it never fully goes away. It hides. And when you breathe oxygen under that rock, it comes out.
And that's why we must understand that Juneteenth represents not only the commemoration of the end of slavery in America more than 150 years ago, but the ongoing work to have to bring true equity and racial justice into American society, which we can do. In short, this day doesn't just celebrate the past; it calls for action today.
I wish all Americans a happy Juneteenth. I am shortly going to—in a moment, going to sign into law, making it a Federal holiday. And I have to say to you, I've only been President for several months, but I think this will go down, for me, as one of the greatest honors I will have had as President, not because I did it; you did it—Democrats and Republicans. But it's an enormous, enormous honor.
Thank you for what you've done. And by the way, typical of most of us in Congress and the Senate, I went down to the other end of the hall first and thanked your staffs because I know who does the hard work. [Laughter] No, they're down there. They're at the other end, but I thanked them as well.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Now, I'd like to invite up, while I sign, Senator Tina Smith, Senator Ed Markey, Senator Raphael Warnock, Senator John Cornyn, Whip John [Jim]* Clyburn, Representative Barbara Lee, Representative Danny Davis, Chair Joyce Beatty, and Sheila Jackson Lee, and Ms. Opal.

Anyway, thanks for being here. And most of you've been here the whole route. I really do think—not me, but I think we, the country, has put a different face on where we've been and where we're going. And I feel good about it. I feel—you know, one of things that I think, understandably, there was a good deal of skepticism about: would the G-7 sign on and give America back its, sort of, leadership role. I think it did. It wasn't me, but it meant they're glad America is back. They're glad America is back, and they acted that way.
And then, when we went to NATO, I think it was the same thing. We had really good meetings there and real response, as well as the EU. I didn't get one single person—not one of the world leaders—said to us anything other than thanking me for arranging a meeting with Putin. And I thought, quite frankly, I was in a much better position to represent the west, after the previous three meetings with Putin, that—knowing that the rest of the west was behind us.

Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, since you're now heading home, can I just ask you briefly about two domestic issues?
The President. I'm not sure I can answer them, but——
Q. If you could. First would be this fate of the infrastructure bill. There's now a bipartisan group that has a new offer. Have you had time to review it?
The President. I haven't seen it.
Q. Okay.
The President. No, I'm not being—I honestly haven't seen it. I don't know what the details are. I know that my Chief of Staff thinks there's some room that there may be a means by which to get this done. And I know that Schumer and Nancy have moved forward on a reconciliation provision as well. So I'm still hoping we could put together the two bookends here.
Q. The Iran nuclear deal——
Senate Minority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell 
Q. And the second issue is: Yesterday—or earlier this week, Mitch McConnell said that if Republicans were to take back the Senate in 2022, he did not see a way that you could get a Supreme Court Justice confirmed. Do you have a response to that?
The President. Uh——
Q. So this would be next year.
The President. No, I know. I know. The answer is: Mitch is—Mitch has been nothing but ""no"" for a long time. And I'm sure he means exactly what he says, but we'll see.
Iran/International Diplomatic Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, did you talk with President Putin about the Iran nuclear deal?
The President. Yes.
Q. Did you make—find a way? What did you discuss, and did you find a way to make some progress?
The President. It was about how we would jointly work, and I'm not going to discuss what we discussed.
The President's Approach to Diplomacy 
Q. Mr. President, Kaitlan's [Kaitlan Collins, CNN] question that you answered at the very end there, that you came over to talk about, I think at the heart of it was this question of whether or not you seem overly optimistic, given that—what we all listened to President Putin essentially say the same, old things that he's said forever. He—you know, rejecting all responsibility for all that stuff.
And I guess the question that she was trying to get, and maybe you could take another stab at it, is: What concrete evidence do you have from these 3 or 3-plus hours that suggest that any movement has been made?
And I don't know—I don't mean that to be—I'm not—it's not meant to be a——
The President. No, no, no. No. I know, but you're all——
Q. ——""gotcha"" question. I——
The President. Look, to be a good reporter, you've got to be negative. You've got to have a negative view of life—okay?—it seems to me, the way you all—you never ask a positive question.
Why, in fact, having agreement—we'll find out. We have an agreement to work on a major arms control agreement. I started on working on arms control agreements back all the way during the cold war. If we could do one when the cold war, why couldn't we do one now? We'll see. We will see whether or not it happens.
But what do you—I mean, the thing that always amazes me about the questions—and I apologize for having been short on this before. If you were in my position, would you say, ""Well, I don't think, man, anything is going to happen. This is going to be really rough. I think it's going to really be bad""? You guarantee nothing happens. You guarantee nothing happens.
And so, so far——
Q. So there's a value to——
The President. There's a value to being realistic and put on an optimistic front, an optimistic face.
Look, you all said the same thing about the, you know, what was going to happen when we had the first meeting of the Seven. ""Oh, Biden—they're not going to—they're not going to buy Biden's stuff. They're really not really""—any of you find that? Did that happen? Any of it? A little bit? Just a little sliver of it?
When I went to meet with NATO—""Oh, boy, they're not going to be happy. They're all going to be against Biden meeting with Putin. They're not going to want that."" Did you hear a single, solitary syllable?
Now, what would have happened if I had said, before I went into those negotiations: ""You know, I think it's going to be really hard. I think it's going to be really difficult. I'm not so optimistic about it. I don't see anybody really changing""?
And the same way when I met with the EU. ""The EU is not going to like the way Biden is operating.""
Q. But this is Vladimir Putin. I mean, can you be optimistic about his change?
The President. Sure, it's Vladimir Putin. But look, it was also—I don't want to compare him to Putin, but it was—the French President said he will never go for more money for NATO. Guess what? He's agreed.
Every—I mean, look, guys, I'm going to drive you all crazy—[laughter]—because I know you want me to always put a negative thrust on things, particularly in public, and negotiate in public.
I don't have to trust somebody—we didn't have to trust somebody to get START II. It wasn't about our trust—""Well, I trust the Russians. I can tell, man, they're really—they're—I can look in his eye, and they're really very, very truthful."" It's not that at all.
You have to figure out what the other guy's self-interest is. Their self-interest. I don't trust anybody—look, I've got to get in the plane, but I'll say it—you'll hear me say this more than once.
Q. It's your plane. You can go when you want. [Laughter]
The President. Yes, no, but—no, but here's the thing: Folks, I don't see any benefit ever to begin a negotiation as—and, I mean, you're the brightest people in the country. You're the most informed people on detail. I'm not being solicitous; you are. But it makes no sense for me to negotiate with you. It makes no sense for me to tell you what I'm about to do. It makes—not because I want to hide anything from you. Why would I telegraph that?
Russia/U.S. Leadership in Multilateral Affairs/Status of Democracy in the World 
Q. Did he do anything that surprised you, sir?
White House staffer. Sir, we need to go. Sir, we really have to go.
Q. Was there any moment that you were really surprised by?
White House staffer. Sir—thank you, guys. Thank you, guys.
The President. No, I wasn't surprised because I was convinced that—let me choose my words. Russia is in a very, very difficult spot right now. They are being squeezed by China. They want desperately to remain a major power. You all are writing about, not illegitimately, ""Biden already gave Putin what he wants: legitimacy, standing in the world stage with the President of the United States."" They desperately want to have—be relevant.
They have—and they don't want to be known as, as some critics have pointed and said, you know, the ""Upper Volta with nuclear weapons."" It matters. And I found it matters to almost every world leader—no matter where they're from—how they're perceived, their standing in the world. It matters to them. It matters to them in terms of their support at home as well.
And so I think that there is—I'm trying to think how to shorten this so I can get in the plane. [Laughter] I'm of the view that, in the last 3 to 5 years, the world has reached a fundamental inflection point about what it's going to look like 10 years from now. I mean it literally. It's not hyperbole. It's not like I'm trying to pump it up. I think it's a genuine reality.
And so each of the countries in—around the world, particularly those who had real power at one time or still do, are wondering: What—how do I maintain and sustain our leadership in the world? That's what the United States is going through right now. How do we sustain us being the leading, most powerful, and most democratic country in the world? A lot is going on.
I don't know about you, I never anticipated, notwithstanding no matter how persuasive President Trump was, that we'd have people attacking and breaking down the doors of the United States Capitol. I didn't think that would happen. I didn't think we'd—I'd see that in my lifetime. But it's reinforced what I've always known and what I got taught by my political science professors and by the senior members of the Senate that I admired when I got there: that every generation has to reestablish the basis of its fight for democracy. I mean, for real, literally have to do it.
And I've never seen, including during—since the Civil War, such an outward assault on voting rights. I mean, just a flat assault. I didn't anticipate that happening 4 years ago, but it's happening now.
So there's a lot at stake. Each of the countries, we have our own concerns and problems, but we still—as long as I'm President, we are going to stick to the notion that we're open, accountable, and transparent. And I think that's an important message to send the world.
Thank you all so much.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.

15-Jun-21,"Remarks at the U.S.-European Union Summit Plenary Session in Brussels, Belgium","Well, thank you. Thank you both very much. It's been one of the great pleasures getting to know you both, you know, personally and just in terms of our official positions. And we were at the G-7, and again today—I apologize I kept my colleagues in the closed meeting.
But I want to—you know, this is—I haven't been back to Brussels and the EU since 2017, and since the—back then, also the first summit back in 2014. Anyway, but I brought the A-team with me today. And you know, I've said, both publicly and privately, that America is back, and this is why we're here in full force.
I'm happy to have with me today the members of my Cabinet: Secretary of State Antony Blinken—he suffers from the problem of having worked with me for years—and also Trade Representative, Ambassador Katherine Tai, who has made some real progress already; and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, who was a first-rate Governor and one of the brightest people that we've worked with and agreed to come on as our Secretary of Commerce.
And one of the things that you and I were talking about— and will come as no shock to either of you: Europe is our natural partner, and the reason is, we're committed to the same democratic norms and institutions and are—and they are increasingly under attack.
And we—I've said before, and I apologize for repeating—oh, I didn't mention Jake Sullivan—[inaudible]—who is my National Security Adviser. I'm leaving out a lot of people here. I apologize. I'm going to get in trouble. But anyway, we'll get back to that in a minute.
But we—you know, there's a lot that is happening. I used to always—my friends would kid me in the United States Senate, because I served there, for always quoting Irish poets. You think I quoted Irish poets because I'm Irish. That's not the reason. I quote them because they're the best poets in the world; that's why. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, there is a stanza from a poem from an Irish poet, who we just lost. He said: ""All is changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty has been born."" I think all has changed in the last 10, 12 years, and it's not because of any one person.
I think we're in the midst of terrible beauty having been born—a great shift in technology, a great shift in the development of the world—and it's causing great anxiety in each our countries and uncertainty among many of our colleagues of what's going to be their place in the world. Are they going to be replaced by a new technology? Are they going to no longer have a job? And what are they going to do?
And that comes along at the same time that that also generates—when uncertainty is generated politically like that, by individuals, it also generates some folks who are less than—how can I say it?—some of them are like charlatans, trying to take advantage of those concerns. And we see it in Europe. We see it in the United States. We've seen it around the world. And it's phony populism.
So it seems to me that the best answer to deal with these changes is that—to have a circumstance where our economies grow and they grow together and they grow still based on the value set that united us in the first place. And I think we do share just the same basic values of human dignity and human rights as I've—my colleagues have.
I'll be very colloquial with you: My dad had a transition where, in the city we lived in, coal was dying; it was no longer relevant. You know, he was not a—my great-grandfather was a coal miner; he was a mining engineer. But when—in northeastern Pennsylvania, when coal died, my dad was a salesperson, and the economy collapsed. And we moved to another part where there were jobs, in southern—into—down in Delaware, a very—just across the Pennsylvania border.
And my family—my siblings and I would hear him often use the following expression. He said: ""Joe, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about being able to look at your child in the eye and say 'Honey, it's going to be okay' and mean it."" I think we sometimes forget that. It's about the dignity of the worker and them being able to hold their head high.
And so I think we have an enormous opportunity, if we think in terms of these changes—particularly in terms of global warming—if we think of them in terms of jobs. The kind of jobs that we're going to have to create to preserve the environment are jobs that can pay well, that are going to be—use technologies that working class, blue-collar workers, as we say in the States, will be able to make more money, be able to do well. And—but we have to, all of us, accommodate those changes and provide for them.
And so I think we have a lot to deal with, from COVID-19 to whether or not we're in a position that we can generate the kind of strengthening transatlantic trade and technological cooperation. They're, sort of, a different set of priorities with the same objective: How do likeminded countries, sharing the same values, work together to improve the living standard for not only our people, but for the rest of the world? And I think we have the capacity to do that, and it's going to take an awful lot of hard work and determination.
And I'll conclude by saying: One of the reasons I'm optimistic is because of our younger generation, in Europe as well as the United States. The young generation—this one—is the best educated in American history. It is also the least prejudiced, the most open, and the most committed.
And I think that we have reason to believe that if we provide the policies that are consistent, that provide for the kind of growth and opportunity for them—and education plays a gigantic part of that—I think we—I think the future is very, very bright. I think we have an opportunity to do some, really, very good things.
And with that, I should—as my mother would say, I should ""hush up"" and let this discussion move forward.","NOTE: The President spoke at 1:13 p.m. in the Europa Building.

Mr. President, it is great to see you again and just a week after we met in the White House. And thank you so much for your strong personal commitment and powerful leadership on the transatlantic bond on what to do together, North America and Europe.
We meet at a pivotal time for our alliance.
President Biden. Absolutely.
Secretary General Stoltenberg. We will open a new chapter in our transatlantic relationship with the meeting today; address a wide range of issues, including Russia. And I think that the allied leaders look forward to consulting with you ahead of the meeting with President Putin.
We will address China, and we have seen the convergence of views among allies. We all recognize that China's heavy investments in military capabilities, continued coercive behavior, and their growing influence matters for our security. And we need to respond to that together as an alliance.
We will review the NATO 2030 agenda, an ambitious agenda for the future of NATO. And to do all this, we need to invest more. And that's exactly what we're doing with 7 consecutive years of increased defense spending: 260 billion extra U.S. dollars across Europe and Canada.
So a stronger NATO is good for Europe, but is also good for America.
President Biden. It's very good for America, essential for America.
Secretary General Stoltenberg. And I know that no other major power has as many friends and allies as United States has in NATO. So I know that we can count on America and that America can count on Europe.
So welcome, Mr. President.
President Biden. Well, thank you. And thank you for your incredible leadership over the years. I really mean this: You have been incredible. I—quite frankly, we have competent people coming, but I wish you were not leaving, because—and, no, I really mean it—you have been absolutely incredible, and you've been strong. You've been able to pull people together.
And I think that there is a growing recognition over the last couple of years that we have new challenges. And we have Russia that is not acting in a way that is consistent with what we had hoped and—as well as China.
And I must say that we had, as preliminary to this, a number of my colleagues and our colleagues who are in the G-7 have stepped up as well, in terms of the need for there to be greater coordination than we even have now.
But I want to make it clear: NATO is critically important for U.S. interests in and of itself. If there weren't one, we'd have to invent one. It is—it allows America to conduct its business around the world in a way that never would have occurred were it not for NATO, number one.
Number two, you know, I believe—and I've said this my whole career and the 4 years I was out, when I decided to run for President again—that NATO is—article 5, we take as a sacred obligation. And I constantly remind Americans that when America was attacked for the first time on its shores since what happened back in the beginning of World War II, NATO stepped up. NATO stepped up, and they honored article 5. And I just want all of Europe to know that the United States is there. The United States is there.
And we are pleased, back in Wales, the decision was made to increase spending. You're right, and it's moving up. I guess there's more than 10 countries that have met the goal, and others are on the way.
And so it's important, but it's—I just want to thank you for your leadership. A lot of this wouldn't happen without you.

10-Jun-21,"Remarks on the Global COVID-19 Response and Vaccination Efforts in St. Ives, United Kingdom","The President. Good evening, everyone.
First, I want to express our condolences on behalf of Jill and I to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, the entire royal family, and the people of the United Kingdom. Today would have been Prince Philip's 100th birthday, and I know there are a lot of people feeling his absence today.
In addition, I'd like to point out that the greet from the British Government has been exemplary. We've had a good first full day here in the U.K. Prime Minister Johnson and I had a very productive meeting. We discharged and discussed a broad range of issues on which the United Kingdom and the United States are working in very close cooperation.
We affirmed the special relationship—and it's not said lightly—the special relationship between our people, and we renewed our commitment to defending the enduring democratic values that both our nations share——
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
——that are the strong—excuse me—the strong foundation of our partnership.
Eighty years ago, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin Roosevelt signed an agreement known as the Atlantic Charter. It was a statement of first principles, a promise that the United Kingdom and the United States would meet the challenges of their age and they would meet it together.
Today we built on that commitment with a revitalized Atlantic Charter updated to reaffirm that promise while speaking directly to the key challenges of this century: cybersecurity, emerging technologies, global health, and climate change.
We discussed our common goals for driving ambitious global action to address the climate crisis. The Climate Leaders' Summit that I hosted in April was, in part, about helping drive forward the momentum toward the critical COP 26 that the U.K. will host in Glasgow later this year.
We talked about the shared sacrifices our servicemembers have made, bravely serving side by side in Afghanistan for close to 20 years. The U.K. was with us from the start, as they always are, equally committed to rooting out the terrorist threat, and now we're coordinating our withdrawal together.
And of course, we talked about how our two nations can, together, lead the global fight against COVID-19. That's been a major focus of the G-7 under British leadership, particularly in focusing and coordinating our resources to help vaccinate the world.
And tonight I'm making a historic announcement regarding America's leadership in the fight against COVID-19. America knows firsthand the tragedies of this pandemic. We've had more people die in the United States than anywhere in the world, nearly 600,000 of our fellow Americans: moms, dads, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, grandparents. More deaths from COVID-19 in the United States than from World War I, World War II, the Vietnam war, and 9/11 combined—combined. We know the tragedy.
But we also know the path to recovery. The United States has now vaccinated 64 percent of our adults with at least one shot. Just 4½ months ago, we were at only 5 percent with one shot. It took a herculean effort on the part of our Government to manage one of the biggest and, I would say, most complicated logistical challenges in our history. It took the ingenuity of scientists, building on decades of research, to develop a vaccine. It took the full capacity of American companies manufacturing and delivering the vaccines around the clock.
And as a result, we have the lowest number of daily deaths since the first day of this pandemic. Our economy is rebounding. Our vaccination program has already saved tens of thousands of lives, with that count growing each day. And it has allowed millions—millions—of Americans to get back to living their lives.
From the beginning of my Presidency, we have been clear-eyed that we need to attack this virus globally as well. This is about our responsibility—our humanitarian obligation to save as many lives as we can—and our responsibility to our values. We value the inherent dignity of all people. In times of trouble, Americans reach out to offer help, to offer a helping hand. That's who we are.
And when we see people hurting and suffering anywhere around the world, we seek to help as best we can. That's why, under both Republican and Democratic Presidents, the United States has made transformative commitments to bolster global health, commitments under President Bush, like PEPFAR, which changed the global fight against HIV/AIDS. And in this moment, our values call on us to do everything that we can to vaccinate the world against COVID-19.
It's also in America's self-interest. As long as the virus rages elsewhere, there is a risk of new mutations that could threaten our people. We know that raging COVID-19 in other countries holds back global growth, raises instability, and weakens governments. And as we've seen in the United States, with the evidence clearer day by the day, the key to reopening and growing economies is to vaccinate your people.
Our vaccination program has helped the American economy begin to recover from the worst economic crisis in a century: over 2 million new jobs created just in the last 4 months since I've become President; an historic decline in long-term unemployment; businesses reopening and a projected economic growth of nine-point—excuse me, 6.9 percent, the fastest in nearly four decades in America.
Just as the American economy is recovering, it is in all of our interests to have the global economy begin to recover as well. And that won't happen unless we can get this pandemic under control worldwide. That's why, as I said in my address to the joint session of Congress in April, America will be the arsenal of vaccines in our fight against COVID-19, just as America was the arsenal of democracy during World War II.
Over the past 4 months, we have taken a number of steps toward this historic effort. We have contributed more than any nation to COVAX, a collective global effort that is delivering COVID-19 vaccines across the world. We have supported manufacturing efforts abroad through our partnerships with Japan, India, and Australia, known as the Quad. We've shared doses with our neighbors Canada and Mexico.
And in addition, 3 weeks ago, with America's vaccines—America's vaccine supply secured and with confidence we have enough vaccines to cover every American who wants one, we announced that we would donate 80 million doses of our own vaccine—in house now—to supply the world by the end of June. Many of these doses are shipping to countries around the world as we speak.
And today we're taking a major step that will supercharge the global fight against this pandemic. At my direction, the United States will purchase an additional half billion doses from Pfizer—the Pfizer vaccine—that we'll donate nearly 100 low- and lower-middle-income countries. They will be the beneficiaries.
Let me say that again: The United States will purchase a half a billion doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to donate to nearly 100 nations that are in dire need in the fight against this pandemic. That's a historic step, the largest single purchase and donation of COVID-19 vaccines by any single country ever.
Importantly, this is an mRNA vaccine, which is proven to be extremely effective against COVID-19 and every known variant of that virus thus far.
These half a billion vaccines will start to be shipped in August as quickly as they roll off the manufacturing line. Two hundred million of these doses will be delivered this year, 2021, and 300 million more will be delivered in the first half of 2022.
Let me be clear: Just as with the 80 million doses we previously announced, the United States is providing these half-million [billion]* doses with no strings attached. Let me say it again: with no strings attached. Our vaccine donations don't include pressure for favors or potential concessions. We're doing this to save lives, to end this pandemic. That's it. Period.
I also want thank Albert Bourla, Pfizer's CEO and chairman, for joining me today. We've gotten to know each other over the last few months. He and I and his entire team have really—he's really stepped up at this critical stage in our fight against the pandemic.
And the plan is for a half a billion doses that we'll be sending around the world to be produced in the United States, including at Pfizer's manufacturing plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Eighty years ago, not too far from that plant in Kalamazoo, in the Detroit area, American workers built tanks and planes and vehicles that helped defeat the global threat of fascism in World War II. They built what became known as the ""arsenal of democracy.""
Now, a new generation of American men and women, working with the day's—working with today's latest technology, is going to build a new arsenal to defeat the current enemy of world peace, health, and stability: COVID-19. Albert was gracious enough to welcome me to Kalamazoo plant back in February. It's incredible the ingenuity, the care, the safety that goes into every single dose as I toured the entire plant.
Most of all, when you're there, you feel the pride that every worker there feels, how—the pride they feel in what they are doing. I've been to a lot of plants. I have worked—I'm a big union guy. I've been doing it my whole career. But you could see the looks on their faces; they were proud. I mean it sincerely, they were proud of what they were doing. They knew what they were doing.
American workers will now produce vaccines to save lives of people in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean: people they will never meet and have never met, places they've never visited and probably won't have an opportunity to, but lives saved all the same thanks to American leadership and American workers' hard work and values.
Let me close with this: This is a monumental commitment by the American people. As I said, we're a nation full of people who step up at times of need to help our fellow human beings, both at home and abroad. We're not perfect, but we step up.
But we're not alone in this endeavor, that's the point I want to make. We're going to help lead the world out of this pandemic, working alongside our global partners. Under the U.K. chairmanship of the G-7, democracies of the world are posed to deliver as well. This U.S. contribution is the foundation for additional coordinated efforts to help vaccine the world—vaccinate the world. The British Government, the Prime Minister, has led a strong campaign to get people vaccinated across the U.K., and I'm grateful they're making their own generous donation.
Tomorrow the G-7 nations will be announcing the full scope of our commitment, ""our"" meaning the G-7. And I want to thank all of my G-7 partners for stepping up to recognize our responsibility to meet the moment. I'm looking forward to working with my counterparts on these efforts in the coming days and much more.
One final point I want to make clear: This is not the end of our efforts to fight COVID-19 or vaccinate the world. We have to turn manufacturing—we have to turn manufactured doses into shots in arms to protect people and communities.
That's why the United States is already providing hundreds of millions in funding to support last-minute vaccination efforts, including new funding from Congress as part of the American Rescue Plan and working with programs in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. We're going to keep manufacturing doses, donating doses, getting ""jabs""—as they say here in the U.K.—in arms, until the world has beaten this virus.
I want to thank you all. Now, I'd like to turn it over to my friend, the CEO and chairman of Pfizer, Albert Bourla. Albert, it's all yours. And, again, personally, thank you for stepping up.
Pfizer Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you.
Mr. Bourla. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. President. And it is, of course, a great honor to be with you today for this historic announcement.
As the G-7 countries come together for this critical summit, the eyes of the world are on the leaders of these powerful nations to help solve the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. While great progress has been made in many developed nations, the world is now asking the G-7 leaders to shoulder the responsibility to help vaccinate people in all countries.
Mr. President, I know from our conversations that we agree that every man, woman, and child on the planet, regardless of financial condition, race, religion, or geography deserve access to lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines. And once again, the United States has answered the call, and we are grateful to you and your administration for your leadership in this front.
Today we are providing 500 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to the world's poorest nations. This will significantly enhance our ability to meet our goal of providing 2 billion doses of the vaccine to low- and middle-income countries over the next 18 months.
Thanks to the ingenuity of so many scientists and the dedication of so many manufacturing workers, today we can see clearly the light at the end of the tunnel. But we still have work to do. And I can assure you, Mr. President, that we will be relentless in pursuing more services to end the pandemic.
Just this week, we began dosing participants aged 5 to 11 years old in a global Phase 2/3 study. In this respect, we continue our studies in pregnant women. We are also closely monitoring and addressing the emerging variants, we are testing our vaccine's response to newly arising variants, and we are coordinating with public health authorities around the world on surveillance efforts. So far, data saw that none of the existing variant strains has escaped the protection provided by our vaccine. I repeat: none. Not one.
Still, we have built a process to develop, within 100 days, a new vaccine if needed, God forbid. Our scientists are also pursuing an oral treatment against COVID-19. Initial indications are promising. And if things goes well, we could apply for approval before the end of this year.
But I wanted to finish my—by coming back to the importance of your announcement today, Mr. President. In a pandemic, everyone is only as protected as their neighbors: their neighbors down the street, as well as their global neighbors around the world.
Today's announcement with the U.S. Government gets us closer to our goal and significantly enhances our ability to save even more lives across the globe. Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leadership, vision, and partnership. We look forward to continue to work with your administration to ensure that science wins the battle against COVID-19.
Thank you.
The President. Thank you.
Mr. Bourla. Thank you.
The President. Thank you all.","NOTE: The President spoke at 6:28 p.m. at the Tregenna Castle Resort.

9-Jun-21,"Remarks to United States Servicemembers at Royal Air Force Mildenhall in Suffolk, United Kingdom","Hello, Mildenhall!
Colonel, thank you for that introduction and your service leading this team in such a difficult time. Because we know that it's the whole family who serves, I also want to thank Melissa. I know—I know your next assignment at U.S. Transportation Command starts soon. So congratulations, and thank you, thank you, thank you.
And, Sydney, you're 14 years old. When I was 14, if you—please, at ease. [Laughter] I keep forgetting I'm President. [Laughter] When I was 14 years old, I would have been—I mean this sincerely—scared to death to stand up in front of a microphone, in a large crowd or small crowd. See, when I was a child, I used to stutter badly, for real. I had great difficulty speaking in front of other people. And so I expect that when you're President, you'll remember me. [Laughter] You'll remember me. You're, really, quite a polished young woman. Thank you.
And you know, it's got to be hard to have your dad deployed in Afghanistan. And I also know how proud you are of him and your mom, Chief Master Sergeant, for being part of the leadership team here.
Our son Beau served as a U.S. attorney for a while in Kosovo for a while. Matter of fact, they erected a war monument to him. And then, he went on, and he joined the National Guard. Gave up his job as attorney general of the State of Delaware so he can go with his unit to Iraq for a year. And when he got promoted to major, I said, ""Beau, you're now a field-grade officer."" I was in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan about 28 times. And I said, ""You're now a field-grade officer."" He said: ""Dad, I have no illusions. I know who runs the military: chief master sergeants."" [Laughter] So I just want you to know we know. Okay?
Thank you for your incredible dedication and service. And you know, I want to thank you all—all of you, all your families—for the sacrifices they've made. And congratulations to having just a wonderful child.
There's an awful lot of history at this base, a proud history for the British people: the bravery and heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots fighting to defend their nation. I'm sure everyone here knows the history, but just 6 hours after Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939, three Wellington bombers took off from Mildenhall and bombed Nazi battleships.
And over the course of World War II, out of this base, your RAF bombers dropped nearly 28,000 tons of bombs on Nazi Germany, flying more than 8,000 sorties. This base has been a significant source of British air power, a proud, proud history of a proud nation.
But I also know there's also an awful lot of American Air Force pride in this room tonight. World War II was when the U.S. Army Air Force formed the 100th Bombardment Group.
And by the way, my—just so you know—although my uncle, who was killed in World War II in New Guinea was Army—he was the Army Air Corps. He got shot down in a reconnaissance flight. And he would—he's looking down and thinking, ""All these years, my God, what this Air Force has become."" It's incredible.
The 100th also ran more than 8,000 sorties into hostile territory and supported operations from D-day to the Battle of the Bulge, where another uncle of mine served. And when they first arrived in the U.K. in '43, the unit took such heavy losses, it earned the moniker that has been passed down to this day: ""The Bloody Hundredth."" The Bloody Hundredth. So let me hear it for the 100th Air Wing—Air Refueling Wing, a.k.a.—known as the ""The Bloody Hundredth."" [Applause] And what about the 352nd Special Operations Wing? [Applause] There's Team Reconnaissance. Members of the Air Mobility Command.
Do we have any folks from the 48th Fighter Wing, over from RAF—by the way, look how—[applause]. I think maybe. The 501st Combat Support Wing from RAF Alconbury. [Applause] And this may be a historic first for an Air Force base, but I hear there just might be a few members of the United States Army here tonight with us. [Applause] Come on, man.
To all of you airmen and soldiers, I want to just say thank you. We owe you. We're so damn proud of you. So proud. And I only wish my major was here to thank you as well. Thank you—everything you do, for everything that you are.
There's nothing that Jill and I enjoy more than spending time with our troops and their families, wherever we go in the world. I had the great honor of being in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq well over 27, 28 times. I think Jill is the only Second Lady in American history who has gone into a war zone, into Baghdad with me as well.
You're the best—you're the best—of our country. That's not hyperbole. You're the ones who sign up and run toward danger when duty calls. Less than 1 percent of Americans make the choice that you make—that you made. But the rest of us—the other 99 percent of us—we owe you. We owe you big.
I've long said that, as a nation, we have many obligations, but we only have one truly sacred obligation—only one—and that's to properly prepare and equip the women and men we send into harm's way and to care for you and your families, both while you're deployed and when you come home. And now that I have the incredible honor of serving as your Commander in Chief, I believe that even more strongly. You know—and I want to give an extra special thank you to all the families.
As you heard from Jill, we Bidens are a proud military family, and we know there's not just the person who wears the uniform who serves; the whole family has to step up, the whole family makes sacrifices. There's a famous Irish poet who said, ""They also serve who only stand and wait.""
I watched all those months Beau was in Kosovo. And then, I watched all those—that year he was in Iraq. She would stand at that sink, leaving for school, drinking her coffee, and I could see her lips moving, saying that prayer, hoping that car never drove up in front of the house, hoping you never got that phone call.
And that's even more true this past year during the lockdowns and safety precautions to curb the spread of COVID-19. Everyone in this room knows that our military families are essential—essential—to our strength.
It's the key reason Jill relaunched Joining Forces: to make sure we're doing everything we can to support our military spouses and children and their mothers and fathers as well, just like they support all of you.
You know, you not only did an amazing job keeping COVID-19 under control on the base, you took care of each other and your mental health throughout the initiatives like your Spouse-to-Spouse Connection and your Wellness Advocacy Team. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. As you all know, this is a team sport.
And my mother would kill me if she were here. She'd say, ""Joey, you shouldn't have""—I should have turned around and apologized for by back to you. I apologize. [Laughter] I haven't figured out how to turn in 360 yet. [Laughter]
But, folks, thousands of hours spent volunteering to make sure everyone got through this. It was so important. I know that these last 15 months added a lot of new pressure, but all of you rose to the task together as one team, Team Mildenhall. And you never let up on your mission.
And I'm so proud to be here with all of you to kick off my first overseas trip as President. I've been in and out of here many, many times. I've visited well over a hundred countries as President or as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee—or I meant as Vice President or chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. This is my first overseas trip as President of the United States.
I'm heading to the G-7, then to the NATO Ministerial, and then to meet with Mr. Putin to let him know what I want him to know. [Laughter] And, at every point along the way, we're going to make it clear that the United States is back and democracies of the world are standing together to tackle the toughest challenges and the issues that matter most to our future; that we're committed to leading with strength, defending our values, and delivering for our people.
America is better positioned to advance our national security and our economic prosperity when we bring together like-minded nations to stand with us. These nations that have shed blood alongside of us in defense of our shared values. Our unrivaled network of alliances and partnerships that are the key to American advantage in the world and have been. They've made the world safer for all of us, and they are how we are going to meet the challenges of today, which are changing rapidly. We're going to meet it, though, from a position of strength.
Our alliances weren't built by coercion or maintained by threats. They're grounded on democratic ideals, a shared vision of the future, and where every voice matters—where the rights of all people are protected. It's the same reason so many of you signed up to serve, to proudly defend and honor the democratic values that are the wellspring of our national strength.
If our British friends will excuse me quoting the Declaration of Independence—[laughter]—America is unique in all the world in that we are not formed based on geography or ethnicity or religion, but on an idea—an idea. The only nation in the world founded on the notion of an idea: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men""—and women—""are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,"" including ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" We mean it. No nation can defeat us, as long as we stick to our values.
It's our American creed. It's what makes us who we are. And it's what draws friends and partners to our side. And for hundreds of years, American patriots have fought, and sometimes died, defending those values.
Folks, look, I'm often quoted by the press as saying, ""America leads not by the example of its power, but by the power of our example."" All of you—our servicemembers stationed around the world—you are the solid steel spine of America around which alliances are built and strengthened year after year.
These partnerships have hardened and have been hardened in the fire of war, and generations of Americans and servicemembers who fought them, like the original Bloody Hundredth and those RFA [RAF]* pilots, and their shared mission in World War II: flying, fighting, winning. It was done together.
These bonds of history and shared sacrifice run deep and are strong, based on values. And they endure. The connections and camaraderie between our troops, this community of American citizens stationed in the U.K.—U.S. visiting forces and families, 20,000 strong—are not only warriors, you're diplomats, and you're bridge builders. You are the essential part of what makes up this ""special relationship"" between Great Britain and the United States.
Over the next few days, as I said, I'll be participating in meetings with many of our closest partners at the G-7 in Cornwall, and then on to Brussels and NATO summit—of the EU—and the EU summit. This diplomacy is essential, because no single nation acting alone can meet all the challenges we face today, because the world is changing. To quote another Irish poet, he said: ""The world's changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born.""
We're in a different place than we were 10 years ago, a better position, but a different place. We have to build the shared future we seek: a future where nations are free from coercion or dominance by more powerful states; where the global commons—the seas, the air, the space—and space—remain open and accessible for the benefit of all.
To tackle this century's most pressing challenges, we have to do it together. We have to end COVID-19, not just at home—which we're doing—but everywhere. There's no wall high enough to keep us safe from this pandemic or the next biological threat we face—and there will be others.
That requires coordinated, multilateral action. We must all commit to an ambitious climate action if we're going to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, and lead the global transition to clean energy technology.
You know, when I went over in the Tank in the Pentagon, when I first was elected Vice President, with President Obama, the military sat us down to let us know what the greatest threats facing America were—the greatest physical threats. And this is not a joke: You know what the Joint Chiefs told us the greatest threat facing America was? Global warming. Because there'll be significant population movements, fights over land, millions of people leaving places because they're literally sinking below the sea in Indonesia; because of the fights over what is arable land anymore.
With the G-7, we've planned to launch an ambitious effort to support resilience and development around the world by investing in high-quality, high-standard physical, digital, and health infrastructures.
We have to make sure that new technologies and norms of conduct in cyberspace are established, including addressing the growing threat of ransomware attacks, that are governed by our democratic values, not by the autocrats who are letting it happen. These are all critical national security issues in 2021, and we're going to be driving this agenda together with our G-7 partners.
In Brussels, I will make it clear that the United States commitment to our NATO alliance and article 5 is rock solid. It's a sacred obligation we have under article 5. The U.S. and the U.K. are both founding members of NATO, the strongest military and political alliance in the history of the world. And that's not hyperbole. Our troops have stood shoulder to shoulder around the world, including serving bravely in the mountains of Afghanistan for the past 20 years.
Our NATO allies have had our backs when it mattered, just like we've had theirs when it's mattered. And now we need to modernize our alliance, investing on our critical infrastructure, our cyber capabilities, and to keep us secure against every threat that we've faced over the last decade and the new challenges we're about to face as well.
With the European Union leaders, I'll discuss how the United States can work with Europe to address the full range of issues that require the full strength of our transatlantic partnership, including working together to shape the new rules for the 21st-century economies.
And only after these meetings with our closest democratic partners to develop a common agenda and renewed purpose, I'll travel to Geneva to sit down with a man I've spent time with before: President Vladimir Putin. We're not seeking conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship. Our two nations share incredible responsibilities and among them ensuring strategic stability and upholding arms control agreements. I take that responsibility seriously.
But I've been clear: The United States will respond in a robust and meaningful way when the Russian Government engages in harmful activities. We've already demonstrated that. I'm going to communicate that there are consequences for violating the sovereignty of democracies in the United States and Europe and elsewhere.
I'm going to be clear that the transatlantic alliance will remain vital, a vital source of strength for the U.K., Europe, and the United States. And I'm going to make sure there's no doubt as to whether the United States will rise in defense of our most deeply held values and our fundamental interest.
Here's why this all matters so much right now: I believe we're at an inflection point in world history, the moment where it falls to us to prove that democracies will not just endure, but they will excel as we rise to seize the enormous opportunities of a new age.
We have to discredit those who believe that the age of democracy is over, as some of our fellow nations believe. We have to expose as false the narrative that decrees of dictators can match the speed and scale of the 21st [century]* challenges.
You know and I know they're wrong. But it doesn't mean we don't have to work harder than ever to prove that democracy can still deliver for our people. For the many who think things are changing so rapidly, democracies cannot get together and form a consensus to respond like autocrats can, but you know better than anyone that democracy doesn't happen by accident. We have to defend it. We have to strengthen it, renew it.
And I know that the American people are up to this job. I know because I look around this hangar and what I see is, I see America. I see America: people of different backgrounds coming together in a share mission. Our democracy has never been perfect. Never been perfect. But Americans of all races, religions, sexual orientation, immigrants, Native Americans all have spilled their blood to defend the values that we talk about.
Generation after generation of American heroes have signed up to be part of the fight because they understand the truth that lives in every American heart: that liberation, opportunity, justice is far more likely to come to pass in a democracy than in the emerging autocracies in the world.
I promise you that's what this is going to be all about for your generation and those of your children. And here's what else I know beyond a doubt: There is not a single thing—nothing—nothing beyond America's competence to accomplish when we do it together, when we do it as one people. You're proof of that. You're proof of that every single day. Your bravery, your decency, your honor, your commitment to duty.
You can send more fuel through a boom of a KC-135R in 8 minutes than a civilian gas pump can pump in 24 hours, and you do it in midair, and it's all a normal day for this team. So don't tell me we can't win our race to the future across the board.
We're the country that cracked the physicals and the physics of human flight, then crashed through the sound barrier, then put a man on the Moon and flew a helicopter on Mars. I could go on and on and on. There is nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity.
So I want to thank you again for welcoming Jill and me today. It's great to be here in the U.K., but it's greater being here and seeing you first. Seeing all of you is the best possible way to start this trip.
Well, let me end where I began: by saying ""thank you."" I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I give you my word. Thank you all for what you do. Thank you all for your understanding that we're a Nation based on values. Thank you all for protecting us all.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, and God bless.","NOTE: The President spoke at 8:45 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to Col. S.

4-Jun-21,"Remarks on the National Economy and an Exchange With Reporters in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware","The President. Hello, folks. Good morning. Today we received great news for our economy and our recovery and for the American people.
This morning we learned that, in May, our economy created 559,000 new jobs, unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent, and wages went up for American workers. That means we have now created over 2 million jobs in total since I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first 4 months of any Presidency in modern history, triple the rate of my predecessor, eight times the rate of President Reagan.
The unemployment rate is now below 6 percent for the first time since the pandemic hit. The first 14 months—first time—first time in 14 months, we saw the largest decline in the number of long-term unemployed, more—in more than an entire decade, in the last 10 years. Long-term unemployment dropped by the second largest amount ever recorded. Not only that, but the signs of further progress are already here.
This report is based on a weekly—a week in early May. That's how we—they determine the job rate—growth or loss; we have growth. And that—and this—that week in May, we only had 35 percent of working-age adults had been fully vaccinated. Now we're still all—they were still all wearing masks.
Since then, 21 million more adults have gotten vaccinated, making it easy for them to return to work safely. In short, this is progress, historic progress. Progress that's pulling our economy out of the worst crisis it's been in 100 years. And it's testament to the new strategy that is growing this economy, not only growing it, but growing it from the bottom up and the middle out.
Remember, when I took office in January, our economy was in a tailspin, job growth had stalled, COVID was raging, average initial claims for unemployment insurance were over 830,000 per week. Now those claims have fallen below 430,000, about half of what they were when I took office.
Before I took office, almost 24 million Americans were going hungry. Remember those long lines of cars, miles long, people waiting for just a box of food to be put in their trunk? That number has already dropped by 25 percent. Still too many, but clear progress.
Before I took office, independent experts were projecting that the American economy would grow by 3 or 4 percent in 2021—this year. This week, the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development—the so-called OECD, which makes up a group that includes the world's largest economies in its membership and has been one of the leading bodies analyzing economic growth worldwide in individual nations—increased their projection for U.S. economic growth this year to 6.9 percent in 2021. That's the fastest pace in nearly four decades.
In fact, the U.S. is the only major economy where projections of future growth are stronger today than they were before the pandemic hit in 2020. And in May, manufacturing activity was nearly as strong as it was in more than 15 years—stronger than in 15 years. No other major economy in the world is growing as fast as ours. No other major economy is gaining jobs as quickly as ours.
And none of this success is an accident; it isn't luck. It's due in no small part, first of all, to the cooperation of the American people in responding to my effort to get COVID under control: wearing masks initially and getting vaccinated. And it's no small part to the bold action we took by passing the American Rescue Plan. The plan provided those resources to get shots in people's arms; underwrite the vaccination effort; enough vaccine supply for every single American; more vaccinators, people to put shots in the arms; and more vaccination sites.
And now 52 percent—52 percent—of American adults are fully vaccinated. 75 percent of our seniors are fully vaccinated. And the American Rescue Plan delivered economic benefits directly to the American people.
Because of that law, more than 167 million of those rescue payments of up to $1,400 have gone out to individual families. A recent study, the Census Bureau data found just how much these checks mattered. They drastically reduced depression—according to the study—anxiety, and hardship for families. More than 40 percent fewer families struggled to afford food, rent, utilities, car payments, student loans, and health care expenses.
Small businesses and restaurants are—were getting killed. Now we're delivering loans and support they need to reopen and to stay open. Schools are struggling to reopen, so we made vaccinating teachers a priority. We delivered schools the much support they needed. State and local governments had to lay off tens of thousands of educators and first responders. Many are now back on the job, thanks to the Rescue Plan.
In fact, in May, State and local governments added 103,000 education jobs, returned them to work. These funds are continuing to get out this month to support State and local governments, which will help get more people back to work.
Small and medium-sized businesses are now able to take advantage of a special tax credit called the Employee Retention Tax Credit. It provides businesses a generous tax credit to retain or hire more workers. Through our Restaurant Revitalization Fund, we anticipate being able to help over 100,000 hard-hit restaurants stay open or reopen.
And beginning next month, most families with children will be getting a tax cut, which will be going into—deposited into their accounts—directly into their bank accounts every month.
We know that access to childcare is one of the biggest barriers in the way of parents going back to work. Our administration is delivering $39 billion in childcare relief to help childcare providers get back on their feet—the providers—and serve more families. And this month, our economy added nearly 20,000 more childcare jobs that weren't there last month—in fact, allowing parents to have access to get help.
And temporary boost in unemployment benefits that ended—that we enacted, I should say—helped people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own, and who still may be in the process of getting vaccinated. But it's going to expire in 90 days. That makes sense it expires in 90 days.
To sum it up: Look, COVID cases are down, COVID deaths are up [down],* unemployment filings are down, hunger is down, and vaccinations are up, jobs are up, wages are up, manufacturing is up, growth is up, people gaining health care coverage is up, and small-business confidence is up.
America is finally on the move again. As we continue this recovery, we're going to hit some bumps along the way. Of course, that will happen. We can't reboot the world's largest economy like flipping on a light switch. There's going to be ups and downs in jobs and economic reports, but we're going to be—supply chain issues and price pressures on the way back to stability and steady growth.
In the coming weeks, my administration is going to take steps to combat these supply constraints, building on the work we're doing on the computer chips; that is, we're providing more computer chips to be manufactured here in the United States so it doesn't slow up the manufacturing of automobiles, for example.
Everyone needs to get their shots though. Now is the time to accelerate the process [progress]* we've been making. Now is the time to build on the foundation we've laid, because while our progress is undeniable, it is not assured.
That's why I proposed the American Jobs Plan and the American Family Plan for generational investments we need today. We need to make those investments today to be able to continue to succeed tomorrow. We have a chance to seize on the economic momentum of the first months of my administration, not just to build back, but to build back better.
This much is already clear: We're on the right track. Our plan is working. And we're not going to let up now. We're going to continue to move on. I'm extremely optimistic. I hope you are as well.
And may God bless you, may God bless America, and may God protect our troops. Thank you all for being here this morning. Thank you.
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. President Biden, do you have—[inaudible]—on the infrastructure talks?
The President. I'm going to be having a talk this afternoon, and I'll be able to report to you after that.
Q. Are you expecting a counteroffer, Mr. President?
The President. I'll tell you after I meet this afternoon.
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci 
Q. Mr. President, do you still have confidence in Dr. Fauci?
[At this point, having already left the room, the President stuck his head back in the doorway and responded to the question as follows.]
The President. Yes, I'm very confident in Dr. Fauci. [Laughter]","NOTE: The President spoke at 10:38 a.m. at the Rehoboth Beach Convention Center. In his remarks, he referred to former President Donald J. Trump.
* White House correction.","Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on the National Economy and an Exchange With Reporters in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/350230 ",,,,,,,,,,,
2-Jun-21,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon. Today the Vice President and I would like to lay out our plan for June, to counter—continue, I should say, our successful fight against the pandemic as we approach the July 4 date.
In just 4 months, thanks to the American people, we have made incredible progress getting people vaccinated quickly, efficiently, and equitably. Nearly 170 million Americans of every party, every background, every walk of life have stepped up, rolled up their sleeves, and gotten the shot.
Fifty-two percent of adults are now fully vaccinated, including seventy-five percent of all seniors. Twenty-eight States and the District of Columbia have achieved 50 percent of adults being fully vaccinated in their jurisdictions. And it's clearer than ever: The more people we get vaccinated, the more success we're going to have in our fight against this virus.
Since January 20—and we're talking, now, about 15 [5]* months ago—the average daily cases are down from 184,000 to 19,000, below 20,000 for the first time since March of 2020. Average hospitalizations are down from 117,000 to 21,000. Death rates are down over 85 percent.
And this didn't just happen by chance. We got to this moment because we took aggressive action from day one with a whole-of-Government response. We used every lever at our disposal to get this done.
We experienced the production and expanded it in a significant way: in lifesaving vaccines available for every single American. They're available, and we knew that was the case months ago.
We worked with cities and States to create over 80,000 vaccination sites. We deployed over 9,000 Federal staff, including 5,100 Active Duty troops to help get shots in arms. Now, as a result, we have built a world-class vaccination program.
I promised you we'd marshal a wartime effort to defeat this virus, and that's just what we're doing. And now, tens of millions of Americans have been vaccinated. They're able to return to closer to a—closer-to-normal life.
Fully vaccinated people are safely shredding [shedding]* their masks and greeting one another with a smile. Grandparents are hugging their grandkids again. Small-business owners are reopening storefronts and restaurants.
Because of the vaccination strategy, our economic strategy, we're—experienced the strongest economic recovery this country has seen in decades. There is a group called the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development—OECD—which includes most of the world's largest economies in its membership. They've been one of those leading bodies analyzing economic growth across—around the world for 60 years.
Just this week, they increased their projection for the U.S. economic growth this year to 6.9 percent—6.9 percent. That's the fastest pace in nearly four decades. And that's because of our vaccination program and our economic response, which, alone, are adding 3 to 4 percentage points to our growth; driving stronger growth not just there—not just this year, but in years to come. In fact, America is the only major country where global forecasters have actually increased their 5-year forecasts for economic growth since January of 2020.
And because of that, America is headed into the summer dramatically different from last year's summer: a summer of freedom, a summer of joy, a summer of get-togethers and celebrations—an all-American summer that this country deserves after a long, long, dark winter that we've all endured.
But what happens after the summer? The data could not be clearer: For all the progress we're making as a country, if you are unvaccinated, you are still at risk of getting seriously ill or dying, or spreading disease to others, especially when Americans spend more time indoors again, closely gathered in the fall, as—and as we face the potential threat of a new, more dangerous variants.
Even now, if you look at the areas of the country where vaccination rates are the highest, the death rates are dramatically falling. They—the vaccines are effective; they're effective against the variants currently circulating in the United States. On the other hand, COVID deaths are unchanged in many parts of our country that are lagging behind in vaccinations.
And for young people who may think this doesn't affect you, listen up, please: This virus, even a mild case, can be with you for months. It will impact on your social life. It could have long-term implications for your health that we don't even know about yet or fully understand yet.
It's true that young people are much less likely to die from COVID. But if you do not get vaccinated, you could get COVID sooner or later. But you could get COVID still. A substantial percentage of people with COVID, even young people, will suffer illnesses, and some will have long-term health impacts as a consequence.
If you're thinking that the side effects from the shot are worse than the COVID or that you can't just take a chance, you are just dead wrong. Do it for yourself. Do it to protect those more vulnerable than you: your friends, you family, your community.
You know, some people have questions about how quickly the vaccines were developed. They say they've been developed so quickly, they can't be that good. Well, here's what you need to know: Vaccines were developed over a decade of research in similar viruses, and they've gone through strict FDA clinical trials.
The bottom line is this—I promise you: They are safe. They are safe. And even more importantly, they're extremely effective. And if you're vaccinated, you are protected. If you are not vaccinated, you are not protected. Places with high vaccination rates will also see fewer cases of COVID moving forward. Places with lower vaccination rates are going to see more.
You know, we were elected to be President and Vice President for all Americans. And I don't want to see the country that is already too divided become divided in a new way, between places where people live free from fear of COVID and places where, when the fall arrives, death and severe illnesses return.
The vaccine is free, it's safe, and it's effective. Getting the vaccine is not a partisan act. The science was done under Democratic and Republican administrations. Matter of fact, the first vaccines were authorized under a Republican President and widely developed by a Democratic President—deployed by a Democratic President.
All over the world, people are desperate to get a shot that every American can get at their neighborhood drug store at no cost, with no wait. Every American over 12 years of age—no matter where you live, what you believe, who you voted for—has the right to get vaccinated. It's your choice. So, please, exercise your freedom, live without fear. We need to be one America, united, free from fear this fall.
Now, how will we keep beating this virus as we enter the fall after summer? On May 4, I asked Americans to come together to get 70 percent of adults with one shot by July 4—70 percent at least with one shot. To date, 12 States have already reached this important milestone. We expect more to make this milestone this week.
Nationally, we are at 63 percent of adults with one shot. And we are getting closer, but we still have work to do. With 73 percent of Americans over the age of 40 with one shot, and as—we especially need people under 40 to step up. Over 40 is doing much better.
That's why today we're announcing a month-long effort to pull all the stops—all the stops—to free ourselves from this virus and get to 70 percent of adult Americans vaccinated. Now, I'm going to take everyone—you know, it's going to take everyone—everyone—the Federal Government; the State governments; local, Tribal, and Territorial governments; the private sector; and most importantly, the American people—to get to the 70-percent mark so we can declare our independence from COVID-19 and free ourselves from the grip it has held over us—our lives for the better part of a year.
Each of you has the power to help us gain this freedom as a nation. If you get a shot this week, you can be fully vaccinated by July 4—by the week of July the 4. And you can celebrate Independence Day free from fear or worry.
This effort has five key parts. First, we're making it easier than ever to get vaccinated. Ninety percent of you live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. The vaccinations are free, and most places allow walkup vaccinations. No appointment needed. You can go to vaccines.gov or text your ZIP Code to 438829 to get a text back with the places you can get a shot that are close by.
And now we're going to make it even easier. In response to our call to action, businesses and organizations across the country have stepped up to help everyone get vaccinated. Starting next week, many vaccination sites will be offering extended hours during the month of June, including pharmacies that will be open 24 hours every Friday night—for 24 hours they'll be open—this month. And if you're too busy at work or school, you can get vaccinated around the clock on any Friday. Any Friday.
For parents who haven't been able to get the shot because they didn't have the childcare: Starting today, KinderCare, Learning Care Group, the Bright Horizons, alongside with hundreds of YMCA locations, are going to offer free drop-in childcare while the parents are getting vaccinated.
In addition, Uber and Lyft are both offering free rides to and from vaccination sites—vaccination centers. It's easier than ever to get vaccinated. So, again, text 438829 to find out what the nearest places you can get vaccinated are from where you— your ZIP Code. And visit pharmacies with an extended-hour and walkup shots that are available. Free childcare, free rides, free shots.
Second, we're going to reduce [redouble]* our outreach and public education efforts. We're going to relaunch them, in effect. We're going to launch a national vaccination tour to encourage people to take the shot. The Vice President is going to lead that tour across the South and the Midwest, where we still have millions of people to vaccinate. She's going to be joined by Jill—by the First Lady and the Second Gentleman and Cabinet Secretaries along the way.
In the spirit of meeting people where they are, we'll also be working with the Black Coalition Against COVID and other organizations to launch a new initiative called ""Shots at the Shop."" Barbershops, beauty shops are hubs of activity and information in Black and Brown communities in particular, but in many communities across the Nation. Local barbers, stylists, they become key advocates for vaccinations in their communities, offering information to customers, booking appointments for them, even using their own businesses as vaccination sites. We're going to work with shops across the country to make an even bigger impact over the next month.
We'll also kick things off this weekend with a National Canvassing Weekend, where thousands of volunteers will be out knocking on doors and encourage their communities to get vaccinated. And mayors—mayors—will be stepping up even more over the next month and partnering with us on the City Vaccination Challenge to see which city can grow its vaccination rate the fastest—the most—by July 4. We need you to join these efforts. This is the kind of on-the-ground work that's going to get the job done.
Third, we'll be increasing our work with employers—employers. A lot of working people are holding back because they're concerned about losing pay if they take time off to get a shot or if they don't feel well the next day. I've said before: For small- and medium-sized employers, if you give people paid time off to get a shot, you'll get a tax credit to cover that cost.
Already, millions of workers across the country are eligible for paid time off and incentives from their employers. I'm asking all employers: Do the right thing. And we're making it easy for employers to set up on-the-job vaccination clinics to make it even more convenient for their employees to get a shot.
Fourth, we're going to continue encouraging people to get vaccinated with incentives and fun rewards. The State of Ohio had a heck of a fun reward—a new millionaire last week—thanks to the creative idea of the Governor for holding a vaccination—a vaccine lottery.
The grocery store Kroger announced that they're going to give away $1 million each week to someone who gets vaccinated at one of their pharmacies. The NBA, the NHL, NASCAR—NASCAR tracks—they're offering vaccine—vaccines outside playoff games and at races. Major League Baseball will be offering free tickets to people who get vaccinated at the ballpark.
And to top it off, Anheuser-Busch announced that beer is on them on July the 4. That's right, get a shot and have a beer. Free beer for everyone 21 years or over to celebrate the independence from the virus.
Fifth—and finally—we're asking the American people to help. We need you. We need you to get your friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers vaccinated. Help them find an appointment. Drive them to the site. Talk to them about why you made the choice for yourself. So many Americans have already stepped up to help get their communities vaccinated.
And over the next month, we're going to need you more than ever. We need every American to commit to the five actions I've mentioned this month. Go to wecandothis.HHS.gov—wecandothis.HHS.gov—to sign up to volunteer and learn more about how you can help. Take at least five actions to help in June. And you might even be invited to visit us at the White House in July to celebrate independence together.
I'll close with this: We need everyone across the country to pull together to get us over the finish line. I promise you: We can do this. Just look at what we've already done—we've already accomplished together in only 4 months.
We know it for a fact: Americans could do anything when we do it together. So, please, do your part. Give it your all through July the 4. Let's reach our 70-percent goal. Let's go into the summer freer and safer. Let's celebrate a truly historic Independence Day.
Thank you for listening. Please get engaged. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Ransomware Attack on the JBS Foods Network/Russia-U.S. Relations 
Q. Mr. President, will you retaliate against Russia for this latest ransomware attack?

1-Jun-21,"Remarks on Commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma","The President. Well, thank you. Please, if you have a seat, sit down. And I've got to make one check here.
[At this point, the President left the podium to greet audience members. He then returned to the podium, continuing his remarks as follows.]
I just had to make sure the two girls got ice cream when this is over. [Laughter] Imagine how excited you'd be when you're—4, 5?
Audience member. Almost 5.
The President. Almost 5 years old, coming to hear a President speak. [Laughter] My Lord. In my faith, we call that purgatory. [Laughter]
Lauren, thank you for that gracious introduction. And in case you were wondering, I—in Delaware—we're a small State—we have the eighth-largest Black population in America, and we have one of the most talented Members of Congress. And so if I didn't walk around and pay my tribute to Lisa Blunt Rochester my Congresswoman, immediately—that was—how are you, Rev? Good to see you.
We've got a distinguished group of people here, and I want to thank Lauren for sharing the powerful story and for helping the country understand what's happening here.
And to all of the descendants here today and to the community and civil rights leaders and Members of the Congressional Black Caucus that are here: Thank you for making sure we all remember and we never forget.
You know, there's a verse in First Corinthians that says, ""For now, we see in a mirror dimly, but then, face to face, now I know in part, then I shall know fully."" It is—I just toured the Hall of Survivors here in Greenwood Cultural Center, and I want to thank the incredible staff for hosting us here. And—I mean that sincerely. Thank you.
And if I didn't say what my father would insist on, please excuse my back. [Laughter] I apologize.
But the tour—in the tour, I met Mother Randle, who's only 56 years old. [Laughter] God love her. And Mother Fletcher, who's 67 years old. [Laughter] And her brother Van Ellis, who's 100 years old. [Laughter] And he looks like he's 60. Thank you for spending so much time with me. I really mean it. It was a great honor. A genuine honor. You are the three known remaining survivors of a story seen in the mirror dimly. But no longer. Now your story will be known in full view.
The events we speak of today took place 100 years ago. And yet I'm the first President in 100 years ever to come to Tulsa—I say that not as a compliment about me, but to think about it—a hundred years, and the first President to be here during that entire time and in this place, in this ground, to acknowledge the truth of what took place here.
For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness. But just because history is silent, it doesn't mean that it did not take place. And while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing. It erases nothing. Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous they can't be buried, no matter how hard people try.
And so it is here. Only—only—with truth can come healing and justice and repair. Only with truth, facing it. But that isn't enough. First, we have to see, hear, and give respect to Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, and Mr. Van Ellis. And to all those lost so many years ago, to all the descendants of those who suffered, to this community—that's why we're here: to shine a light, to make sure America knows the story in full.
May 1921: Formerly enslaved Black people and their descendants are here in Tulsa, a boom town of oil and opportunity in a new frontier. On the north side, across the rail tracks that divided the city already segregated by law, they built something of their own, worthy, worthy of their talent and their ambition: Greenwood, a community, a way of life. Black doctors and lawyers, pastors, teachers; running hospitals, law practices, libraries, churches, schools.
Black veterans, like a man I had the privilege of giving a Command Coin to, who fought—volunteered and fought and came home and still faced such prejudice. Veterans had been back a few years helping after winning the first World War, building a new life back home with pride and confidence, who were a mom-and—they were, at the time—mom-and-pop Black diners, grocery stores, barber shops, tailors—the things that make up a community.
At the Dreamland Theatre, a young Black couple, holding hands, falling in love. Friends gathered at music clubs and pool halls; at the Monroe family roller-skating rink. Visitors staying in hotels, like the Stradford. All around, Black pride shared by the professional class and the working class who lived together, side by side, for blocks on end.
Mother Randle was just 6 years old—6 years old—living with her grandmom. She said she was lucky to have a home and toys and fortunate to live without fear. Mother Fletcher was 7 years old, the second of seven children, the youngest, being Mr. Van Ellis, was just a few months old. The children of former sharecroppers, when they went to bed at night in Greenwood, Mother Fletcher says they fell asleep rich in terms of the wealth—not real wealth, but a different wealth—a wealth in culture and community and heritage.
But 1 night—1 night—changed everything. Everything changed. While Greenwood was a community to itself, it was not separated from the outside. It wasn't everyone, but there was enough hate, resentment, and vengeance in the community. Enough people who believed that America does not belong to everyone and not everyone is created equal—Native Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Black Americans—a belief enforced by law, by badge, by hood and by noose.
And it speaks to that—lit the fuse. It lit it by the spark that it provided—a fuse of fury—was an innocent interaction that turned into an—a terrible, terrible headline allegation of a Black male teenager attacking a White female teenager. A White mob of 1,000 gathered around the courthouse where the Black teenager was being held, ready to do what still occurred: lynch that young man that night. But 75 Black men, including Black veterans, arrived to stand guard.
Words were exchanged, then a scuffle, then shots fired. Hell was unleashed. Literal hell was unleashed. Through the night and into the morning, the mob terrorized Greenwood. Torches and guns. Shooting at will. A mob tied a Black man by the waist to the back of their truck with his head banging along the pavement as they drove off. A murdered Black family draped over the fence of their home outside. An elderly couple, knelt by their bed, praying to God with their heart and their soul, when they were shot in the back of their heads.
Private planes—private planes—dropping explosives, the first and only domestic aerial assault of its kind on an American city here in Tulsa. Eight of Greenwood's nearly two dozen churches burned, like Mt. Zion, across the street, at Vernon AME. Mother Randle said it was like war. Mother Fletcher says, all these years later, she still sees Black bodies around.
The Greenwood newspaper publisher A.J. Smitherton—excuse me—Smitherman penned a poem of what he heard and felt that night. And here's the poem. He said, ""Kill them, burn them, set the pace . . . teach them how to keep their place. Reign of murder, theft, and plunder was the order of the night."" That's what he remembered in the poem that he wrote.
One hundred years ago at this hour, on this first day of June, smoke darkened the Tulsa sky, rising from 35 blocks of Greenwood that were left in ash and ember, razed and in rubble. Less than 24 hours—in less than 24 hours, 1,100 Black homes and businesses were lost. Insurance companies—they had insurance, many of them—rejected claims of damage. Ten thousand people were left destitute and homeless, placed in internment camps.
As I was told today, they were told, ""Don't you mention you were ever in a camp, or we'll come and get you."" That's what survivors told me. Yet no one—no arrests of the mob were made. None. No proper accounting of the dead. The death toll records by local officials said there were 36 people. That's all. Thirty-six people.
But based on studies, records, and accounts, the likelihood—the likely number is much more, in the multiple of hundreds. Untold bodies dumped into mass graves. Families who, at the time, waited for hours and days to know the fate of their loved ones are now descendants who have gone 100 years without closure.
But you know, as we speak, the process of exhuming the unmarked graves has started. And at this moment, I'd like to pause for a moment of silence for the fathers, the mothers, the sisters, sons, and daughters, friends of God and Greenwood. They deserve dignity, and they deserve our respect. May their souls rest in peace.
[The President paused to observe a moment of silence.]
My fellow Americans, this was not a riot. This was a massacre, among the worst in our history, but not the only one. And for too long, forgotten by our history. As soon as it happened, there was a clear effort to erase it from our memory—our collective memories—from the news and everyday conversations. For a long time, schools in Tulsa didn't even teach it, let alone schools elsewhere.
And most people didn't realize that, a century ago, a second Ku Klux Klan had been founded—the second Ku Klux Klan had been founded. A friend of mine, Jon Meacham—I had written when I said I was running to restore the soul of America—he wrote a book called ""The Soul of America,"" not because of what I said. And there's a picture about page 160 in his book, showing over 30,000 Ku Klux Klan members in full regalia, Reverend—pointed hats, the robes—marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC. Jesse, you know all about this. Washington—Washington, D.C.
If my memory is correct, there were 37 Members of the House of Representatives who were open members of the Klan. There were five, if I'm not mistaken—it could have been seven; I think it was five—Members of the United States Senate, open members of the Klan. Multiple Governors who were open members of the Klan.
Most people didn't realize that, a century ago, the Klan was founded just 6 years before the horrific destruction here in Tulsa. And one of the reasons why it was founded was because of guys like me, who were Catholic. It wasn't about African Americans, then; it was about making sure that all those Polish and Irish and Italian and Eastern European Catholics who came to the United States after World War I would not pollute Christianity.
The flames from those burning crosses torched every region of the country. Millions of White Americans belonged to the Klan, and they weren't even embarrassed by it; they were proud of it.
And that hate became embedded systematically and systemically in our laws and our culture. We do ourselves no favors by pretending none of this ever happened or that it doesn't impact us today, because it does still impact us today.
We can't just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know. We should know the good, the bad, everything. That's what great nations do: They come to terms with their dark sides. And we're a great nation.
The only way to build a common ground is to truly repair and to rebuild. I come here to help fill the silence, because in silence, wounds deepen. And only—as painful as it is, only in remembrance do wounds heal. We just have to choose to remember.
We memorialize what happened here in Tulsa so it can be—so it can't be erased. We know here, in this hallowed place, we simply can't bury pain and trauma forever. And at some point, there will be a reckoning, an inflection point, like we're facing right now as a nation. What many people hadn't seen before, or simply refused to see, cannot be ignored any longer. You see it in so many places.
And there's greater recognition that, for too long, we've allowed a narrowed, cramped view of the promise of this Nation to fester: the view that America is a zero-sum game where there's only one winner. ""If you succeed, I fail. If you get ahead, I fall behind. If you get a job, I lose mine."" And maybe worst of all, ""If I hold you down, I lift myself up,"" instead of ""If you do well, we all do well."" We see that in Greenwood.
This story isn't about the loss of life, but the—a loss of living, of wealth and posterity [prosperity]* and possibilities that still reverberates today. Mother Fletcher talks about how she was only able to attend school until the fourth grade and eventually found work in the shipyards, as a domestic worker. Mr. Van Ellis has shared how, even after enlisting and serving in World War II, he still came home to struggle with a segregated America.
Imagine all those hotels and dinners [diners]* and mom-and-pop shops that could been—have been passed down this past hundred years. Imagine what could have been done for Black families in Greenwood: financial security and generational wealth.
If you come from backgrounds like my family—a working class, middle class family—the only way we were ever able to generate any wealth was in equity in our homes. Imagine what they contributed then and what they could have contributed all these years. Imagine a thriving Greenwood in North Tulsa for the last hundred years, what that would have meant for all of Tulsa, including the White community.
While the people of Greenwood rebuilt again in the years after the massacre, it didn't last. Eventually neighborhoods were redlined on maps, locking Black Tulsa out of homeownerships. A highway was built right through the heart of the community. Lisa, I was talking about our west side—what 95 did to it after we were occupied by the military, after Dr. King was murdered. The community—cutting off Black families and businesses from jobs and opportunity. Chronic underinvestment from State and Federal Governments denied Greenwood even just a chance at rebuilding.
We must find the courage to change the things we know we can change. That's what Vice President Harris and I are focused on, along with our entire administration, including our Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Marcia Fudge, who is here today.
Because today we're announcing two expanded efforts targeted toward Black wealth creation that will also help the entire community. The first is: My administration has launched an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing. That includes everything from redlining to the cruel fact that a home owned by a Black family is too often appraised at a lower value than a similar home owned by a White family.
And I might add—and I need help if you have an answer to this; I can't figure this one out, Congressman Horsford. But if you live in a Black community and there's another one on the other side of the highway—it's a White community; it's the—built by the same builder, and you have a better driving record than they guy with the same car in the White community, you're going to pay more for your auto insurance.
Shockingly, the percentage of Black American homeownership is lower today in America than when the Fair Housing Act was passed more than 50 years ago. Lower today. That's wrong. And we're committing to changing that. Just imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans the ability to own their own home and build generational wealth, we made it possible for them to buy a home and build equity into that—into that home and provide for their families.
Second, small businesses are the engines of our economy and the glue of our communities. As President, my administration oversees hundreds of billions of dollars in Federal contracts for everything from refurbishing decks of aircraft carriers, to installing railings in Federal buildings, to professional services.
We have a thing called—I won't go into it all because there's not enough time now. But I'm determined to use every taxpayer's dollar that is assigned to me to spend, going to American companies and American workers to build American products. And as part of that, I'm going to increase the share of the dollars the Federal Government spends to small, disadvantaged businesses, including Black and Brown small businesses.
Right now it calls for 10 percent; I'm going to move that to 15 percent of every dollar spent will be spent with those. I have the authority to do that. Just imagine if, instead of denying millions of entrepreneurs the ability to access capital and contracting, we made it possible to take their dreams to the marketplace to create jobs and invest in our communities.
Data—the data shows young Black entrepreneurs are just as capable of succeeding, given the chance, as White entrepreneurs are. But they don't have lawyers, they don't have accountants, but they have great ideas. Does anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off from the investments those people make? And I promise you, that's why I set up the—a national Small Business Administration that's much broader. Because they're going to get those loans.
Instead of consigning millions of American children to underresourced schools, let's give each and every child, 3 and 4 years old, access to school—not daycare, school. In the last 10 years, studies have been done by all the great universities. It shows that, if increased by 56 percent, the possibility of a child—no matter what background they come from; no matter what—if they start school at 3 years old, they have a 56-percent chance of going all through all 12 years without any trouble and being able to do well and a chance to learn and grow and thrive in a school and throughout their lives.
And let's unlock more than—an incredible creativity and innovation that will come from the Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. I have a $5 billion program giving them the resources to invest in research centers and laboratories and high-demand fields to compete for the good-paying jobs in industries like—of the future, like cybersecurity.
The reason why they don't—their students are equally able to learn as well and get the good-paying job that start at 90- and 100,000 bucks. But they don't have the back—they don't have the money to provide and build those laboratories. So guess what? They're going to get the money to build those laboratories.
So, instead of just talking about infrastructure, let's get about the—about the business of actually rebuilding roads and highways, filling the sidewalks and cracks, installing streetlights and high-speed internet, creating space, space to live and work and play safely. Let's ensure access to health care, clean water, clean air, nearby grocery stores—stock the fresh vegetables and food that—in fact, deal with—I mean, these are all things we can do.
Does anyone doubt this whole Nation would be better off with these investments? The rich will be just as well off. The middle class will do better, and everybody will do better. It's about good-paying jobs, financial stability, and being able to build some generational wealth. It's about economic growth for our country and outcompeting the rest of the world, which is now outcompeting us.
But just as fundamental as any of these investments I've discussed—this may be the most fundamental: the right to vote. The right to vote. A lot of the Members of the Black Caucus knew John Lewis better than I did, but I knew him. On his deathbed, like many, I called John, to speak to him. But all John wanted to do was talk about how I was doing. He died, I think, about 25 hours later.
But you know what John said? He called the right to vote ""precious,"" ""almost sacred."" He said, ""The most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society."" This sacred right is under assault with an incredible intensity like I've never seen—even though I got started as a public defender and a civil rights lawyer—with an intensity and an aggressiveness that we have not seen in a long, long time.
It's simply un-American. It is not, however, sadly, unprecedented. The creed ""We Shall Overcome"" is a longtime mainstay of the civil rights movement, as Jesse Jackson can tell you better than anybody. The obstacle to process—to progress that have to be overcome are a constant challenge. We saw it in the sixties, but with the current assault, it's not just an echo of a distant history.
In 2020, we faced a tireless assault on the right to vote: restrictive laws, lawsuits, threats to—of intimidation, voter purges, and more. We resolved to overcome it all, and we did. More Americans voted in the last election than any—in the midst of a pandemic—than any election in American history.
You got voters registered. You got voters to the polls. The rule of law held. Democracy prevailed. We overcame. But today let me be unequivocal: I've been engaged in this work my whole career, and we're going to be ramping up our efforts to overcome again.
I will have more to say about this at a later date—the truly unprecedented assault on our democracy, an effort to replace nonpartisan election administrators and to intimidate those charged with tallying and reporting the election results. But today, as for the act of voting itself, I urge voting rights groups in this country to begin to redouble their efforts now to register and educate voters.
And in June—and June should be a month of action on Capitol Hill. I hear all the folks on TV saying, ""Why doesn't Biden get this done?"" Well, because Biden only has a majority of, effectively, four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two Members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends.
But we're not giving up. Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed For the People Act to protect our democracy. The Senate will take it up later this month, and I'm going to fight like heck with every tool at my disposal for its passage. The House is also working on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which is critical to providing new legal tools to combat the new assault on the right to vote.
To signify the importance of our efforts, today I'm asking Vice President Harris to help these efforts and lead them, among her many other responsibilities. With her leadership and your support, we're going to overcome again, I promise you. But it's going to take a hell of a lot of work.
And finally, we have to—and finally, we must address what remains the stain on the soul of America. What happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and domestic terrorism with a through line that exists today still.
Just close your eyes and remember what you saw in Charlottesville 4 years ago on television. Neo-Nazis, White supremacists, the KKK coming out of those fields at night in Virginia with lighted torches—the veins bulging on their—as they were screaming. Remember? Just close your eyes and picture what it was.
Well, Mother Fletcher said when she saw the insurrection at the Capitol on January the 9th [6th],* it broke her heart—a mob of violent White extremists—thugs. Said it reminded her what happened here in Greenwood 100 years ago.
Look around at the various hate crimes against Asian Americans and Jewish Americans. Hate that never goes away. Hate only hides.
Jesse, I think I mentioned this to you. I thought, after you guys pushed through, with Dr. King, the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act—I thought we moved. But what I didn't realize—I thought we had made enormous progress, and I was so proud to be a little part of it.
But you know what, Rev? I didn't realize hate is never defeated; it only hides. It hides. And given a little bit of oxygen—just a little bit oxygen—by its leaders, it comes out of there, from under the rock, like it was happening again, as if it never went away.
And so, folks, we can't—we must not—give hate a safe harbor. As I said in my address to the joint session of Congress: According to the intelligence community, terrorism from White supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today—not ISIS, not Al Qaida, White supremacists. That's not me; that's the intelligence community under both Trump and under my administration.
Two weeks ago, I signed into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which the House had passed and the Senate. My administration will soon lay out our broader strategy to counter domestic terrorism and the violence driven by the most heinous hate crimes and other forms of bigotry.
But I'm going to close where I started. To Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, Mr. Van Ellis, to the descendants, and to all survivors: Thank you. Thank you for giving me the honor of being able to spend some time with you earlier today. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for your commitment. And thank your children and your grandchildren and your uncles—and your nieces and your nephews.
To see and learn from you is a gift, a genuine gift. Dr. John Hope Franklin, one of America's greatest historians—Tulsa's proud son, whose father was a Greenwood survivor—said, and I quote: ""Whatever you do, it must be done in the spirit of good will and mutual respect and even love. How else can we overcome the past and be worthy of our forebearers and face the future with confidence and with hope?""
On this sacred and solemn day, may we find that distinctly Greenwood spirit that defines the American spirit—the spirit that gives me so much confidence and hope for the future; that helps us see, face to face; a spirit that helps us know fully who we are and who we can be as a people and as a nation.
I've never been more optimistic about the future than I am today. I mean that. And the reason is because of this new generation of young people. They're the best educated; they're the least prejudiced; they're the most open generation in American history.
And although I have no scientific basis of what I'm about to say, but those of you who are over 50—how often did you ever see—how often did you ever see advertisements on television with Black and White couples? Not a joke.
I challenge you—find today, when you turn on the stations—sit on one station for 2 hours. And I don't know how many commercials you'll see—eight to five—two to three out of five have mixed-race couples in them. That's not by accident. They're selling soap, man. [Laughter] Not a joke. Remember ol' Pat Caddell? He used to say: ""You want to know what's happening in American culture? Watch advertising, because they want to sell what they have.""
We have hope in folks like you, honey. I really mean it. We have hope. But we've got to give them support. We have got to give them the backbone to do what we know has to be done. Because I doubt whether any of you would be here if you didn't care deeply about this. You sure in the devil didn't come to hear me speak. [Laughter] But I really mean it. I really mean it. Let's not give up, man. Let's not give up.
As the old saying goes, ""Hope springs eternal."" I know we've talked a lot about famous people, but I'm—my colleagues in the Senate used to kid me because I was always quoting Irish poets. They think I did it because I'm Irish. They think I did it because we Irish, we have a little chip on our shoulder. A little bit, sometimes.
That's not why I did it; I did it because they're the best poets in the world. [Laughter] You can smile, it's okay. It's true. There was a famous poet who wrote a poem called ""The Cure at Troy,"" Seamus Heaney. And there is a stanza in it that I think is the definition of what I think should be our call today for young people. It said, ""History teaches us not to hope on this side of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice rises up, and hope and history rhyme.""
Let's make it rhyme. Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 3:15 p.m. at the Greenwood Cultural Center.

31-May-21,"Remarks at a Memorial Day Ceremony in Arlington, Virginia","Madam Vice President, Secretary Austin, Secretary McDonough, General Milley, Gold Star families, my fellow Americans: We're gathered at this sacred place in this solemn hour to engage in the most fundamental of undertakings: the rite of remembrance.
Remember those who gave their all in the service of America, in the service of freedom, in the service of justice. Remember their sacrifice, their valor, and their grace. Remember their smiles; their loves; their laughter; their essential, vibrant, and transcendent humanity.
For while we stand amid monuments of stone, we must never forget that each of these markers, for those known and unknown, here at Arlington and far beyond represent a precious life: a son, a daughter, a mother, a spouse, a brother, a sister, a friend, a neighbor.
To those who mourn a loved one today: Jill and I have some idea how you're feeling. Our losses are not the same, but that black hole you feel in your chest, as if it's going to suck you into it, we get. I know the incredible pride you felt seeing your loved one wear the uniform of our country and the pride they felt wearing it.
Our son Beau's service in the Delaware Army National Guard unit, the year he spent deployed in Iraq, was one of the things that he was most proud of in life. Yesterday marked the anniversary of his death. And it's a hard time, a hard time of year for me and our family, just like it is for so many of you. It can hurt to remember, but the hurt is how we feel and how we heal.
I always feel Beau close to me on Memorial Day. I know exactly where I need to be: right here, honoring our fallen heroes. Because through pain and anguish of his loss, I remember the pride on his face the day I pinned those bars on his shoulders.
To all of you who are fighting with the fresh pain of loss, as hard as it is to believe, I promise you this: The day will come when the image of your loved one will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eyes.
The Bible teaches, ""Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted."" That comfort, that reassurance can be a long time in coming, but it will come—I promise you. And my prayer for all of you is that that day will come sooner rather than later.
We all know Memorial Day origins lie in the wake of the Civil War, a war for the freedom of all, a war for union, a war for liberty and for the preservation of the Constitution. In calling for such today, General John Logan, commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, issued General Order Number 11. He directed the Nation set aside a day to honor—and I quote—""those who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion and whose bodies now lie in almost every city, village, and hamlet churchyard throughout the land.""
And so we have, and so we do again today, in our time, where the children of sacrifice made by a long line of American servicemembers, each a link in that chain of honor. We live by the light of the flame of liberty they kept burning. We're free because they were brave.
Here on these gentle, rolling green hills and across America and around the globe lie buried the heroes of the greatest experiment the world has ever known, ever seen. The experiment bears the noble name: the United States of America.
Women and men, all those we honor today, gave their lives for their country, but they live forever in our hearts: forever proud, forever honorable, forever American. They are the sentinels of liberty, defenders of the downtrodden, liberators of nations. And still today, Americans stand watch around the world, often at their great personal peril. War and conflict, death and loss are not relics of our American history; they're a part of Americans' story. Here in Arlington lie heroes who gave what President Lincoln called ""the last full measure of devotion.""
They did not only die at Gettysburg or in Flanders Field or on the beaches of Normandy, but in the mountains of Afghanistan, the deserts of Iraq in the last 20 years. Section 60, when I walk through it, reminds me of the cost of war. Hundreds of graves—hundreds of graves—are here from recent conflicts. Hundreds of patriots gave their all, each—each of them— leaving behind a family who live with their pain and their absence every single day.
I want to assure each of those families: We will never forget what you gave to our country. We will never fail to honor your sacrifice. Each day—starting when I was Vice President of the United States—I carry in my pocket a number of troops killed during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Not an approximation, not rounded-off numbers, they each leave behind an entire community and family. And today, that number is 7,036—7,036 fallen angels who have lost their lives in these conflicts.
And on this Memorial Day, we honor their legacy and their sacrifice. Duty, honor, country—they lived for it; they died for it. And we, as a nation, are eternally grateful.
You know, America has been forged in the battle and the fires of war. Our freedom and the freedom of innumerable others has been secured by young men and women who answered the call of history and gave everything in the service of an idea: the idea of America.
It's the greatest idea in the long history of humankind. An idea that we're all created equal in the image of Almighty God. That we're all entitled to dignity, as my father would say, and respect, decency, and honor. Love of neighbor. They're not empty words, but the vital, beating heart of our Nation.
And that democracy must be defended at all costs, for democracy makes all this possible. Democracy—that's the soul of America, and I believe it's a soul worth fighting for, and so do you; a soul worth dying for. Heroes who lie in eternal peace in this beautiful place, this sacred place, they believed that too.
The soul of America is animated by the perennial battle between our worst instincts—which we've seen of late—and our better angels. Between ""Me first"" and ""We the People."" Between greed and generosity, cruelty and kindness, captivity and freedom.
The Americans of Lexington and Concord, of New Orleans, Gettysburg, the Argonne, Iwo Jima and Normandy, Korea and Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, and thousands of places in between—these Americans weren't fighting for dictators, they were fighting for democracy.
They weren't fighting to exclude or to enslave, they were fighting to build and broaden and liberate. They weren't fighting for self, they were fighting for the soul of the Nation, for liberty and simple fair play—simple fair play and decency.
Today, as we remember their sacrifice, we remind ourselves of our duty to their memory, to the future they fought for. We owe the honored dead a debt we can never fully repay. We owe them our whole souls. We owe them our full best efforts to perfect the Union for which they died.
We owe them the work of our hands and our hearts, to make real the promise of a nation founded on the proposition that all of us—all of us—all of us are created equal and deserve to be treated that way throughout our lives.
Democracy is more than a form of government. It's a way of being; it's a way of seeing the world. Democracy means the rule of the people—the rule of the people. Not the rule of monarchs, not the rule of the moneyed, not the rule of the mighty, literally, the rule of the people.
The lives of billions, from antiquity to our own hour, have been shaped by the battle between aspirations of the many and the greed of the few; between people's right to self-determination and the self-seeking of a dictator; between dreams of democracy and appetites for autocracy, which we're seeing around the world. Our troops have fought this battle on fields around the world, but also the battle of our time. And the mission falls to each of us, each and every day. Democracy itself is in peril, here at home and around the world.
What we do now—what we do now—how we honor the memory of the fallen, will determine whether or not democracy will long endure. We all take it for granted. We think we learned in school. You have to—every generation has to fight for it.
But look, it's the biggest question: Whether a system that prizes the individual, that bends towards liberty, that gives everybody a chance at prosperity—whether that system can and will prevail against powerful forces that wish it harm.
All that we do in our common life as a nation is part of that struggle: the struggle for democracy is taking place around the world—democracy and autocracy; the struggle for decency and dignity—just simple decency; the struggle for posterity—prosperity and progress; and yes, the struggle for the soul of America itself.
Folks, you all know it: Democracy thrives when the infrastructure of democracy is strong; when people have the right to vote freely and fairly and conveniently; when a free and independent press pursues the truth, founded on facts, not propaganda; when the rule of law applies equally and fairly to every citizen, regardless of where they come from or what they look like.
[At this point, the President coughed.]
Excuse me. Wherever Americans are, there—there—is democracy: churches and synagogues and mosques, neighborhoods and coffee shops and diners, bleachers at kids' baseball or soccer games, libraries and parks. Democracy begins and grows in the open heart and the impetus to come together for a common cause.
And I might note, parenthetically: Thank you, TAPS. That's what you do.
And that's where it will be preserved. For empathy is the fuel of democracy. Let me say that again: Empathy—empathy—is the fuel of democracy, a willingness to see each other not as enemies, neighbors. Even when we disagree, to understand what the other is going through.
To state the obvious: Our democracy is imperfect. It always has been. But Americans of all backgrounds, races, creeds, gender identities, sexual orientations, have long spilled their blood to defend our democracy. The diversity of our country and our Armed—and of our Armed Services is and always has been an incredible strength.
And generation after generation of American heroes have signed up to be part of the fight because they understand the truth that lives in every American heart: that liberation, opportunity, justice are far more likely to come to pass in a democracy than an autocracy.
If every person is sacred, then every person's rights are sacred. Individual dignity; individual worth; individual sanctity; the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We say those words so often, but think of it: the right to vote, the right to rise in a world as far as your talent can take you, unlimited by unfair barriers of privilege and power—such are the principles of democracy.
So how would you put these noble principles into practice? How do we do that? How do we make the idea real or as close to real as we can make it? This Nation was built on an idea, the only Nation in the world built on an idea. Every other nation was built on ethnicity, geography, religion, et cetera.
We were built on an idea: the idea of liberty and opportunity for all. We have never fully realized that aspiration of our founding, but every generation has opened the door a little wider, and every generation has opened it wider and wider to be more inclusive, to include those who have been excluded before. It's a mission handed down generation to generation: the work of perfecting our Union.
In 1830, when we were a young nation, disunionists put their sectional interests ahead of the common good. A great Senator, Daniel Webster, rose in the Capitol to defend the Union. To him, we were not just a collection of competing forces, but a coherent whole. His cry, first uttered just across the Potomac in the Capitol, resonates even now. He stood on the floor, and he said, ""Liberty and Union, now on forever, one and inseparable."" Liberty and Union.
More than 142 years later, when I first came to the United States Senate—at a time when our country was so deeply divided over Vietnam, the struggle of civil rights, the fight over women's rights—I had the notion that my first task, as I stood to make my first speech on the floor of the Senate—it all of a sudden hit me: I'm standing where Daniel Webster had stood; his desk was next to mine.
And I was struck by the weight of history, as corny as it sounds, by the legacy of the work we're charged to carry forward: liberty and union, now and forever.
Now as then, unity is essential to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And so we remember those who gave their all in the cause of unity, in the cause of a nation that endures because of them.
We must honor their sacrifice by sustaining the best of America, while honestly confronting all that we must do to make our Nation fuller, freer, and more just. We must remember that we may find the light and the wisdom and, yes, the courage to move forward, in the words of that great hymn, fight as they ""nobly fought of old."" For in remembrance lies not just our history, but our hope; not just our solemn remembrance, but our renewed purpose; not just our solace, but our strength.
This Memorial Day, remember that not all of us are called to make the ultimate sacrifice. We all are called, by God and by history and by conscience, to make our Nation free and fair, just and strong, noble and whole.
To this battle, may we now dedicate our souls, that our work may prove worthy of the blood of our fallen. For this work—the work of democracy—is the work of our time and for all time. And if we do our duty, then ages still to come will look back on us and say that we, too, kept the faith. And there's nothing more important, nothing more sacred, nothing more American than keeping the faith.
May God bless the United States of America, and may the light perpetually shine upon the fallen. May God bring comfort to their families, and may God protect our troops, today and always. God bless you all.","NOTE: The President spoke at 10:34 a.m. in the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery. In his remarks, he referred to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen.

30-May-21,"Remarks at a Memorial Day Ceremony in New Castle, Delaware","The President. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone.
Audience members. Good morning.
The President. It's good to be here on this solemn occasion with so many friends: Governor Carney, Senator Carper, Attorney General Kathy Jennings. General Berry, it's good to see you. And thank you for everything you do for the Delaware National Guard.
By the way, I saw General Vavala this morning. He's become not only a general, but a great friend. A great friend. He was at Beau's memorial mass this morning. Thank you for being there, General. I appreciate it.
And by the way, Hunter has had one shot—[laughter]—not two, and he's just making sure everybody is okay.
Me and my family, we've tried to participate in this event every year because it's an important tradition in the Delaware community. Even last year, in those early dark days of the pandemic, Jill and I didn't want to let Memorial Day pass like every other day. And there was no event here, but we came to lay a wreath at the plaza. It was the first time we did any sort of event since the lockdown had begun in March because we were determined—determined—to honor the fallen, to pay tribute to the women and men who braved every danger, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.
Because as a nation, we must always remember—always remember. We must remember the price that was paid for our liberties. We must remember the debt we owe those who have paid it and the families left behind. My heart is torn in half by the grief. The communities were never whole again.
Folks, it's also an important tradition in our family. As many of you know, this is a hard day for us. Six years ago today, Hunter lost his dad, and I lost my son. It's—the first year after his passing back in 2016, General Vavala did a great honor in inviting us to a ceremony renaming the Delaware National Guard headquarters in Beau's honor.
By the way, I'd note that when Beau made the grade of major in Iraq, I said—I had been in and out of Iraq over 25 times—I said, ""Beau, you're now a field-grade officer."" He said: ""Dad, I have no illusion who runs the United States Army. It's the master sergeants."" [Laughter] ""They run the Army.""
Well, I woke up that morning hearing Beau in my ear saying: ""Not me, Dad. Today is not about me. It's Memorial Day. You should be over at the bridge."" And you know, if he were here, he would be here as well, paying his respects to all those who gave so much for our country and particularly honoring the Gold Star families.
You know, a lot of time passes, but you all know better than I do—or as well as I do—that the moment that we celebrate it is the toughest day of the year. We're honored, but it's a tough day. It brings back everything.
And so I can't thank you enough for your continued service to the country. And your sons, your daughters, they live on in your hearts and in their children as well. And we have to carry on without them. But I know how hard it is for you.
Beau didn't die in the line of duty, but he was serving a Delaware National Guard unit in Iraq for a year. That was one of the proudest things he did in his life.
So thank you for allowing us to grieve together today. I know how much the loss hurts. I know the black hole that it leaves in the middle of your chest, that feels like you may get sucked into it and not come out. Greetings like this and gatherings help. And while I know nothing I can say to ease the pain, I just know that each year it gets a little bit—a little bit—easier.
And I promise you the day will come when the mention of the name of your son or daughter, husband, wife—they will, in fact, bring not a tear to your eye, but a smile to your lips. Folks—and I hope that day comes sooner than later.
Folks, you know, despite all the pain, I know the pride you feel in the loved one and—that you lost and those who are still serving, the pride and the bravery in the service to our great American experiment.
Our military community is the solid spine of this country. It's literally the spine of the Nation. And on my first Memorial Day as Commander in Chief, I want to reaffirm my longstanding belief: We may have many obligations as a nation, but we only have one truly sacred obligation, and that's to equip those we send into harm's way with all they need and care for them and their families when they return home and when they don't.
And all of us who remain have a duty to renew our commitment to the fundamental values to our Nation in their honor, the values that have inspired generation after generation to service and that so many have died to defend.
Every day since I was Vice President, I've carried with me a card with the exact number of troops killed in our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, not an approximation or a rounded number, an accounting of every life laid down for our country over the 20 years of war. Today it's 7,036 military members—fallen angels—have given the ""last full measure of devotion,"" as Lincoln termed it, in those modern conflicts.
And we will never forget. They're the guardians, and we're the guardians. They're the guardians of us, and we're the guardians of their legacy, inheritors of their mission, and the living testament to their sacrifice that is not going to be in vain. Because every American democracy endures. We have been tested, and we still will be surely tested further. But I know that we as a people are up to the task.
Each generation of Americans receives the precious gift of liberty. And we work to share it with more people; to make our country more open, more free, more fair; to bring us closer—closer—to making our American creed a reality for all Americans: that all women and men are created equal; that all women and men equally deserve to be treated with dignity; that all men and women deserve equal rights, equal protection to build up futures for their families and hope and opportunity.
The American creed is the connective tissue that binds us. It's a long chain of patriots that come before us and those who will follow us in turn. That creed holds that the ideals that inspire people to service and that us—fill us with pride when we see our loved ones put on that uniform. And our progress toward that creed together, as one Nation united and preserved through their sacrifices, is the best and strongest memorial to their lives.
Ladies and gentlemen, America is unique. It's an idea. Unlike any other country in the world, it is formed based on an idea. Almost every other country is based on a creed, a religion, a geography, an ethnicity, but not us. We're based on an idea: that we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal. We're unique in the world.
I had a long conversation—for 2 hours—recently with President Xi, making it clear to him that we could do nothing, but speak out for human rights around the world because that's who we are. I'll be meeting with President Putin in a couple of weeks in Geneva, making it clear that we will not—we will not—stand by and let him abuse those rights.
Folks, we're unique in all of history. We really are. But those names that's on that wall, and every other wall and tombstone in America of veterans, is the reason why we're able to stand here. We can't kid ourselves about that.
And so I hope—I hope—that the Nation comes together. We're not Democrats or Republicans today. We're Americans. We're Americans who have given their lives. And it's time we remind everybody who we are.
Thank you all for being here. May God bless you all, particularly the Gold Star families and survivors, and may God protect our troops, because they're still out there. Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 10:53 a.m. at Veterans Memorial Park. In his remarks, he referred to Delaware State Attorney General Kathleen Jennings; Maj. Gen. Michael R.

28-May-21,"Remarks to United States Servicemembers and Families at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia","I'll let you guys get comfortable. [Laughter]
Colonel Ross—Clint, it's wonderful to see you again. Thank you. When our path last crossed, as Jill said, you were serving in the White House. And I never thought we'd be standing here today doing what we're doing today. And, Chief Master Sergeant Peterson, thank you, and to all members of your team who helped put this visit together today. It means a lot to Jill and me.
When I was Vice President and—as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, we tried to visit almost every major military base in the country and, as Vice President, around the world. And you are—simply stated, you are the backbone of the country. You're the backbone of the country.
And although our son Beau was the attorney general of the State of Delaware and had spent 9 months in Kosovo trying to—as assistant U.S. attorney—trying to set up their criminal justice system. And I might say, I've—I can do this with the military; I'm going to brag about him a little bit—he's the only foreigner to have a war memorial erected to him in Kosovo, just below Fort [Camp]* Bondsteel and a highway—the first highway they built—named after him: the Joseph R. ""Beau"" Biden Memorial Highway. And he was a—he was proud as hell of his work.
But then, he decided that—I kept on—he had contracted a—exposure to a virus in—when he was in Kosovo and in Turkey as a civilian. And he came back with a problem. But he kept going to Walter Reed. I couldn't understand why he was—they finally found—it's called ankylosing spondylitis. They finally found a cure. It prevented him from having what they call ""bamboo spine."" But he kept going back.
I couldn't understand why. I thought I knew why, but, Gov, he went back because he was trying to get an exemption to be able to join the United States Army. He was a sitting attorney general, and as all my colleagues—the Governor and Bobby Scott and Congresswoman—they all know is that when you do that—he joined the National Guard. And his unit deployed, and he wanted to deploy to Iraq with them.
So he literally had to give up his seat. Temporarily, he could not have any business done—as you National Guard folks know, you can't do any business with a State if in fact—you're now Federal property. And so he gave up the seat and had the courage to appoint the fellow who had been a Republican attorney general as attorney general while he—while he went. The proudest thing he ever did—proudest thing he ever did.
And he spent a year in Iraq. And it was one of the great honors of his life to do it. Won the Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal, and other awards—like many of you have—but he never, ever talked about it.
I remember we had an event at the White House—I shouldn't be talking so much about my son, but I'm not going to apologize for it. We had an event for Iraqi veterans at the White House, and the President, without telling me and Jill, invited Beau to be there with another 75 soldiers and sailors and airmen. But he wouldn't wear any of his decorations. And General Odierno called him—he served under him—and said, ""Put them on now."" Swear to God. Walking out of the VP Residence, he wouldn't put them on until then. That's the first time I ever saw the Bronze Star on him.
But I'm just telling you that is—he's like a lot of you. You do your duty. You don't expect anything for it except be a little—have—get a little respect. It deserves so much more. You deserve so much more.
And you know, I'm honored to be joined today by Governor Northam and by two great Representatives of the Commonwealth: Congresswoman Luria and Congressman Scott. And I want to thank you for all that you do to represent these service veterans, because they're devoted to you; for the family members, the caregivers, survivors who call Virginia home.
I'm especially honored to share the stage with Brittney and Jerdan and Nathan and Margrit Katherine. I love those barrettes in your hair, man. I tell you what—and look at her; she looks like she's 19 years old, sitting there with her—like a little lady with her legs crossed. [Laughter] Brittney, you're doing triple duty: as a veteran, a military spouse, and a teacher. And, kids, thank you for being there for your mom.
I can remember all those times—and all of you remember, the spouses—when your husband or wife are deployed. Every morning, you wake up, you say that little extra prayer while you're drinking your coffee. You just spend a little more time wondering.
And you know, you only—you make up 1 percent of the population. You're defending 99 percent of the rest of us. And we owe you. But you do your job so gracefully. You hardly ever say anything about what you're doing.
But it matters. It matters to your families—for that time we're sitting across from an empty chair at the kitchen table and the dining room table; for those birthdays or Christmases or holidays when they're gone. You know, there's a famous English poet who said, ""They also serve who only stand and wait."" ""Also serve who only stand and wait.""
I know Major Bean having been deployed to Afghanistan during the pandemic has only made everything much harder during the pandemic. I want to thank you so much—your entire family's service to our country. You're all incredible. You so underestimate how important you are.
And there's nothing that Jill and I enjoy more than spending time with our troops here and abroad. If you're stationed here United States or deployed around the world, I've been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 20—I think it's 25 times. And I've seen—I wish everyone could see what you do when you're there. I wish they could see every day how you saddle up, how you jump in that cockpit. Just see—no, you're just doing your job.
Not to mention all of the troops I've had the chance to visit in the Middle East and Europe and the Indo-Pacific region. We've traveled all over. Jill has traveled all over with me on her own visits to servicemembers in Iraq. I think she's the only Second Lady ever to go into the middle of a war zone, because she wanted to be there and see you.
I always want you to know—always—that the issues you and your family are facing, we need to know how we can support you better. I mean it sincerely from the bottom of my heart: support you better. There's reason for that. As I said, we Bidens are proud to have family in the military. And our son Beau's service was among the achievements, as I said, he was most proud of.
My heart swelled to see him in uniform. When I went into Iraq—I was there for five times—when he was in Baghdad. [Laughter] And I remember, the first time I saw him, his name was ""Hunter."" I said, ""What in the hell happened?"" He said, ""Dad, I didn't want anybody to do me any special favors because my Vice President is my dad."" He got permission to put a different name tag on.
I also remember what it was like to listen to him talk about the needs that people had when he got back home; about all the folks he served with who came back with posttraumatic stress. And he was back being attorney general, having to deal with that.
But here's the point: You do so much and you ask for so little. You know, our experience is a fraction of what so many of you and your families have gone through, a family like Brittney and her kids. You're the absolute best America has to offer: our heart, our honor, your solid steel spine.
So my message to all of you is quite simple: Thank you. Thank you. Not ""thank you for your service""—just thank you for who you are, because it's contagious. Thank you for choosing a selfless service to your country.
I know we have mostly soldiers and airmen in attendance today, but there can be a lot of friendly rivalries on a base. Each branch has its own proud, cherished traditions and culture. I know how proud Langley is of their premier fifth-generation F-22 Raptor Wing. Oh, God, I'd love to go up in one of those. I asked: ""I'm your Commander in Chief. Why the hell can't I command you let me go up in one?"" But you know, they won't let me do that.
And Fort Eustis hosts one of Army's busiest airfields, which is led by the Air Force, primarily used by the Navy. [Laughter] It's all about as joint as it can possibly get. Every day, the more than 20,000 members of the Air Force and Army, along with civilian personnel, come to work with a shared mission. No matter which branch of our Armed Forces you proudly represent, you're part of the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. That's not hyperbole. The greatest fighting force in the history of the world.
You're integral to the most powerful nation in the world. There's been no Army, Navy, or Air Force ever like you—or Marines. Here at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, you enable the success of our mission around the world. You provide intelligence support and airpower. You ensure our soldiers and airmen are ready, trained to deploy the COCOMs around the world, including, this year, adhering to COVID-19 safety protocols and quarantines before to ship out in order to minimize the spread of the virus.
I know that many of you deployed yourselves, probably more than once. Over the past 20 years, our volunteer force and our military families have made incredible sacrifices for this country. Early in my term as Vice President, when I traveled overseas, I'd sometimes meet service men and women who were deployed their fourth, fifth, sixth times. I remember going into Baghdad, just remember—and those of you who had to fly in, you'd do those circular deals so we wouldn't get shot at and we wouldn't get hit.
I walked up in the cockpit of a silver bullet that they had me in. And I asked—I said, ""How many""—there were five people in the cockpit at the time—the loadmaster as well. I said, ""How many is this your first tour?"" Nobody raised their hand. ""How many the second tour?"" Nobody raised their hand. ""Third tour?"" Two raised their hand. ""Fourth tour?"" Two raised their hand. ""Fifth tour?"" One raised their hand. No other war have you gone in, served, and got back up and go back again and again and again. Once. Once.
Wiping the blood off the seat of an up-armored Humvee is enough to get you focused. Then, to saddle up next time and go back and back again? You're incredible. You're incredible. The country—they owe you, and they're—this time, they're more appreciative. In my generation, you didn't come home and get off an airplane in a uniform in an airport coming back from Vietnam. People will treat you with respect, but they have no idea the sacrifices you make in theater.
As we bring—as we get close to bringing down the longest war drawdown in American history—our troop presence in Afghanistan—I want to recognize the significance to—of what all of you, the United States Armed Forces, have accomplished in the past 20 years.
We went to Afghanistan with a clear purpose: to get the people who attacked us on 9/11 and to prevent Al Qaida from using Afghanistan as a base from which to attack America in the future. We achieved that purpose; you achieved that purpose. Year after year, deployment after deployment, American troops pursued the terrorist threat through some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planet.
I have now had the pleasure, as they say, of being to every part of Afghanistan, from the FOBs up in the Kunar Valley; down south, looking at all those poppy fields; and all in between. It's one godforsaken landscape.
But you all just showed up and did your job, and it helped make sure there hasn't been another attack on the homeland from Afghanistan for the last 20 years. And you never gave up until we delivered justice to Usama bin Laden. I got criticized after 9/11 for saying, ""We'll follow the son of a gun to the gates of hell until we get him."" It's exactly what you did. That's exactly what you did. And you got him.
And now, as we draw down, we're also going to focus on the urgent work of rebuilding over-the-horizon capabilities that will allow us to take out Al Qaida if they return to Afghanistan, but to focus on the threat that has metastasized. The greatest threat and likelihood of attack from Al Qaida or ISIS is not going to be from Afghanistan, it's going to be from five other regions of the world that have significantly more presence of both Al Qaida and organizational structures, including ISIS.
We're going to update our security stance and turn our forces to the threats that will dominate our future to ensure the security of the American people for decades to come.
But we'll never, ever, ever forget the terrible cost that we paid as a nation. Many of you likely have lost friends and colleagues in Afghanistan and Iraq. I know this is personal to you, especially as you head into Memorial Day weekend. We as a nation will always remember and pay tribute to those we lost.
After I announced my decision to end the war in Afghanistan, the first thing I did was visit Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery, just walk through those headstones, seeing all those stones. Our son did not die in Iraq, but he came back—went as an incredibly healthy young man and came back with a severe brain tumor, because his hooch was just downwind from those burn pits—I don't know if that's the reason. But he came home—it was just a matter of how long he lived.
I still carry with me—every single solitary day I have my staff, for the last—since the war began—I have my schedule. In the back of my schedule, it says: ""U.S. daily troop update. U.S. troops died in Iraq and Afghanistan: 6,927""—not ""over 6,000."" Total fallen angels across the board: over 7,000.
Every one of these lives lost is a tragedy, an empty seat at the dinner table, a missing voice at the holidays. Every one of them left behind a whole community—not just one, a whole community. We can never repay that debt. But I promise you this—and to all the Gold Star families across the country—we will never, ever, ever, ever forget. Each year, Memorial Day offers us a chance to reflect on the enormity of the sacrifices that generation after generation of Americans has made and the responsibilities that we bear—the citizens bear—in return.
I've said many times—it used to get me in trouble 25 years ago, 30 years ago in the Senate—I said: ""America has many obligations. We only have one sacred obligation. We have obligations to our children, to the elderly, and so many more things, but only one sacred obligation—is to prepare you, when we send you into harm's way, with everything you need; to care for your families when you're gone; when you come home, care for you and your families, and the needs that may be a consequence of the war.""
We owe it. We owe it—to you. We particularly owe it to their memories to affirm the very best of what America stands for—to uphold honor and democratic values that are the foundation and the strength of this Nation.
You know, I sometimes get criticized for saying what I deeply believe, having done this for the bulk of my life. We're in a battle between democracies and autocracies. The more complicated the world becomes, the more difficult it is for democracies to come together and reach consensus. I've spent more time with President Xi of China than any world leader has—for 24 hours of private meetings with him with just an interpreter; 17,000 miles traveling with him in China and here. He firmly believes that China, before the year '30, '35, is going to own America because autocracies can make quick decisions.
But America is unique. Of all nations in the world, we're the only nation organized based on an idea. Every other nation you can define by their ethnicity, their geography, their religion, except America. America is born out of an idea: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men""—and women—""are created equal . . . endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, including life, liberty,"" et cetera.
None of you get your rights from your Government; you get your rights merely because you're a child of God. The Government is there to protect those God-given rights. No other government has been based on that notion. No one can defeat us except us.
It's an idea that generations of patriots have fought and died for to defend it. I know that's a conviction that each and every day you all share. That's why you joined up, why you run around danger when duty calls.
It's my greatest honor—it should not surprise anybody; it should be anybody's greatest honor in all of life—to be able to serve as your Commander in Chief. No greater honor.
So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for spending this time with me today. And thank you for your commitment to our country, because without you, as I said—I'll be—end where I began: You are the spine of America—the spine. And I can't tell you how much it matters. I think you underestimate just the consequence of who you are and what you do.
So thank you, may God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thanks.","NOTE: The President spoke at 2:06 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to Col. Clinton A. Ross, USAF, commander, and CMS Greg G.

28-May-21,"Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts in Alexandria, Virginia","I don't know about you all, but following a Governor, introducing the President in front of about half the legislature and the national press when I was junior in high school—no, it wouldn't be close. [Laughter] I just want you to remember me when you're President. When I go by, don't say, ""Joe, who?"" Okay? Promise me? [Laughter]
Death of Former Senator John W. Warner III 
Before I begin, I'd like to say a quick word about an old friend of mine—a quick word about Senator John Warner. I had the privilege of serving with John for three decades in the United States Senate. And I can say, without hesitation, he was a man of conscience and a man of honor. And in his life full of honors, the most enduring was his service to the people of Virginia. And we're going to miss him dearly.
And you know, John took chances. I was stunned—pleased and stunned—when, in the middle of my primary, John endorsed me for President of the United States. It was how things sort of used to be back in the old days in the United States Senate when I first got there. People—that wouldn't—didn't happen that often, but people would cross the aisle to work with one another.
John was a man of great integrity, and he's missed—going to be missed. And Virginia was just fortunate to have him as long as they did.
COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts 
Now, Jacob, I want to thank you for sharing your story. And I want to—you pointed out that my wife works for the Governor. [Laughter] No wonder she doesn't pay attention to me when I'm in—around the Governor. But all kidding aside, I'm very proud of the fact that Jill has—teaching is not what Jill does, teaching is who she is. And she's done it her whole adult life, and she's still doing it.
I know some people said, ""When you're First Lady, are you going to continue to teach?"" She said, ""Yes,"" but I don't think she bargained for having to teach online initially. [Laughter] You know, I—students, I watched her. She spent more time—4 hours a day for about a month—learning how to teach online. So don't feel bad about you all having to do it too. [Laughter] I watched the teachers having to do it.
Any rate—and I just want to say that, you know, we're in a position now—Governor Northam, I want to thank you for your welcome to the Commonwealth. And I want to thank you for all you're doing to help win the fight against COVID. You're one of the best Governors in the country in taking this on, and you did it from the beginning. [Applause]
And, Mayor Wilson, thanks for the passport into the city. [Laughter] I promise I'll leave in time, but thank you.
And Congressmen Connolly and Beyer, they are both Members of Congress, but Congressman Connolly got to the Congress with a real impediment. He worked for me for years before that on my staff. [Laughter] And everything has gone downhill since you left, Gerald. [Laughter] But thank you.
And I want to thank the Speaker as well and the Senate Majority Leader, as well as thank all of you working so hard for the people here in Northern Virginia.
Four months after I took office, we're further along in this fight than anyone thought possible. Let's remember where we were 129 days ago: When I took office, we were averaging 184,000 cases per day nationwide. Here in Virginia, as the Governor pointed out, schools were closed. Main Street had gone quiet here and in cities all across America. Virginia Tech, didn't play in a bowl game this winter, first time in 28 years. And so many joys of life, large and small, had been halted by a long, dark winter.
And today, we've gone from 184 [thousand]* cases per day nationwide to fewer than 22 cases—22,000 cases per day. Deaths have dropped by over 85 percent. Tens of thousands of moms and dads, grandpops and grandmoms, brothers, sisters, neighbors, friends are still with us today who would otherwise have been lost. This has been true here in Virginia particularly. From 43,000 cases the week before I took office to fewer than 2,800 in the past week, a 93-percent decline.
We've been able to do it for three reasons. First, we planned and executed a vaccination effort at a scale and speed never before seen here or anywhere in the world.
Here in Virginia, that meant $247 million in Federal funding for community vaccinations sites; over 360 federally funded National Guard members supporting this State's COVID-19 response; getting doses to community health care centers, a thousand pharmacies all across Virginia; and creating a mass vaccination site in Norfolk initially run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the United States Navy in partnership with Virginia.
The second reason that we succeeded is, Governors, like Governor Northam, have been instrumental partners. Leaders in red States and blue States working with businesses, faith leaders, community groups to get it done at a local level.
And thirdly and most crucially, the American people. More than 165 million Americans so far have done their patriotic duty; 165 million have gotten at least one shot. Americans of every party, every race, creed have come together and rolled up their sleeves, literally, and done their part.
Now 51 percent of American adults have been fully vaccinated. Seventy-five percent of seniors fully vaccinated, leaving nobody behind: Black, White, Hispanic. Across the world—across the board, they've been getting their vaccinations.
In Virginia, 55 percent—as the Governor said—of all adults are vaccinated. I believe that's the right number, Gov. And look at what that means: We aren't just saving lives, we're getting our lives back. Stores and restaurants up and down Main Street are hanging ""open"" signs on their front doors.
And here, in a rock-climbing gym, we're greeted by another—and we're greeting one another with smiles, with our masks off. And I'm about to do this 60-foot wall, but you—[laughter]. I'll tell you what: I work out every morning, but I said, ""I have trouble holding those grips there."" [Laughter] And the young man said to me—he said, ""The way to work your hands""—he said, ""get a kettlebell, a light one, and just put it under your fingers and work it that way."" Tonight I'm trying it. [Laughter]
But, folks, look, in Norfolk and Fredericksburg, fans are heading back to the Minor League ballparks, pools and parks are opening up across the State, families are heading down to spend Memorial Day weekend in Virginia Beach.
And all over the country, we've gone from pain and stagnation of a long, dark winter to an economy on the move, growing faster than it has in nearly 40 years. From anemic job creation in the months before I took office, to the fastest job creation in the first 3 months of any administration in American history and rising wages. Rising wages.
As more Americans get vaccinated, the days grow brighter and brighter. But let me be clear: We're not done yet. We have to reach those who are not vaccinated and make it as easy as possible for them to get protected.
I set an ambitious goal of getting 70 percent of adult Americans at least one shot by July the 4th. Today, just over a month to go, we're at 62 percent. Ten States have already reached the 70-percent milestone. Virginia is at 66; it's moving closer every day. And continuing on all—counting on just all the help and continuing this process is really—I think you're going to get the job done here in Virginia pretty quickly, Gov.
To hit 70 percent and keep sprinting through the finish line is what we're all about. If we succeed, we can celebrate our independence from the virus together on the Fourth of July as we celebrate our independence as a nation. And the future is only going to get brighter because there will be no doubt what America can achieve when we do it together.
I know when I ran for office I said I wanted to do three things, one of which was to unite the country. It's difficult, but this is the first real evidence that we're able to do it. The American people are more ready to come together, I believe, than the Congress and the elected officials are, but we're getting there.
If you aren't vaccinated yet, it's never been easier. If convenience is the issue, there are 80,000 locations. Visit vaccines.gov or text your ZIP Code to 438829 and you'll find the sites nearest you; it will pop up immediately. And in almost all cases, you don't need an appointment.
If transportation is an issue—I want to thank Lyft and Uber. They've come forward, and they've offered free rides to and from vaccination sites through the July 4. So anybody who says they can't get there, call Lyft or Uber. They're doing a patriotic thing. They'll come and pick you up, take you to the vaccination center, get you—wait for you, and take you back to your home or wherever you emerged from.
And you know, if cost is an issue, don't let—don't be concerned; the vaccine is 100-percent free. And if time is an issue, there are 10,000 sites offering vaccinations without an appointment, 1,000 pharmacies in Virginia alone. And the vast majority offer at no appointment—with no appointment required.
We've made extraordinary progress. Every American should be proud of what we've accomplished, and we did it together. But we still have 5 weeks left to hit our goal. You know, we—and I know we can do it. Just look at what we've done so far.
There's not a single thing—and I've been saying this a long time—and I think a lot of the press, they're smart as the devil, think I'm being naïve—there's nothing we cannot accomplish if we do it together. I really believe that. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing we've ever set our mind to as Americans that we've failed at when we've done it together. And, Virginia, you know you're doing your part.
So, you know, I remember I always would hear the—in the last administration, I'd hear when they'd talk about vaccines and that, ""We're going to—and we're going to make great, great progress."" And they'd say, ""There's light at the end of the tunnel."" I was reminded of my generation in the sixties. There was a very raunchy comedian who'd say, ""Yes, there's light""—when he's talking about the Vietnam war. He said: ""Yes, there's light at the end of the tunnel. It's a freight train.""
Well, this time there's sunlight at the end of the tunnel. There's real light. There's real light. And, Gov—I really mean this; I'm not being political—you've done one hell of a job, Doc. You've done a hell of a job and it matters. It matters.
So I want to thank you all. And God bless you, God protect our troops.
And——

27-May-21,"Remarks on the National Economy in Cleveland, Ohio","Thank you, all. Thank you. Thank you. Please, please, please, sit down.
Shilaah, thank you very much for sharing your story; it's impressive. Dr. Johnson, everyone at Cuyahoga Community College, thank you for being here and having me here.
And by the way, to all the elected officials: You know what we call this in my business? We call this a ""busman's holiday""—[laughter]—to have to come and ride a bus again with another guy. You're awful nice to be here. The only thing worse for an elected official when the President shows up is to say—the worst sentence in the English language is, ""I'm at the airport."" [Laughter] And so thank you all so much.
You've got some really great friends here, starting with Marcy. Anyway, Mr. Mayor, thank you. Dr. Johnson, thank you very much and—for letting me borrow, by the way, Marcia Fudge to serve as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
You know, certain places, just by chance and circumstance, can become markers in the course of your life or of a—of the course of the nation. And for me, Tri-C is one of those places. Just a little over a year ago, March 10, 220—in 2020, I came to Cleveland as a candidate running for President to rally—hold a rally here at the community college. Upon unloading, we got word that Governor DeWine—he did the right thing—wanted large indoor events to shut down because of the growing concerns over the virus and spreading all across America.
There would be no rally that night, and life in America had changed. And a long, dark year was about to descend upon all of us.
Fourteen months later, we finally made it to campus. And from a year of darkness, we're now emerging into the light. And I said from the very beginning: There's no chance—no chance—for this economy to come back unless we beat the pandemic. I remember Congressman Ryan and I talking about that a lot on the campaign trail. You had to beat the pandemic to bring the economy back.
And so that's what we set out to do with the help of a lot of the people that are right here. And after administering 271 million doses of vaccine in the first 120 days—and we have—the cases are down now from January from—they're down 83 percent—COVID cases—down. The number of deaths has fallen by 85 percent.
Schools are reopening. Businesses are reopening. Restaurants are reopening. I hear that, as last night's vaccine lottery, Ohio has a new millionaire. [Laughter] I tell you what: Who woulda thunk it? A million bucks for getting the vaccine. [Laughter] But it's working. Now, 56 percent of Ohioans have had at least one shot. We've got to get to 70 percent. That's the goal.
We've turned the tide on the once-in-a-century pandemic. We've turned the tide on a once-in-a-generation economic crisis. And families are beginning to be able to breathe just a little bit easier.
We still have work to do, but our future today is as bright and as wide open as it ever has been. And now we're faced with a question: What kind of economy are we going to build for tomorrow? What are we going to do?
I believe this is our moment to rebuild an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not a trickle-down economy from the very wealthy. That has never benefited people who are at this college or any other place where they're trying to make a living.
To build an economy that rewards work, not just wealth. An economy that works for the backbone of this country, the people who get up every single day, work hard, raise their families, pay their taxes, serve their country, volunteer in their communities, just looking for a little bit of breathing room.
My dad used to say, ""Just a little bit of breathing room, honey."" And Tim has heard me say this a thousand times—my dad used to say, ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'""
The last few months have demonstrated what that economy can look like. When our event here was canceled in March, our economy was on the brink of collapse. My mom used to have expression, she'd say: ""You know, the greatest gift God gave mankind was the ability forget. Because if it didn't do that, every woman would only have one child."" [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, the good news is, we forget the bad times. That's the good thing about we Americans: We're always optimistic. But 10 months ago, we were in trouble. When I was sworn in, there were 10 million fewer jobs in America and a lot here in Ohio. But in my first 3 months in office, the economy has added back 500,000 jobs per month. In fact, we've created—with the help, again, of the Members of Congress that are here today, 1.5 million jobs, more jobs than have ever been created in the first 3 months of any Presidency in the history United States.
Before I took office, the average initial claims for unemployment insurance were over 830,000. This morning we learned that number has fallen to below 460,000—cut in half the—and we're at the lowest level we've seen since March 2020, when the pandemic first struck.
Before I took office, almost 24 million Americans were going hungry. Marcy has heard me say this before: Did you ever think you'd see people lined up for miles and miles and miles, going into a stadium to get someone to put a box of food in their trunk? People who never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever thought they'd need that kind of help. Well, that number of hungry Americans—food-starved Americans—has dropped by 30 percent. Still too many, but there's clear progress.
Before I took office, independent experts were projecting that our economy would grow at 3 to 4 percent in the year 2021. But they're now projecting that growth will be 6 percent or higher in 2021, the fastest growth in this country in 40 years.
To sum it up: COVID cases are down, COVID deaths are down, unemployment filings are down, hunger is down, vaccinations are up, jobs are up, growth is up, people gaining health coverage is up, small business confidence is up. Put it simply: America is coming back. America is on the move.
And that wasn't an accident. It wasn't luck. It happened for two reasons. First, we made the vaccine program a priority. As my friends in Congress will tell you, I got a lot of heat for just focusing on the vaccine. It goes back to what we all talk about. You've got to fix the pandemic before you can fix the economy.
We were able to, with a lot of hard work, get 600 million doses of the vaccine, enough for every single, solitary American. We didn't have enough vaccinators, so we went to FEMA, the United States military, went to the AMA and got retired docs and nurses to come out of retirement—got thousands and thousands of additional people to administer the vaccines that we didn't have before.
We created more places to get vaccinated, hitting my target to ensure that 90 percent of all Americans would have a vaccination site within 5 miles of where they live. And now 50 percent of all of America—more than any other country—is fully vaccinated. Seventy-five percent of seniors—Black, White, Hispanic—across the board are fully vaccinated.
We're getting lives back. The American economy is coming back. And that's the second reason we're on the move. I committed to an approach of building an American economy, a different economy to build back better, not just build back—build back better. That approach recognizes that we do—all do better when we all do well. And the best way to grow our economy is from the bottom up and the middle out.
You know, I don't have any anything against anybody in Wall Street. I don't have anything against anybody making a million bucks, but Wall Street did not build this country. The middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class. That's a fact.
An approach that recognizes that this time when we rebuild the middle class, we have to bring everybody along, regardless of their background, regardless of their religion, regardless of their race. That's the approach reflected in the American Rescue Plan, which my friends in the Congress helped get passed.
Because of that law, more than 167 million Americans got a rescue payment of $1,400 that's gone out helping families pay their rent, pay their bills, buy their groceries, and—maybe most important—gives them, for the first time, some hope, a little bit of hope. Hope goes a long, long, long way. Those checks matter. Small businesses, restaurants are getting—were getting killed. Now we're delivering the loans and support they need to reopen and stay open.
Schools were struggling to reopen, so we made targeting vaccines—teachers to get the vaccine as a priority. We delivered schools much-needed support. State and local governments—and you know, Mr. Mayor—a lot of them had to lay off their employees—cops, firefighters, first responders—because you have to balance your budget.
Well, now they're coming back, thanks to the Rescue Plan. Beginning this summer, families with children will get tax relief—tax credit, the child tax credit—which is going to deposit money directly into their banks every month until that money is paid out.
By the way, we had no problem passing a $2 trillion tax plan that went to the top 1 percent that wasn't paid for at all; it just increased the debt $2 trillion. Every time I talk about tax cuts for working class people, it's, ""Oh my god."" [Laughter] ""What are we going to do?"" Well, we're going to take back some of that 1 percent money and make them pay for it.
And thanks in part to a part of the Rescue Plan named for an Ohio labor leader, Butch Lewis, championed by Sherrod Brown, who—I don't think Sherrod is here today—hundreds of thousands of retirees and workers across Ohio and millions more across the country can trust that their pensions they work so damn hard for and sacrificed to secure will be there for them, unlike my dad who busted his neck his whole life, and when the company went under, he lost his pension completely.
Even my Republican friends in Congress, not a single one of them voted for the Rescue Plan. I'm not going to embarrass any one of them, but I have here a list—[laughter]—of how, back in their districts, they're bragging about the Rescue Plan. They touted the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. They touted the fact that we're in a situation where the—dealing with—touted grants to community health care centers, touted—I mean, some people have no shame. [Laughter]
But I'm happy. I'm happy they know that it's benefited their constituents. That's okay with me. But if you're going to try to take credit for what you've done, don't get in the way of what we still need to do.
The bottom line is this: The Biden economic plan is working. We've had record job creation. We're seeing record economic growth. And we're creating a new paradigm, one that rewards work, the working people in this Nation, not just those at the top.
We did a study: 85 percent of my Jobs Plan—or 95 percent of my Jobs Plan, you don't need a bachelor's degree; 75 percent, you don't even need a degree that's a community college degree—it helps, but guess what? The bottom line is that people are going to be going back to work. There's a new bargain: Everyone is going to be in on the deal this time.
Now, as our economy recovers, there's going to be some bumps in the road; we know that—of course, there will be. You can't reboot a global economy like flipping on a light switch. There's going to be ups and downs in jobs and economic reports. There's going to be supply chain issues, price distortions on the way back to a stable and steady growth.
In the coming weeks, my administration will take steps to combat these supply pressures, starting with the construction materials and transportation bottlenecks and building off the work we're doing on computer chips. We're also announcing new initiatives to combat anticompetitive practices that hurt small businesses and families. Fixing those problems can help build a more dynamic, innovative economy, and we're going to have a lot more to say about that in the days ahead.
But this is already clear: We're on the right track. The American Rescue Plan laid a strong foundation for a new economy that brings everybody along, but it's just a first step. We're going to build on the incentive and incredible progress that we've made and set America on a sustainable path to faster, more inclusive economic growth. We have to start investing in ourselves again, in the American people again.
Consider this: Three decades ago, the United States was number one—and some would argue number two—in the world for R&D spending—research and development—as a share of our economy. You know where we are now in the international competition? We're number nine. Nine. Meanwhile, China was number eight in their overall spending in research and development three decades ago; they're now number two. Number two.
In this past year, Japan, Canada, Italy, France, and the EU have announced significant infrastructure spending. China has announced that they're increasing their research and development spending dramatically. Japan is making huge investments in reducing carbon emissions and building out the digital capacity they have. The European Union as well.
We're in a race to see who wins the 21st century. Now if I could hold just for a second here—one of the things I've found—I've—you know, I'm supposedly—they'd always announce me in the past as an expert in foreign policy. Well, let me tell you something: Economic policy is harder than foreign policy. You know what the basis of foreign policy is in our stature in the world? One thing: our economic prowess. Our economic prowess. We must be number one in the world to lead the world in the 21st century. It's a simple proposition.
And the starting gun has already gone off. We can't afford to fall any further behind. Now is the time to build the foundation that we've laid—to make bold investments in our families, in our communities, in our Nation. We know from history that these kinds of investments raise both the floor and the ceiling of an economy for everybody.
Like, when we brought electricity to every household in the country in 1930s or we connected the country through the Interstate Highway System in the fifties. They created millions of jobs, good-paying jobs. They set the economy up to grow more quickly and share prosperity more broadly for decades to come. Those electrical poles and wires still help power rural communities 80 years after they were built, and it's time now to rebuild them.
A quarter of all the miles of—Americans travel on roads are on the Interstate Highway System built 60 years ago—60 years after we build it. These are generational investments. Private sector does not make these kind of investments. We've neglected that kind of public investment for much too long.
The pandemic exposed just how badly we need to invest in the foundation of this country and the working people of this country. That's why I proposed the American Jobs Plan and the American's Family Plan, the generational investments we need today to succeed for tomorrow.
You know, as my wife Jill, who's been a teacher for a long time—she used to be about 10 years younger than me; now she's 30 years younger than me—[laughter]—and she is in every way, God love her. [Laughter] She's the only First Lady ever to work full time—full time. She teaches 15 credits at a community college—15 credits. She's a remarkable person. And she's out in Missouri right now and Kansas [City]* and doing other things, nothing to do with her job as a teacher.
But my point is this, Jill has a constant refrain: ""Joey, any nation that outeducates us is going to outcompete us."" It's a simple proposition. You know, think about this: One of the reasons that caused us to move ahead so significantly as a world leader—an economic leader in the world was that in the late 1800s, early 1900s, we were the first nation in the world to say, ""We're going to have 12 years of free—without any limitation—free education."" Twelve years.
Now imagine if—and the rest of the world has caught up with us, and they've now passed us in many cases. Imagine if we were sitting today and say, ""We're going to set up an education system."" Does anybody think 12 years of education is enough for us to compete in the world in the second quarter of the 21st century? I'm not joking. Just consciously think about that. Is it enough? It's not.
And so I'm proposing 4 additional years of education: 2 years of high-quality pre-K for 3- and 4-years-old—not in daycare, in school. The studies show that if you do that, those children have an opportunity of 56 better—56-percent better chance of going through all 12 years of school and beyond without getting into any trouble, no matter what the background or the family they come from. No matter what. On the front end, those 2 years are important.
And then, 2 years of free community college—free community college—to better prepare our people to get these good-paying jobs of the future, jobs I saw students training for throughout the Manufacturing Technology Center.
You know, we need to invest in transportation infrastructure. Drive anywhere, and you can see why we're rated 13th in the world in infrastructure. The United States of America is viewed to have the 13th-best infrastructure in the world. Come on. This United States of America, for God's sake.
We need to invest in universal high-speed internet, more seamlessly connect our businesses and their customers, expand the possibilities of job opportunities in every hometown in America, no matter how big or small.
And by the way, if you'll hold for a second—think about this. How many of you men and women have children who were doing remote learning? Think of all the children throughout the country, in inner cities and in rural areas, that had no internet connection. It's estimated that some of those kids are going to be pushed—although it's only been 1 year—3 years behind in their education.
Look, investment in high-growth industries like clean energy and electric vehicles, it's not just we want to deal with the environment. We want to lead the world in exports of these new technologies instead of ceding the global market and job creation to the Chinese. They're building 20 times as many electric vehicles as we're doing now and the technology that goes with that. What are we doing? It's millions of jobs in China instead of here. It's not that it's the jobs we're going to create here, but that we're going to create to the export the technology. We used to be the net exporter of major technologies.
I also think and am pushing very hard to make major investments in medicines and cures of the future. Folks, diseases like Alzheimer's and diabetes, cancers, they're all on the cusp of being able to be dealt with. You know, if we don't do something about Alzheimer's in America, every single, solitary hospital bed that exists in America—as the nurses can tell you—every single one will be occupied in the next 15 years with an Alzheimer's patient—every one—costing us in excess of a trillion dollars.
So what are we doing? I came up with an idea, and I think is going to get done. And that is that—you know, there's a thing called DARPA, which is the Defense Applied Application Research—it's an outfit that came up with the internet in the Defense Department, it came up with geospacing and a whole range of things that are related to our security. I want to do the same thing at the NIH to focus on those diseases.
It's estimated, if we do spend—if we spend $5 billion a year on that research and development, focusing with—on insurance companies can't—don't have the money to focus on—we can make significant breakthroughs. We're already doing that—already doing that.
If we invest, we can create millions of jobs rebuilding the foundation of a strong, fair, resilient, competitive economy, and save hundreds of thousands of lives. And 100 percent of our investment is going to be guided by one principle: Make it in America. Make it in America.
If I can hold that for just a second, there is a law that was passed in the thirties—doesn't violate any trade principle—saying that whatever money—that whatever program that taxpayers are paying for, you can spend it all on American contractors. No one's ever done it—though, I promise you, I signed an Executive order. If in fact we're building the new deck of an aircraft carrier—well, guess what?—I get, as President, to make—let contracts over $600 billion a year.
I promise you, there'll be no contract let to a foreign company or any of the product down the line. Right now what can happen is, you can hire an American company, and they can sublet to—and they can—their downstream product can all be foreign. All you've got to do is get that particular agency to say: ""You've got an exception. We can't find that job here in America.""
Well, guess what? They're going to find the job here in America, I promise you, or they're not going to get the contracts. These jobs will be good jobs—American jobs that deliver good wages and dignity.
And look, this is about choice. We can give—we can keep giving every break in the world to corporations and CEOs, or we can raise the corporate tax rate back to 28 percent. It was, by the way, 36 percent. It came down to 28 percent, which is still lower than it was at any point between World War I and 2017, and they're making trillions of dollars.
I'm going to tell you this to the press again: In the 10-year period between '14 and '24—excuse me, between '10 and '20—2010, 2020, they made over a trillion dollars. I think that's good. You know what they did with a trillion dollars? They went out, and they bought back 56 percent of their stock. Because the more they buy back, the more valuable the stock, and that's how CEOs get paid.
CEOs used to get paid 35, 36 times to the average employee, and they should get paid. Now it's over 370 times more than the average employee. As my mother would say, ""Who died and left them boss?"" [Laughter] No, I'm serious about it.
Now—so you've got over 50 percent going to stock buybacks. And the other percent—I think it's 42 percent—you get—let me see, 56—it's 40—no, it's 38 percent goes to dividends, which is reasonable. But here's the point. After all is said and done, that leaves 8 percent of that trillion dollars for research and development, salaries, new product, new enterprises, new initiatives—8 percent.
I come from the corporate capital of the world, literally. More corporations are incorporated in the State of Delaware than in any place in America combined—all the rest of the corporate registrations combined don't equal what's in my State.
It used to be corporations felt they had responsibilities beyond their taxpayer—beyond their shareholders and beyond their executives. But what is it now? The average CEO becomes a CEO for 6 to 7 years.
And by the way, capitalism has incentives. One of the worst votes ever made was during the Carter—the Clinton administration, to say a corporation could not deduct in tax—deduct from their taxes more than a million dollars that paid for any CEO. So guess what they start doing? Eighty-some percent of CEOs now get paid in stock options. Why do you think they buy back the stock? To raise the price in—of the stock. They're not bad guys. It's just the incentives.
So if we just raised the corporate tax to 28 percent, which is still lower than where it was, as I said, between World War I and 2017, that generates 90 billion additional dollars into the Treasury for a year, per year. That could put hundreds of thousands of people to work to modernize our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, and pay for it—pay for it.
Put people to work to make sure every American has access to high-speed internet so businesses can compete in the 21st century, kids in every community can get ahead. Another choice.
We can ask the top 1 percent of the taxpayers in America to get—pay the same tax rate they paid when George W. Bush was President. You know how much that would generate? That would generate $13 billion per year, allowing every student in America to go to community college for free.
When I was in the last administration that I was part of—Obama-Biden—the President asked me to find out what the major corporate entities thought was the most important thing they needed. We interviewed over 340—I think it was 348 CEOs. You know what they said—every one of them? A better educated workforce.
But they're not spending money to educate the workforce, so imagine what we'd do—corporate America benefits with a better educated population. Do you want to give the wealthiest people in America another tax cut? I don't—by the way, I don't begrudge them the money they've made, just start paying your fair share, just a little bit. In consequence, it would help every high school graduate earn an education like students here at Tri-C, one that puts people on a path to good-paying jobs in industries of the future.
Look, I know—I know you know what's best for America. And by the way, better educated public helps everybody. Look, my plan is the right way to invest, spreading key investments over time so we limit the price pressure. This is the right time to invest when we have historically low interest rates, investing now with a plan to pay for it. That is the fiscally responsible thing to do.
Of course, there are critics out there who want to stand still. By the way, some of those critics are the same people who said that money was no object when it came, as I said, to that $2 trillion tax cut that went to the wealthiest 1 percent of the America who hold 30 percent of all the wealth in the country.
But when we need to fix a road or a water system, or help millions of people return to the workforce by helping them afford childcare or eldercare or help afford—attend—the ability to attend Tri-C, they think that's a bridge too far.
Investing in America again is going to create growth and more jobs, but there's something else we have to do to ensure the high-quality jobs exist. We must restore the connection between the success of our economy and the people who produce that success: hard-working Americans. The connection has been severed. You all remember, it used to be the case in this country when you were a part of generating success of a company, you got to share in the benefits. That's long since gone—not a joke.
And by the way, I'm a capitalist. But here's the deal: From 1948 after the war, to 1977—I think it was 1977—'79—productivity in America grew by 100 percent. We made more things—productivity. You know what the workers' pay grew? By 100 percent.
Since 1979, all that changed. Productivity has grown four times faster than pay has grown. The basic bargain in this country has been broken. If you work hard and contribute to the success of enterprise, you get to share in the success—that's not the case anymore—so you could carve out your place in the middle class.
That's how it happens. That's how it works in healthy capitalist economies. But along the way, we started seeing the stock market and corporate profits and executive pay as the sole measure of our economic success. Let me tell you something. My sole measure of economic success is how working families are doing, whether they have jobs that deliver dignity. That means we have to focus on wages like we used to.
When it comes to the economy we're building, rising wages aren't a bug, they're a feature. We want to get something economists call ""full employment."" Instead of workers competing with each other for jobs that are scarce, we want employees to compete with each other to attract work. We want the companies to compete to attract workers.
That kind of competition in the market doesn't just give workers more ability to earn a higher wage, it gives them the power to demand to be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace. And it helps ensure that America—when you walk into work, you don't have to check your right to be treated with respect at the door.
""Full employment"" also means more options and opportunities for workers—including Black, Hispanic workers, Asian American workers, women—who've been left behind in previous economic recoveries when the labor market never tightened up enough.
Look, this isn't just good for individual workers, it also makes our economy a whole lot stronger. When American workers have more money to spend, American businesses benefit. We all benefit. Higher wages and more options for workers are a good thing.
A lot of companies have do ne extremely well in this crisis, and good for them. Good for them. The simple fact is, though, corporate profits are the highest they've been in decades, and workers' pay is at the lowest it has been in 70 years. We have more than ample room to raise workers, pay without raising customer prices. Soaring corporate profits and stagnant wages aren't the American Dream, and they aren't the American deal.
Look, I'm not looking to punish anyone or to say business shouldn't be able to make a significant profit. I understand the risk and challenges businessowners face, and they should be rewarded for the success and the risks they take. I just think, after decades of workers getting a raw deal, it's time they be given a fair shake.
Well, wait until you see what happens when employers have to compete for workers. Companies like McDonald's, Home Depot, Bank of America, and others, what do they have to do? They have to raise wages to attract workers. That's the way it's supposed to be.
And we've got to do two more things. Congress should raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. No one—no one—should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty, live below the poverty level. And we ought to pass the Protect the Right to Organize—the PRO Act—supported by union workers.
Look, let me close with this. You know, it's an overused phrase these days, but it's still accurate: We're at an inflection point in American history. It happens every several generations. We have a chance to seize the economic momentum of the first months of my administration not just to build back, but to build back better.
And this time, we're going to deal everyone in—everyone that has been left out—and breathe new life into the middle class and new hope into those struggling to break into the middle class. We have a chance to make investments that Moody's—not a liberal think tank—Wall Street, Moody's—says my plan will increase the size of our economy by $4.5 trillion—Moody's—$4.5 trillion over the next decade and create well over 16 million new good-paying jobs.
If we make these investments now, in 50 years, people are going to look back—and not even that long—your children or grandchildren will look back and say this was the moment when America won the future. Won the future.
Folks, I've said it a thousand times—I mean it from the bottom of my heart: There is not a single thing America can't do when we do it together. Never. We're the only country in the world that has—when we set our mind to something, that have never ever, ever, ever failed.

The President's Federal Budget Proposal for Fiscal Year 2022/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, can you confirm that you're going to submit a $6 trillion budget?
The President. I beg your pardon.
Q. Six trillion dollar budget, can you confirm the topline number?
The President. Well, we'll confirm that—that will all be distributed. And one of the things I want to tell you is that I haven't had a chance yet to go over the details of the counteroffer made by Capito. I'll be—we're going to meet sometime next week, and we'll see if we can move that. And I'll have more to say about that at the time.

2019 Coronavirus Outbreak in Wuhan, China 
Q. What do you expect to get from your review—your 90-day review on where the origins of the coronavirus were?
The President. If I knew that, I wouldn't ask for a 90-day review. I don't know.
Q. What can they get that they haven't found in the last year? 
Intelligence Community Investigation on COVID-19 Origins

Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. Sir, what do you think of the proposal? Is the proposal too small for you from the Republicans? What is your thought on it?
The President. I had a good conversation—very brief, but a good conversation—with Capito, the Senator. And I told her we would—she's going to contact me next week. I told her we have to finish this really soon. And there's another Republican group that also wants to talk.
And—but we're going to have to close this down soon.

I'm going up to a viewing of a woman who worked with me in a senior position from the time I ran for the county council who passed away. Her name was Norma Long. That's why I'm heading home.

The President's Meeting With George Floyd's Family/First Anniversary of the Police-Involved Death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota/Police Reform Legislation 
Q. Sir, how was your meeting with the Floyd family?
The President. The Floyd family meeting went incredibly well. We spent a long time together. I spent—I got a chance to spend a lot of time with Gianna and the family. And we just talked about—you know, it's the 1-year anniversary, and those of you who've been through personal loss know that although every anniversary is—you're happy people remember, it also brings everything back immediately like it happened that day. It takes a lot of courage to go through it.
And they've been wonderful. And I've spoken with the negotiators. I'm hopeful that sometime after Memorial Day, we'll have an agreement on the—on the George Floyd legislation. And so, I'm optimistic.
And I think they spoke to you. Maybe they didn't speak to you; they spoke to some of you. I think they were very pleased with the time we spent together. It was mostly personal. We spent a long time, I guess, almost a couple of hours.
Q. And have you discussed——
Q. And how was the time with Gianna for you? What did you—[inaudible]?
The President. First thing she did when she ran in was throw her arms around me, gave me a big hug and wanted to sit in my lap. And we spent—she also loved the idea that—she said, ""I'm really hungry."" And so she said, ""Do you have any snacks?""
Q. What did you give her?
The President. Well, we gave her—my wife would kill me. We gave her some ice cream. She had some Cheetos. And I think she had a chocolate milk. I'm not sure what the third one was.
But they were in and out. I showed them all—and we spent time—I spent time showing them around not just the Oval, but around the White House. And they were interested, and I gave them all little mementos, especially her. I had a great picture of Gianna when I went down for the funeral—or for the eve of the funeral, and I gave her that.
Nord Stream 2 Russia-Germany Natural Gas Pipeline 
Q. Why have you decided to meet with President Putin? And why are you letting Germany and Russia to build—to continue building Nord Stream 2?
The President. Because it's almost completely finished, number one. The idea that anything that—and it's not like I can allow Germany to do something or not.
I have been opposed to Nord Stream 2 from the beginning, but it only has—it's almost completed by the time I took office. And to go ahead and impose sanctions now, I think, would be counterproductive now in terms of our European relations. And they know how strongly I feel. And I hope we can work on how they handle it from this point on.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. Have you considered canceling the summit because of what happened in Belarus? Have you ever considered canceling the summit with Mr. Putin because of what just happened—[inaudible]?
The President. No, no, no. I—Putin had indicated he wanted to meet with me well over a month ago. I've spoken with him a number of times. We're going to be having a meeting in Switzerland not too long from now.

The President. Well, that's in play. I don't want to speculate until we get it done.
Police Reform Legislation

24-May-21,Remarks During a Hurricane Preparedness Briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency,"[Inaudible]—say to the press. Welcome. I have a very brief opening statement here. And, Administrator Criswell, thanks for hosting us. [Laughter] You know, I wanted a tested veteran for FEMA, and that's exactly what I got in the new head of FEMA. And I really do appreciate it.
She served as a fire safety officer—I've got to turn this on—a fire safety officer in Iraq and Afghanistan—that qualifies for any tough job—and played a critical role at FEMA before and was a leader in response to something I was deeply involved in as Vice President at the time: Superstorm Sandy. Thank you for all that great work.
Already this year, FEMA has stepped up and vaccinated America and responded to winter storms, reminding us that we can never be too prepared. My administration is going to bring every resource to bear—every resource to bear—every time to help American people—the American people weather emergencies. And you know, we're going to spare no expense, no effort to keep Americans safe and respond to crises when they arise. And they certainly will.
Now it's time to get ready for the busiest time of the year for disasters in America: hurricane season in the South and East and the fire season out West. I'm here today to make it clear that I will insist on nothing less than readiness for all of these challenges. We're going to make sure the men and women of FEMA and our other key agencies have everything they need—everything they need—because they've got an incredibly difficult job.
Today I'm announcing that FEMA is going to make a—$1 billion available to the States, Territories, Tribes, and rural communities through the Building Resilience Infrastructure and Communities program, the so-called BRIC program. That's going to double the funding available of last—from last year, and it's going to help communities, including those too often overlooked, and it's going to invest in resilience and better protect themselves to serve for other climate events that we're going to be facing.
Last year, as you all know, we faced the most named storms on record. Seven out of the thirty named storms alone claimed 86 lives and caused more than $40 billion in damage. This year, NOAA is focusing on another severe season, perhaps—and God willing—not as bad as 2020, but still quite bad. And we all know that these storms are coming. And we're going to be prepared; we have to be ready. We have to be ready.
When disaster strikes, we have to be there to protect and also help people recover. And so it's about—not about red States and blue States—you all know that—it's about having people's backs in the toughest moments that they face, ready with food, water, blankets, shelters, and more.
But there's, you know, there—to be, you know, beginning this effort for 2021 is—I think we've learned a few lessons from last year as well. There's help us—we—there, you know, being there to help clear roads, rebuild Main Streets, and so that the families can get back to their lives—that's what FEMA does every single day. As my mother would say, ""They're doing God's work.""
Today's briefing is a critical reminder: We don't have a moment to lose in preparing for 2021. And so, again, I want to thank you for all that you do. And I'm looking forward to hearing from you all. And I thank the press for coming in. Appreciate it.",NOTE: The President spoke at 1:44 p.m.,"Joseph R.

21-May-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and an Exchange With Reporters,"President Biden. I am honored to have President Moon here at the White House today for the second foreign leader visit, head-of-state visit in my Presidency.
The United States and the Republic of Korea are allies with a long history of shared sacrifice. And in a personal note, I want to thank the President for being with me today as I had the great honor of presenting the congressional Medal of Honor to a Ranger in his mid-nineties who was—showed incredible acts of valor and bravery in Korea during the Korean war. The President was kind enough to come spend the entire time there and personally congratulate the—our honoree.
And I also want to point out that our history of shared sacrifice and our cooperation is vital to maintaining peace and stability in a critical region of the world. President Moon and I and our teams have had good meetings addressing our shared agenda. We had a private meeting in which my staff kept coming out and saying: ""You're over time. You're over time."" But I enjoyed our meeting so much that we caused us to move everything back.
But I look forward to continuing our discussion today here and in growing the U.S.-R.O.K. relationship further as we take on new challenges and we take them on together.
Mr. President, the floor is yours.
President Moon. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to express my deep gratitude to President Biden and the American people for extending such a warm hospitality to me and my delegation. And my congratulations on how the U.S. is becoming an example of the—for the world as it succeeds in overcoming COVID-19, achieving economic recovery, and uniting the Nation under President Biden's leadership.
Korea and the U.S. are strong allies, forged more than 70 years ago. America is our everlasting friend who helped us and led us in our times of direst need. And I'm very pleased to visit the U.S. as my first overseas trip destination since the spread of COVID-19 and meet President Biden and his new team.
Even in the midst of COVID-19 crisis, our two countries left the door open to each other, helped with each other's fight against the virus, and kept our people and goods flow. And we are seeing increasing cases of successful cooperation between our two countries' businesses and industries that will shape the post-COVID-19 era, such as semiconductors, batteries, and communication. An expanding cooperation between the U.S.—a center of global business—and Korea—a rising economic hub of East Asia—will be a breakthrough in economic recovery for not only the two countries, but the entire world.
In previous meetings with President Biden, we affirmed our joint commitment to strengthening the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance and bringing peace on the Korean Peninsula. I believe our peoples will be delighted to hear this a day shy of our 139th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. And Korea will closely work with the U.S. to achieve complete denuclearization and establish permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.
The world is welcoming America's return and keeping their hopes high for America's leaders to do more than ever before. President Biden, himself, also underscored the importance of building back better and expressed his willingness to solve common challenges of humanity with the power of example.
Although tricky challenges lie ahead of us, as allies that share core values, our two countries will actively work together to address global challenges such as COVID-19, economic recovery, and climate change. And we will usher in a new era.
Following our meeting today, I look forward to welcoming President Biden again in Seoul, the Republic of Korea, in not-too-distant future. Thank you very much.

21-May-21,"Remarks on Presenting the Medal of Honor to Army Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., USA (Ret.)","President Biden. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the White House.
President Moon, it's a real honor to have you here participating in this ceremony today. The strength of the alliance between the United States, the Republic of Korea was born out of the courage, determination, sacrifice, and of the Korean troops fighting shoulder to shoulder with American troops. And having you here today is an important recognition of all that our Nation has achieved together—both of them—in the decades since.
And I'm joined by my wife Jill, who's as excited about this event as I am; the Vice President and the Second Gentleman are here as well; our Secretary of Defense; Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the officials of the United States Army; as well as several Members of Congress—Representative Ferguson, Representative Crow, and Senator Ernst.
Because, today, we are hosting a true American hero and awarding an honor that is long overdue—more than 70 years overdue. Seventy years ago, on a frozen hilltop deep in what is now North Korea, a young First Lieutenant bravely, out of West Point—and barely out of West Point—acted with bravery and—that earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, the military's second highest honor.
Today, after more than a decade of effort—including support from my good friend John McCain, God rest his soul, shortly before he passed away—I'm incredibly proud to give Colonel Ralph Puckett's act of valor the full recognition they have always deserved.
Colonel, I'm humbled to have you here today, I really am, along with your loving family, and to award you the Medal of Honor. And though I understand that your first response to us hosting this event was to ask, ""Why all the fuss?"" [Laughter] ""Why all the fuss? Can't they just mail it to me?"" [Laughter]
I was going to make a joke about the Post Office, but I decided not to do that. [Laughter] Colonel Puckett, after 70 years, rather than mail it to you, I would have walked it to you. [Laughter] You know, your lifetime of service to our Nation, I think, deserves a little bit of fuss—a little bit of fuss.
You know, when I called to tell the Colonel that I had approved this award, I also spoke to Jeannie. Excuse me for using your first name, but that was my mom's name too. And you and my mom have the same eyes, although you're much—you're too young to be my mom. [Laughter] And they've been married for 68 years. We have something else in—we have one thing in common: We both married way up. [Laughter] We both married way up.
Col. Puckett. [Inaudible]
President Biden. That's exactly right. [Laughter] Well, Jeannie and Ralph actually met while he was recovering from his wounds. And they were married 2 years to the day after the battle that we're recognizing him today for his bravery.
By the way, you all can sit down, I think. [Laughter] It just dawned on me, you all—[laughter]. I understand why you're standing. I'd be standing too, but—Jeannie, it's wonderful to welcome you, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Jill and I know firsthand that it's not just the person who wears the uniform who serves, military families make enormous sacrifices for our Nation.
So let me add our thanks to you and your life of service as well. I told you earlier that expression by the poet, ""They also stand who only—they also serve who only stand and wait."" And you waited a long, long time under many, many, many circumstances.
And that goes to the entire family: Marty and her husband Anthony. Thomas and partner Chip—I don't know if they're here; I didn't see them yet. And I know the other daughter—that Jeannie isn't with us anymore. Just like I wish our son Beau were able to be here to see this, he's not with us either. She's here in spirit and represented by her family. And I know she's always in your heart, Colonel, and never leaves.
I also want recognize Master Sergeant Merle Simpson who fought beside the colonel in Korea. Where are you? Stand up, sir. Come on. Who made the trip to Washington today to represent all of their fallen brothers from the Eighth Army Ranger Company. It's an honor—it's an honor—for all of their memories as well.
Hill 205 was just 60 miles from the border with China. And then-Lieutenant Puckett and the Rangers had their orders to take that hill. As a young officer, Lieutenant Puckett knew that something wasn't quite right. The intelligence briefing indicated that there were 25,000 Chinese troops in the area, outnumbering U.S. and Korean forces two to three—or excuse me, three to two. And Lieutenant Puckett, though the numbers—thought the numbers for the attack didn't align with the basic military doctrine.
The Lieutenant believed in the fundamentals. It was how he trained his men. It's how he'd hand-picked them, chosen them from the ranks of cooks and clerks and mechanics to the first Ranger company since World War II. Physical conditioning. Tactical training. Working as a team. Get the basics right, then build from there.
But Lieutenant Puckett also believed in being there for the fight. He'd volunteered for the Army Air Corps Enlisted Reserve to try to join—to fight in World War II. He volunteered to go to Korea, instead of the safer posting in Japan. He volunteered for the new Ranger company, and then he prayed, ""Dear God, don't let me get a bunch of guys—good guys—killed,"" when he was chosen to command that company.
So, on the morning of November 25, 1950, mounted on the decks of the tanks, 51 of Puckett's Rangers and 9 Korean enlisted soldiers set out to take Hill 205. To make their charge, they had to cross about half mile of frozen rice paddies under fire. And when the enemy machine gunners slowed the Rangers' advance, Puckett risked his life by running across the area to draw fire that would reveal where the location of the nest. He did it once. He did it again. It took three runs intentionally exposing himself to the enemy to pick off the gunner.
Of course, Colonel Puckett had developed a dangerous hobby, as he recounted in his book, of challenging himself to run in front of speeding cars when he was 4 years old. [Laughter] So self-preservation, it seemed, was never a primary concern of the colonel.
When the Rangers finally reached the top of Hill 205, they found it abandoned, but Puckett knew the fight wasn't nearly over. His men established a defensive perimeter and then went to coordinate the artillery support he was sure they would need, and while he was there, to load up the ammunition and grenades, the basics.
Shortly after he returned, the first onslaught began. Mortars followed by a ground assault from the entire Chinese battalion. Puckett's Rangers were outnumbered almost ten to one. During the fight, Puckett abandoned the relative safety of his foxhole, moving from man to man, encouraging them in the fight, checking that the perimeter was holding.
He took a grenade fragment in his left thigh, but Puckett refused to be evacuated. He was a Ranger. He led his men from the front. And over the course of the next several hours, four more waves of assaults came.
Each time, Puckett made his rounds, passing out extra ammo and extra encouragement to rally his men. Each time, he was able to call in artillery support—sometimes ""danger close""—to help break the advance of the Chinese soldiers. Each time, the Rangers held the hill, pushing the enemy back, at times, with hand-to-hand fighting.
About 2:30 a.m., after more than 4 hours of near nonstop fighting, the sixth wave began. By this time, the Rangers had—many Rangers had been killed, and those who are left were exhausted, outnumbered, and dangerously short of ammunition and grenades. Lieutenant Puckett had sustained a second wound, this time in his left shoulder. He had distributed all the ammo to his men, keeping only eight bullets and a bayonet for himself.
For the last time, Puckett called in artillery support, only to be told that the guns were supporting other besieged units. Then, two mortar rounds landed directly in Puckett's foxhole, tearing through both his feet and his backside and his left arm and shoulder. Puckett's Rangers had been overwhelmed, and he himself was badly wounded. He ordered one of his men who found him on the ground to leave him behind. But that's not the Ranger creed.
A private ran for help, and soon two other Rangers charged back up the hill, fighting off advancing Chinese soldiers, retrieving their commander. They had to drag him down the hill, with Lieutenant Puckett reminding them, and himself, that he could take the pain, quote, ""I'm a Ranger.""
Before his men loaded him on a tank to evacuate, Lieutenant Puckett called for one final barrage on Hill 205. And the Eighth Army unloaded artillery, while phosphorus on the Rangers' former—and phosphorus on the Rangers' former position. They did not hold the hill, but the Rangers extracted a high price.
Korea is sometimes called the ""Forgotten War."" But those men who were there under Lieutenant Puckett's command—they'll never forget his bravery. They never forget that he was right by their side throughout every minute of it.
And the people of the Republic of Korea haven't forgotten, as evidenced by the fact that the Prime Minister [President]* of Korea is here for this ceremony. I doubt this has ever happened before—I can't say that for certain, but I doubt it's happened before. The Americans—all Americans, like Ralph Puckett, joined in their fight.
And while the enduring partnership between our two nations began in war, it has flourished through peace. It's the—it's a testament, I think, to the extraordinary strength of our alliance.
And we're joined today, as I said, by President Moon, who—I can't tell you how happy I am he's able to be here. And if I may, I'd like to invite President Moon to say a few words, if that is okay.
President Moon.
President Moon. Mr. President, thank you for your words. I find it truly meaningful to join the Medal of Honor presentation ceremony for Colonel Ralph Puckett Jr., U.S. Army (Retired). Upon President Biden's invitation, I learned that I'm the first foreign leader to ever attend a ceremony of such kind. As President of the Republic of Korea, it is a great honor and pleasure.
Colonel Puckett is a true hero of the Korean war. With extraordinary valor and leadership, he completed missions till the very end, defending Hill 205 and fighting many more battles requiring equal valiance. Without the sacrifice of veterans, including Colonel Puckett and the Eighth Army Ranger Company, freedom and democracy we enjoy today couldn't have blossomed in Korea.
Earlier, Colonel Puckett told me that when he was in Korea during the Korean war, it was absolutely destroyed. That was true, but from the ashes of the Korean war, we rose; we came back. And that was thanks to the Korean War veterans who fought for Korea's peace and freedom.
And now, thanks to their support and efforts, we are enjoying prosperity. On behalf of the Korean people, I express deep gratitude and respect to them. Through the war veterans, the Korean people saw a great soul of America that marches toward freedom and peace. Their acts of gallantry, sacrifice, and friendship will forever be remembered.
The R.O.K.-U.S. alliance, forged in blood of heroes, has become a linchpin of peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. Colonel Puckett and his fellow warriors are a link that strongly binds Korea and the U.S. together. I pray that they stay with us in good health for a long time.
Thank you very much.
President Biden. Well, thank you, President Moon. Now, I'd be remiss if I didn't note that Ralph Puckett's service to our Nation did not end in the Korean war. It did not end after his service in the Vietnam war, where he earned a second Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, and two Bronze Stars with ""V"" for Valor. And add to that, during his service, five Purple Hearts for injuries suffered in combat.
And it didn't end after his retirement from Active Duty or his induction into the Ranger Hall of Fame. It didn't end there either, when he served as the Honorary Colonel for the 75th Ranger Regiment, where he'd help new generations of Rangers during their training missions. Even now—even now—you can find him out at Fort Benning, cheering on the Rangers and letting them know he's there with them.
Over his career, he mentored countless young people. He's always believed that all that mattered to be a Ranger was if you had the guts and the brains. That's the standard he applied when he picked that first Ranger unit in Korea.
In an Army that had only recently been integrated, he chose with—his team included a Black, a Latino, and Asian American members. As my mother would say, ""God love you, man.""
In 2015, during the Obama-Biden administration, when the military was considering opening all combat positions to women, including Rangers, Colonel Puckett let it be known that he thought women could meet the standards and said: ""I want to see them do it.""
He leads from the front. He leads by example. He leads with heart. He is a Ranger, and that's how Rangers lead—that's how you lead.
So now, it is my great honor to ask for the citation to be read and to award Colonel Puckett, Jr.—Ralph Puckett, Jr., with the Medal of Honor.
[At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Jayna G. McCarron, USCG, Coast Guard Aide to the President, read the citation, and the President presented the medals, assisted by Maj. William M. Yang, USA, Army Aide to the President.]

20-May-21,Remarks on the Situation in Gaza and Israel,"Folks, I've just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu. Earlier today I spoke with President Elsisi of Egypt. And Minister—Prime Minister Netanyahu informed me that Israel has agreed to a mutual, unconditional cease-fire to begin in less than 2 hours. The Egyptians have now informed us that Hamas and the other groups in Gaza have also agreed.
In my conversation with President [Prime Minister]* Netanyahu, I commended him for the decision to bring the current hostilities to a close within less than 11 days. I also emphasized what I have said throughout this conflict: The United States fully supports Israel's right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks from Hamas and other Gaza-based terrorist groups that have taken the lives of innocent civilians in Israel.
The Prime Minister also shared with me his appreciation for the Iron Dome system, which our nations developed together and which has saved lives of countless Israeli citizens, both Arab and Jew. I assured him of my full support to replenish Israel's Iron Dome system to ensure its defenses and security in the future.
Over the last 11 days, I spoke with the Prime Minister six times. I've also spoken with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority more than once in part of our intense diplomatic engagement. And I want to also thank the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, our National Security Adviser, and everyone on our team for their incredible efforts to bring this about, this outcome that we're about to see.
You know, we've held intensive high-level discussions, hour by hour, literally—Egypt, the Palestinian Authority, and other Middle Eastern countries—with an aim of avoiding the sort of prolonged conflict we've seen in previous years when the hostilities have broken out.
I extend my sincere gratitude to President Elsisi and the senior Egyptian officials who played such a critical role in this diplomacy. I also appreciate the contributions of other parties in the region who have been engaged in working towards the end of hostilities.
These hostilities have resulted in the tragic deaths of so many civilians, including children. And I send my sincere condolences to all the families—Israeli and Palestinian—who have lost loved ones and my hope for a full recovery for the wounded.
The United States committed to working with the United Nations, and we remain committed to working with the United Nations and other international stakeholders to provide rapid humanitarian assistance and to marshal international support for the people of Gaza and the Gazan reconstruction efforts. We will do this in full partnership with the Palestinian Authority—not Hamas, the Authority—in a manner that does not permit Hamas to simply restock its military arsenal.
I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and democracy. My administration will continue our quiet and relentless diplomacy toward that end. I believe we have a genuine opportunity to make progress, and I'm committed to working for it.
I want to thank you all. And may God bless you all. And I pray that this continues. Thank you so much.

20-May-21,Remarks on Signing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act,"The President. Thank you. Thank you. Please, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Susan, progress is possible. We're moving.
Good afternoon, everyone. As I said from the beginning of my campaign, Madam Speaker, that the campaign for President—throughout, you would call me and tell me, ""Keep it up""—was about bringing people together, about uniting the country. We need to—reunite—we need to unite as one people, one Nation, one America. And that was the thing I was most often criticized about, saying, ""How can you unite the country?"" We must unite the county.
I said it in my kickoff speech in Philadelphia. I said it again when I spoke at Gettysburg. And I emphasized it in my Inaugural Address. A lot of people—press, to elected officials—were somewhat skeptical that could be done. It's just beginning, but I am confident we can do this and so much more. And I believe, with every fiber of my being, that there are simple core values and beliefs that should bring us together as America—as Americans.
One of them is standing together against hate, against racism, the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our Nation. Today I can say that because of all of you—many of you sitting right in front of me—you've taken that first step. This important step.
I'd like to thank the Congress and the Members who are here today, Democrats and Republicans, who came together to get the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act on my desk. Well, on a desk I'm about to sign on. [Laughter]
But I want to thank the Majority Leader Schumer, and I want to thank Speaker Pelosi for your leadership. I also want to thank our—the leader from the State of Kentucky for letting it go forward. It's important. It's important. Most of all, Mazie—I shouldn't have—Senator. I called you ""Mazie."" I apologize, Mazie.
Senator Mazie K. Hirono. It's okay. [Laughter]
The President. I called Chuck ""Chuck."" Anyway. [Laughter]
Senator Hirono, Senator Tammy Duckworth who helped deliver this 94-to-1 vote. When you get involved, Tammy, you don't screw around. You just—[Laughter]—94-to-1.
State Representative Grace Meng and Judy Chu, who helped deliver a six hundred and—excuse me—364-to-62 vote in the House of Representatives. That's incredible.
I also want to also thank, as I said, Republican Members in Congress for their leadership, including Senator Moran and Senator Collins.
And I also want to thank the—as I said—and to all of the folks, all of the people here today who are involved in—those of you, whether you're in the Congress or not, supporting this effort, I say: Thank you, thank you, thank you. We've got a lot more to do. But we simply haven't seen this kind of bipartisanship for much too long in Washington. You're showing our—that our democracy can work and deliver for the American people.
Just days after the mass shooting in Atlanta area, the Vice President Harris and I—we went down to Atlanta to meet with Asian Americans and the community across Georgia. It was a raw and emotional visit we had. We heard about their pain, their fear, anger, and all that existed in the community. And the feelings were—about those feelings that they felt invisible, not seen.
We heard how too many Asian Americans have been waking up each morning this past year genuinely—genuinely—fearing for their safety just opening the door and walking down the street and safety for their loved ones. The moms and dads who, when they let their kids out the door to go to school, were worried.
Attacked, blamed, scapegoated, harassed during this pandemic. Living in fear for their lives, as I said, just walking down the street. Grandparents afraid to leave their homes even to get vaccinated, for fear of being attacked. Small-business owners targeted and gunned down. Students worried about two things: COVID-19 and being bullied.
Documented incidents of hate against Asian Americans have seen a shocking spike, as the Vice President has outlined at the front of which her comments. Let alone—let alone—the ones that have never been reported. Gut-wrenching attacks on some of the most vulnerable people in our Nation—the elderly, low-wage workers, women—brutally attacked simply by walking outside or waiting for a bus. Asian American women suffer twice as many incidents of harassment and violence as Asian American men.
And the conversation we had in Atlanta is one we're hearing all across the country, that all of this hate hides in plain sight—it hides in plain sight—and too often, it is met with silence: silence by the media, silence by our politics, and silence by our history.
For centuries, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders—diverse and vibrant communities—have helped build this Nation only to be often stepped over, forgotten, or ignored. You know, lived here for generations, but still considered, by some, the ""other""—the ""other."" It's wrong. It's simply—to use the phrase—it's simply un-American.
My message to all of those of you who are hurting is: We see you. And the Congress has said: We see you. And we are committed to stop the hatred and the bias.
My first week in office, I signed a Presidential memorandum directing Federal agencies—all of them—to combat the resurgence of xenophobia. Not just one, every agency. Attorney General Garland, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, Associate Attorney General Gupta are all here today. The Department of Justice is strengthening its partnership with the community to prevent these crimes, in addition to its other work to take on violent extremism and domestic terrorism.
And with the new law—this new law, the Department of Justice and our entire administration is going to step up. Right now this is a critical problem of hate crimes being underreported.
It stems from two challenges. First, there's lack of resources and training for State and local law enforcement to accurately identify and report hate crimes to the FBI. Secondly, for more people in communities of color, there are language and cultural barriers in how to communicate what's happening to them. This law is going to make a difference. For example, the Department of Justice will issue clearer guidance for State, city, and Tribal, and law enforcement agencies on how to establish online reporting of hate crimes.
It will work with the Department of Health and Human Services to raise public awareness of COVID-19 hate crimes that occurred during the pandemic. There will also be a devoted official at the Department of Justice whose sole job is to expedite the review of hate crimes reports.
And thanks to two families here today, the law will help State and local governments ensure hate crime information is more accessible to the public: the family of Heather Heyer, a civil rights activist whose life was taken standing up to Nazis marching from the shadows of vengeance in Charlottesville; and the family of Khalid Jabara, a proud son of a family who immigrated from Lebanon in search of new beginnings, who was gunned down in front of their home here in America—in the United States of America—by a neighbor fueled by hate.
Khalid and Heather were murdered on the same day 1 year apart. And instead of sharing the dreams they had for their children, both families share profound grief. And they've shown incredible courage to turn their pain into purpose. I hope you'll not be offended, but I'd ask both families to please stand.
Folks, I want to thank you. I want to thank you for being here, because I know it's hard. No matter how celebratory it is, it's—a law is being changed—when you have to show up at something memorializing your family, it's like you got the news 10 seconds ago. It's the hardest thing to do. I know from experience, it takes enormous courage.
But I hope—I hope—that every day that's passed, a memory of your son and daughter brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. Because I promise you: A lot of people understand, have gone through similar things. It's hard. So I really mean it when I say thank you. Thank you for being here. It takes a lot of courage. Thank you.
Because of you, the amendment named in honor of Khalid and Heather is now law to make sure that hate crimes are more accurately counted and reported and, hopefully, leading to a continued focus on ending these crimes.
It will provide resources to create specialized hate crimes units that will also help States create hotlines for hate crimes at State and local levels that will be accessible for people with limited English proficiency. And it provides resources for training for State and local law enforcement to identify, investigate, and report these heinous crimes.
But of all the good that the law can do, we have to change our hearts. We have to change the hearts of the American people. Hate can—I mean this from bottom my heart—hate can be given no safe harbor in America. I mean it: no safe harbor.
It can't be dismissed like, ""Well, that's just what happens."" My sister Valerie and I talk about it all the time. You've got to speak up. Speak up and speak out. It's on all of us—all of us together—to make it stop.
My message is—to all of those who think this doesn't matter to them or this is not a problem: Look around. Look in the mirror. Look in the eyes of your children. Every one of us are lessened—every one of us are lessened, and we're all hurt by this hate. It has a way of seeping, sort of, through cracks in the communities and children who, in fact, wouldn't have crossed their mind.
Words have consequences, as the Senator knows—he preaches it, he understands it. Consequences. But silence is complicity. Silence is complicity. And we cannot be complicit. We have to speak out. We have to act. That's what you've done. And I can't thank you enough.
I'm proud today. I'm proud today of the United States. I'm proud today of our political system, the United States Congress. I'm proud today that Democrats and Republicans have stood up together to say something.
Let me close with this: Grief, as we all know, is universal, but so is hope, so is love. It sounds corny, but it really is. It really is. And hope and love can be contagious. We're the United States of America. We're a good and decent people.
We're unique among all nations in that we are uniquely a product of a document—not an ethnicity, not a religion, not a geography; of a document. And think about this—I'm being literal—uniquely a product of a document that says, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident . . . that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""
Every time we're silent, every time we let hate flourish, you make a lie of who we are as a nation. I mean it literally. We cannot let the very foundation of this country continue to be eaten away like it has been in other moments in our history and happening again.
I looked at this law that you all passed as maybe the first break—the first significant break on a moment in our history that has to be turned around—not Democratic or—it has to be turned around.
As a consequence, we should do what is required by the obligations of this democracy, by our faith in God and our faith in each other to do justice, to love mercy, to walk humbly. And as fellow human beings and fellow Americans, remember: We're unique in all of history as a nation. This is the United States of America, for God's sake.
May God bless you all, particularly those who pushed this through and continue to push it.
And now I'm going to sign this bill, which is a great honor.
[At this point, a cell phone rang.]
I don't know who's calling, but tell them we're busy. [Laughter] I was going to say, ""Unless it's my sister,"" but she's here. [Laughter]
So I'd like to invite to the stage Senator Hirono, Senator Duckworth, Congresswoman Grace Meng, Congresswoman Judy Chu, Congressman Don Beyer, Senator Richard Blumenthal, and Senator Moran, but I don't think he could be here today. Actually, he should have you—I should put the table down the middle of all of you and sign it down there.
But thank you, thank you, thank you. All right.
[The President signed the bill and distributed pens.]
Thank you. Congratulations to all. [Applause]","NOTE: The President spoke at 2:33 p.m. in the East Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Sen. Susan M.

19-May-21,"Commencement Address at the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut","Mr. Secretary, thank you. Hello, Coast Guard Academy. I tell you what—we're going to speak for about 4 hours—[laughter]—to see if those white uniforms last longer to keep the heat away than these poor guys in their graduation gowns here. God, love you. I thought I was hot in a blue suit. [Laughter]
Governor Lamont, it's good to see you, man. You've been a good friend a long time.
And I understand the senior Senator from this State for a long time, Chris Dodd, is here. I don't know where you're—I don't think you're in the class, Chris. But you're one of the—where is he? Chris, welcome, pal—one of the finest men I've ever served with in my whole career.
And Mayor—Mayor Passero, I want to thank you for being here. Thanks for the passport into town.
And I want to thank, again, the Secretary Mayorkas for joining me today as well. He understands well how vital the Coast Guard is to our economic, our environmental, and national security, and how central you are to our Homeland Security mission.
Admiral Schultz, congratulations on an outstanding new corps of officers. This past year, there can be no doubt the class of '21 is ready for whatever its mission may be. I know this day is doubly important to the Admiral because he's not only the Commandant of the Coast Guard—well, let me say it another way: In 2013, I think, I gave the commencement here, and I was pointing out how the Coast Guard was adapting so rapidly to changing conditions. And I said, ""This is not your father's Coast Guard."" I take that back. [Laughter] First Class Eric Schultz, this is your father's Coast Guard. [Laughter]
And I know it probably embarrasses you to be—to point you out and say that, but I had a son in the United States military. He was very proud. He was a major in the U.S. Army. He won the Bronze star. And I guess—anyway, and when he went to Iraq for a year, he had the—he got the general to agree to change his name from ""Biden"" to ""Hunter,"" his mother's maiden name, because he didn't want to be viewed as having getting any favor—have gotten any favors.
Admiral Kelly, I want to thank to you and the entire staff of the Academy for your commitment to training the next generation of leaders.
And I brought with me a former Academy grad, who now serves as my Coast Guard Mil Aide, Lieutenant Commander Jayna—now, I'm going to embarrass her—Jayna McCarron, of the class of 2007. As we were coming in on Marine One, I thought she was going to light up like a candle. She's so excited being back here. She's an outstanding reflection of this institution.
And, Admiral Kelly, I want to congratulate all of you on everything you've done this year to keep this school open and running, and to be as safe as it possibly can and could be in the middle of a pandemic.
You know, the instructors; the cadets; the cafeteria; the support staff; public works; the campus safety team; the science department; the medical staff; the Morale, Well-Being, and Recreation team—everyone went above and beyond the normal call of duty to try to make it work, and you did. And I hear that Mrs. Paula Springer's ""Cookies for Cadets"" were particularly a boost in morale.
And what you all—what you all achieved together embodies the Coast Guard creed: ""Always ready."" ""Always ready.""
I want to thank you. I want to thank you, Cadet Steyller—excuse me—Seyller—for speaking on behalf your class. And congratulations on earning the honor of being the class of '21's Distinguished Graduate. But most importantly, I want to thank your parents and families for everything—everything—they have done to support you, and all of you—and I'm going to—and those watching online as well. There's—not all can be here.
You've raised these cadets to be fierce patriots as well as young people of incredible courage and determination. You were the ones who first installed in them the sense of service, who helped them hear the calling of a higher duty. So it's your day too.
Cadets, stand up, turn around, and salute your parents. Get up. Up, up, up. I tell you what, and all those parents watching on television, you raised a fine, fine, fine group of women and men.
Cadets, you knew when you chose the Academy, you were choosing a more difficult path than some of your high school classmates. You were signing up for the honor of service and the additional responsibilities that go with it.
But I hope today you take the time to reflect on how much all of the hard work and extra effort you engaged in was worth. And I hope that you take immense pride—immense pride—in all that time at the Academy and all the Academy has given to you.
Because you've achieved something few others can claim: You survived R-Day and Billet Night. [Laughter] You made it through Swab Summer. You got a haircut that showed every damn bump on your head. [Laughter] You learned to square the corners and square your medals—look, your meals, I should say.
And you memorized—and this the part I found would have been hard—memorized Running Lightning [Light].* I'm going to ask you all to stand up and repeat it. No, I'm only kidding. [Laughter] You earned your shoulder boards and your aiguillettes. You passed through 100th week and maybe spent a little too much time at the Slice. [Laughter] You can clap. Come on, man. You're moving on. Show a little courage. [Laughter]
And then, like all the students across the country, you had to figure out what it meant to finish your second-year class [second-class year]* in virtual—with virtual instruction. The pandemic upended so much of our lives. As was mentioned several times so far, last year's graduating class didn't get to have this ceremony in person. But the Coasties fashion that you all have, you met the threat head on.
You adapted, showed your resilience, and you led. The class of '21, you were the ones to test and improve the restricted movements protocols that allowed you to return to class on campus. And with careful precautions and regular testing, you were able to go back to your lives and training here in New London, to conduct your first-year class [first-class year]* in person.
It certainly looked and felt different, I'm sure. But you found ways—you found ways to keep many of the Academy's traditions alive, and maybe even formed a few new ones. You still were able to bring your cars on campus; you just weren't allowed to go anywhere in those cars. [Laughter]
Oh, man, I tell you what, I'd have trouble watching my car sit there. But maybe dipping your ring in Crown Park or having your Ring Dance outside will be a new standard. The Super Bowl of Inter-Company sports may become an annual event. And by the way, congratulations to Bravo Company, by the way, for—on your victory. You can clap. It's okay. Even if you lost, you've got to clap.
And though everything you found—through it all, you found ways to excel in the classroom and athletics. You've got nine All-Americans in your ranks today, including a record setter in the track and field 5,000 meters.
And most importantly—most importantly—you had each other's backs. When times got hard, you were there for one another. That's something you all learn quickly at the Academy. You can't crew the Tall Ship Eagle without working together; it's not possible. So the pandemic didn't change that, but it made it more important.
I know we wish more of your loved ones could be here today to celebrate with you in person, packed into the stands for your big day, especially because so many of you come from families of proud traditions of service.
First Class Rachel Piche is about to become the third-generation Academy grad. Meanwhile, First Class Jacquelyn Tidd bucked a long tradition in her family and joined the Coast Guard over—came to the Coast Guard Academy over the Naval Academy, unlike her mother, father, uncle, and grandfather.
Well, Cadet Tidd, there's a seat on Air Force One if you have to get home. [Laughter] It may be tough. I can only assume that you will enjoy educating your family about how the Coast Guard is, quote, ""The hard nucleus around—the Navy forms in times of war."" [Laughter]
You are a quiet—you're a really dull class. [Laughter] I mean, come on, man. Is the sun getting to you? [Laughter] I would think you'd have an opportunity when I say that about the Navy to clap, but being here together—[laughter].
But all kidding aside, being here together is a victory in and of itself. An important marker in the progress we've made to turn the tide of this pandemic. It's a testament to the skill and military discipline and sense of responsibility you already embody. So there is no doubt in my mind that the 140th graduating class of the United States Coast Guard Academy will reflect—will reflect—the very best of our country in the proudest traditions of our service.
Look, just a—and, in just a few minutes, you'll be ensigns in the U.S. Coast Guard. But the only Anchor Cadet is the only one going home with 240 bucks in his pocket. [Laughter] And before I go much further, as your Commander in Chief—I've been looking forward to being able to do this for a long time; I want to you to—I want to keep a longstanding tradition that—and now, here it goes: I hereby absolve all those serving restrictions of minor infractions—absolved.
Now, you have no idea how much I wish I had been able to do that at my graduation—[laughter]—at my graduation—from the University of Delaware. Because I needed—as we say in my faith, I needed absolution. [Laughter] You all think I'm kidding. I'm not. [Laughter] Minor infractions like using a fire extinguisher to hose down an RA, but other than that, nothing much.
Look, cadets, today you're joining a chain of service that links each of you to our history. It's a connection to the very earliest days of our nation as part of this country's oldest, continuous seagoing service.
But no class gets to choose the world into which it graduates, and demands and the challenges you're going to face in your career are going to look very different than those who walked these halls before you. You chose, as a class motto—it reflects this reality: you said, ""We are the future."" I don't think you have any idea how—how profound that assertion is.
The world is changing. We're at a significant inflection point in world history. And our country and the world—the United States of America has always been able to chart the future in times of great change. We've been able to constantly renew ourselves. And time and again, we have proven there's not a single thing we cannot do as a Nation when we do it together—and I mean that—not a single solitary thing.
And this is particularly important in this moment of accelerating global challenges, hybrid threats that don't stop at our border. We have to meet them on the land and the sea, wherever we find them. And that's where the Coast Guard excels.
The pandemic response would not necessarily have been considered a Coast Guard mission until there were more than 250,000 stranded cruise passengers who needed to be safely disembarked during COVID-19. Now we see, with harrowing clarity, how important halting this pandemic and improving our ability to prevent and respond to the next one is in our national security. That's why 500 Coast Guard reservists have deployed in support of FEMA and other nationwide vaccination efforts.
Disaster response has long been part of the Coast Guard's mission. But with the pace of climate change accelerating, we're seeing more frequent and more intense storms that call for you to respond. Last year was the most active hurricane season on record—30 named storms—and the Coast Guard was always there to respond, even at the height of the pandemic.
But you've also been a part of our response to wildfires in the west, record flooding in the heart of the country. And these patterns are only going to get worse if we fail to take immediate and ambitious actions on climate.
Whether it's interdicting illicit drug shipments at sea before they enter the United States or your stewardship of the environment, the Coast Guard has always recognized the broader definition of our national security. Alexander Hamilton may have been among the first to champion the principle that economic security is national security when he created the Revenue Cutter Service. But if it was true in 1790, it's gospel in 2021.
The best way to meet the wide array of threats we face today is by investing in Americans—in America's enduring advantages and ensure that we're operating from a position of strength. Our economic vitality at home, our ability to trade with the world is essential to that strength. More than one-quarter of the U.S. GDP is transported through the waters that keep us safe. And we're going to increasingly see our skills called upon internationally as well.
For decades, the United States has underwritten international maritime security. We and our partners have kept the sea lanes open and secure. We developed clear rules of the road, behavior is in bounds—important—out of bounds for other nations—to ensure that we can share peacefully in the natural bounty of the sea.
And for decades, those rules supported global economic strength that benefited nations everywhere and helped people around the world develop their economic potential. But, as you know, increasingly, we're seeing those rules challenged, both by the rapid advance of technology and the disruptive actions of nations like China and Russia, with whom I've had direct discussions of this with President Xi as well as President Putin.
Longstanding, basic maritime principles like freedom of navigation are a bedrock of a global economic and global security. When nations try to game the system or tip the rules in their favor, it throws everything off balance. That's why we are so adamant that these areas of the world that are the arteries of trade and shipping remain peaceful, whether that's the South China Sea, the Arabian Gulf, and increasingly, the Arctic.
It's of vital interest to America's foreign policy to secure unimpeded flow of global commerce. And it won't happen without us taking an active role to set the norms of conduct, to shape them around democratic values, not those of autocrats.
And it's why we'll continue to support the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas, which outlines many of the key principles to ensure that our waters of our planet are not exploited by any one nation, but are preserved for the benefit of all. But they're being challenged now—all of it.
So, as we work together with our democratic partners around the world to both update the rules for this new age—to hold all of us accountable to living up to those rules—your mission—your mission will become even more global and even more important. You have an essential role in our efforts to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.
Our new agreement for the Coast Guard to partner with Taiwan will help ensure that we're positioned to better respond to shared threats in the region and to conduct coordinated humanitarian and environmental missions.
U.S. Coast Guard partnership with nations throughout the region to take on issues like illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are essential to building the muscle of cooperation. When distant-water fishing fleets travel thousands of miles to strip maritime resources without regard to catch regulations or internationally established economic zones, it hurts everyone, which is why we sent the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Bertholf to partner with Ecuador last summer to disrupt and deter a Chinese distant-water fleet operating near the Galapagos Islands.
We're fielding requests from other nations all across the Indo-Pacific that are eager to partner with our Coast Guard because of your reputation of professionalism and your unrivaled skill. And the Coast Guard will be an increasingly central element in our engagement in the Indo-Pacific to protect lives, to preserve the environment, to safeguard sovereignty throughout the region.
In the Arabian Gulf, we're in the process of deploying six new fast-response cutters to update Patrol Force Southwest Asia. The Coast Guard's expertise is helping our partners in the region to enforce maritime law and perform search-and-seizure operations.
I'm sure you all saw the pictures of the enormous load of illicit weapons confiscated in the Arabian Sea all laid out across the rear deck of the USS Monterey. Coast Guard was critical to that seizure and to keeping those weapons out of conflict in the region.
Based alongside the U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, you had to face down harassment of Iranian fast-attack boats in recent weeks. And in recent weeks, the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Maui had to fire 30 warning shots to deter such irresponsible and unsafe maneuvers in the region.
The world is changing. We need you even more. And in the Arctic, the Coast Guard is the prow of American presence in the region, rapidly growing in strategic importance as ice recedes and new sea lanes open. We, the United States, are an Arctic nation, and the United States must demonstrate our leadership and engagement, our diplomacy, and our operational skill.
We must continue to model responsible maritime behavior and uphold clear rules of international agreements that will protect and steward this pristine environment and secure it for future generations and—by the way, as you know by now—to protect our homeland security as well.
And we have to make sure that every country respects these international norms. So we need them—we need modern ice breakers, yes, but just as critically, we need to stand shoulder to shoulder with those allies and partners who share our values, including indigenous communities who are the keepers of traditional knowledge about the Arctic waters.
Class of 2021, it's time for you to go out and be the future, to make the future. You've learned your history and your science. You predicted and practiced your disciplines on land and sea. You've shown that you are salty.
This year, the Academy is graduating a class that is just over one-third women, and those—[applause]. You've got it. I was telling the Commandant, I just appointed three women as combatant commanders around the world. And those numbers are going up year by year. As I said, I recently nominated Vice Admiral Linda Fagan, class of '85, and the Coast Guard's the first female four-star admiral.
We need to see more women at the highest levels of command. We have to make sure that women have the chance to succeed and thrive throughout their careers. There's a saying that we use in a different context, a Chinese saying that says, ""Women hold up half the world."" It's an absolutely stupid position not to make sure they represent at least half of what we do.
Every member of our Armed Forces should feel safe and respected in the ranks. That's why my administration is committed to taking on the scourge of sexual assault and harassment in the military.
We're joining a service—you're joining a service that not only serves as America's front line, it increasingly looks like America. This year's class is also just over one-third underrepresented minorities, including some of the highest number of African Americans, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Each of you will be asked to lead people who come from different backgrounds. Your challenge, as a leader, is to treat every single person with equal dignity and respect, and find ways to unlock everyone's talent.
You know, you've already done some important work as a class, including with a class-wide equity walk and discussion groups in the wake of George Floyd's murder.
Our national successes depend on our capacity to harness the full range of ideas and experiences that exist in our country, and to deliver on the promise of the American Dream for all America.
You know, America is unique. America is the only country in the world that's—was founded on an idea. You can define every other country in the world based on ethnicity or geography. We're the only one based on an idea. Not a joke.
The idea was, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men""—and women—""are created equal . . . endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights . . . life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" We hear it all the time, but it's who we are. We can't be different than attempting to continue to have that arc move toward justice.
But with this generation of graduates of new ensigns in the United States Coast Guard who have volunteered to serve our country, I've never been more optimistic about our future. You understand in your bones that our diversity is one of the enduring advantages and inherent strengths to America. In your careers, you're going to face challenges you can't predict. You're going to be asked to lead in ways and navigate new paths.
But when the storms gather or the seas of life grow rough, remember the Coast Guard's marching song to sing on land and sea: ""Through surf and storm . . . howling gale, high shall your purpose be.""
The class of 2021, you have it all. You really do. And we need you badly. And I'm not—that's not hyperbole; the country needs you. The press always asks me why I'm so optimistic about America's chances in the world. And I've said from the time I decided to run, ""Because of this generation."" You're the most progressive, best educated, least prejudiced, most open generation in American history. We need you badly. You're ready; it's time to get underway.
God protect you all as you set out on your journey, and may God protect all those who wear the uniform of the United States of America. God bless America.
Thank you very much.","NOTE: The President spoke at 11:46 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to former Sen. Christopher J. Dodd; Rear Adm. William G.

18-May-21,"Remarks at the Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan","The President. My name is Joe Biden, and I'm a car guy. I got—please sit down. I got through high school and college and law school because my dad ran an agency. And I'm delighted to be here.
And I want to say something else up front: I'm standing here because, about 180 years ago, when I first got elected to the Senate, Gov—[laughter]—the UAW elected me. We used to have the highest percentage of autoworkers of any State in the Nation because we have a small workforce and two giant plants, plus Mopar and a few other things going on. So I want to thank you.
Look, and I want to thank a good friend of mine: Michigan Governor—[laughter]—Gretchen Whitmer. As my mother would say, Gretchen, ""God love you, dear."" You've got a backbone like a ramrod, you've got a brain as big as anybody in the business, and you are so honorable. It's a delight to know you. And anything I can do—as I said to you before, I'll come campaign for you or against you, whichever will help the most. [Laughter]
And, Ange—I want to thank Angela. We were talking backstage—backstage, yes, on the other side of the truck—and I want to thank her very much for being so gracious.
And, Rory, I know you're new to the labor movement, but you're doing a pretty good job. [Laughter] Where is Rory? Rory, thank you, pal. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And everyone at the UAW for being the best autoworkers in the world.
You know, I—and I want to thank Bill Ford and Jim Farley for hosting us, and investing in our workers and in our country. We're at a great inflection point in American history. How we handle the next 4 to 10 years is going to determine where we're going to be 30, 40, 50 years from now. It's one of those moments in American history. This is an incredible facility.
Representative Debbie Dingell, another dear friend—I know John is looking down, and he's saying, ""We're finally getting it done, huh?"" You're getting it done. Debbie, you're a—and Representative Dan Kildee—he's a good friend. Representative Brenda Lawrence.
And by the way, be careful what you say to Representative Slotkin. She knows more than you; they may be watching you. [Laughter] Where are you? I tease her all the time, and she's a great, great, great addition to the Congress.
And Rashida Tlaib—where's Rashida? I tell you what, Rashida—and I want to say to you that I admire your intellect, I admire your passion, and I admire your concern for so many other people. And it's my—from my heart, I pray that your grandmom and family are well. I promise you, I'm going to do everything to see that they are on the West Bank. You're a fighter. And, God, thank you for being a fighter.
And Andy Levin—I know a lot of Levins. And, Haley Stevens, thank you all as well.
And I also want to thank Mayor Jim [John]* O'Reilly of Dearborn for the passport into the city. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And my buddy, Mike Duggan, he is my mayor. I got—I was sitting one day in the Oval with Barack Obama when President Obama—when I was Vice President. And he looked at me like it was just something off the—he said, ""By the way, I want you to go fix Detroit."" I said: ""Say that again. What am I going to do?""
He said: ""You can get anybody in the Government to go with you. You just do it."" First call I made was this guy. You brought it off its knees; you brought it back. You're a great mayor, and you're a great friend. You've got a lot of courage, Mr. Mayor. Thank you.
And two great friends, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, who couldn't be here today because they're back fighting like hell: fighting for this industry and the people of this State and for labor.
Labor, industry, Federal, State, local leaders all together. That's America at its best. And that's what I so admire about what Bill Ford is doing here. And I—you know, I want to—so everything that these workers, this historic complex, and this State represent is something that I hope gets modeled around the country. It's about respect. It's about dignity, the dignity of work.
My dad used to say, ""Joey""—and I swear to God, when he left Scranton, when the coal died—my dad was not a—he was a salesperson; he wasn't a coal miner. My great-grandpop was, but—he said—he used to say—when he moved to Delaware—he had to leave because there were no jobs, and he left us with our grandpop for a little over a year. And he commuted back and forth from Wilmington, Delaware, to Scranton on the weekends.
And when he got back down to Wilmington, he used to say to all of us—and I was, I guess, then, about—I was—well, I was going into third grade. And he'd say: ""Joey, remember""—I mean this sincerely—""a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community""—I really mean this—""and about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.'""
It's not labor; it's union. Because what you allow people do is hold their heads up, make a decent living, and have pride in what they do: pride in what you build, pride in what you give this Nation.
And I wanted to be here today—the day before you unveil the next generation of America's bestselling vehicle to the entire world—to thank you. Thank you for showing how we win the competition of the 21st century. You know, how the future is going to be made—but it's going to be made here in America: made in America.
And I have to say, this brings me home. For more than 30 years, my dad, when we moved to Delaware, managed automobile dealerships in Delaware, including the Ford dealership. And, man, did I like that '57 Ford Fairlane. [Laughter] Oh, boy, it ain't got nothing on the F-150. But, all kidding aside, that's what got me through school.
And you know, I doubt I'd be—I doubt that it would ever contribute $50 billion—$50 billion—it would support about 500,000 American jobs—that 150—half of the 1 million American jobs Ford supports overall, like the 150 series.
You know, I just got a tour of the groundbreaking electric vehicle center here, along with the UAW workers. And they showed me the technology they're using to build this first-ever fully electric F-150. I was able to sit in it. Quite frankly, I—they let me see it. So I apologize to you at home, won't see it until tomorrow, but, man, you're going to like it. And I'd sure like to drive it. I wonder whether or not I can lose the Secret Service and go out to the track. But—you all think I'm kidding, don't you? [Laughter] The press knows I'm not. [Laughter]
Look, the future of the auto industry is electric. There's no turning back. And as Rory says, ""The American auto industry is at a crossroads."" And the real question is whether we'll lead or we'll fall behind in the race to the future; or whether we'll build these vehicles and the batteries that go in them here in the United States or rely on other countries; or whether the jobs to build these vehicles and batteries, that are good-paying union jobs with benefits, jobs that will sustain and grow the middle class.
Right now China is leading in this race. Make no bones about it; it's a fact. You know, we used to invest more in research and development than any country in the world and China was number eight—or, excuse me, number nine. We now are number eight, and China is number one. Can't let that be sustained. The future is going to be determined by the best minds in the world, by those who break through new barriers.
You know, it has—China—the largest, fastest growing electrical vehicle market in the world, and a key part of an electric vehicle is the battery. Right now 80 percent of the manufacturing capacity of those batteries is done in China, though not the battery for the 150—the F-150. We went down to Georgia and took care of that.
That allows them to corner the market on the supplies of raw materials for those batteries. Important almost—importing almost all the lithium—90 percent—that comes from countries from—like Australia, which lead the world in mining these kinds of critical materials.
And here's the deal: It's not that China's battery technology is that much more innovative than anyone else's. Remember, our national labs in the United States, our universities, our automakers led in the development of this technology.
But today, China has a bigger manufacturing scale than all other countries. And they're using that scale to make these batteries not just in China, but they're making them in Germany and in Mexico. And they're now exporting those electric vehicles around the world, with sights on the American market.
And they think they're going to win. But I've got news for them: They will not win this race. We can't let them. We have to move fast, and that's what you're doing here.
When President Obama and I were in—when Barack and I were in office, that was what we were going to do. Remember 2009? The auto industry was flat on its back. And remember, I got criticized by the press because I was the auto guy, pushing.
Well, guess what? We were told that we'd never be able to sell American-made cars at the same rate as before. But we didn't listen. We bet on you, the American auto worker. We extended a lifeline, and we stepped up, saved more than a million jobs. Working with the auto industry, we set fuel-efficiency standards and provided incentives for folks to buy fuel-efficient vehicles.
And through the Recovery Act, we made the largest investment in clean energy and battery technology ever. And the Big Three emerged from the crisis in a position to sell millions of vehicles made right here in the U.S.A.
But then, the previous administration came into office. They rolled back the standards we set, rollbacks that the Ford Motor Company opposed. Despite bipartisan support for consumer incentives, they let the Federal tax credit expire, penalizing auto workers who were selling the most electric vehicles at the time.
They announced infrastructure week, and they announced it and announced it and announced it and announced it every week for 4 years and didn't do a damn thing. They didn't get the job done.
Folks, the rest of the world is moving fast. They're moving ahead. They're not waiting for the United States of America. Government, labor, industry—working together—have to step up. And we have a playbook that will work.
We're going to set a new pace for electric vehicles. That means reversing the previous administration's short-sighted rollback of vehicle emissions and efficiency standards, setting strong, clear targets where we need to go.
It means passing the American Jobs Plan to do three things. One, transform our infrastructure. Our infrastructure is ranked like 38 in the world. This is the United States of America, for God's sake.
We're going to put Americans to work modernizing our roads, our highways, our ports, our airports, rails, and transit systems. That includes putting IBEW members and the union workers to work installing 500,000 charging stations along our roads and highways, our homes and our apartments. The IBEW is ready to do it, and they can.
Two, we're going to boost our manufacturing capacity. That's why the American Jobs Plan invests in new and retooled union facilities: grants to kickstart new battery and parts production, loans and tax credits to boost manufacturing of these clean vehicles.
It also makes the largest investment in research and development in generations. That's going to help innovate, manufacture, and build the supply chains for batteries and semiconductors and the small computer chips that make electric trucks and cars go—to be even more reliant than they are now. It matters. The little things matter.
We saw, last night, the United States Senate voted overwhelmingly to begin work on part of the bill that I've been pushing to strengthen our innovation in infrastructure by investing in research and development and manufacturing. I don't remember the exact number, but it was pretty high. I think it was 83 to something in a bipartisan vote. That's a good first step.
And your Members of Congress here in Michigan, they know the value of manufacturing as well as anyone and are vital in pushing forward that bill and others. Never again should we be in the situation we face today with semiconductor shortages: The United States—we can't manufacture semiconductors. We were the beginning.
You know, I think some people think I'm too proud of what the United States always did and why I get so frustrated when we're sliding. But I make no apologies for it. We know these kinds of Federal investments work.
It was the Defense Department and NASA that got the modern semiconductor industry on its feet decades ago. We started it. Your tax dollars. Our own Department of Energy pioneered and transformed the battery industry when Barack and I were in office.
And through the Recovery Act grants and loans, battery prices dropped 80 percent—80 percent—because we were looking forward. We need that same mindset today. We have to look forward. And you know, we have to work to support consumers and these fleets.
That means new purchasing incentives for consumers to buy clean vehicles like the electric Ford 150—a union-made product—right here in America. But all the pieces must be made in America. It means spurring demand by converting the Federal Government's enormous fleet of vehicles into clean vehicles and supporting electric transit systems and school buses.
Folks, when I got elected, I signed an Executive order saying we're going to buy American. As President, I get to award contracts in the area of 600 to 700 billion dollars a year, from building aircraft carriers to railings that go in buildings. Guess what? And Representative Kildee knows: I'm not letting a single contract to a single company that does not hire Americans, have all American parts, and has a supply chain that is an American product supply chain.
And by the way, that's not violating any trade agreement. It's been the law since the thirties, but no one has had the courage or the nerve to insist on it being applied. It's no violation of the World Trade Organization or anything else. If we're spending American tax dollars, we're able to say, ""Buy American.""
But there's a lot of exceptions in the law. If you don't have the part immediately available in the supply chain, you can go abroad and get it. And anyone in the agency can say: ""I can't find it here. I'm going somewhere."" Not anymore. They've got to go through the White House. Not a joke. Nobody can give that exception now. Because there's thousands of companies out there that are able to do—small companies—3, 4, 10, 15 people—who can supply those pieces if they know they can compete for them.
My brother has an expression—a guy named Pete McLaughlin, who was a great basketball player, played for Providence—was a good, close friend. He'd say, ""Joe, you've got to know how to know."" You've got to know how to know. We don't let the American companies know what's available to them, especially if they're small. So we're going to have a—we have an office and a facility in the White House to let people know what's needed.
And there is another thing we have in our playbook that's going to outcompete other nations, the biggest secret we have: the American worker. Not a joke. They're the finest workforce in the world. It's our ace in that deck.
Now, I know many of you watching at home are like the folks I grew up with in Scranton and in Claymont, Delaware. They feel left out, left behind in an economy and an industry that's rapidly changing. I understand it. I really do. But we will leave no one behind.
Nearly 90 percent of the jobs created in my American Jobs Plan do not require a bachelor's degree; 75 percent don't require a associate's degree. We're going to be working with companies and community colleges and technical schools and union-led apprentice and training programs to make sure that American workers will be prepared to compete with anyone in the world, just like Ford does with its workforce training center here in Dearborn.
And when we invest in our infrastructure, we're going to buy American products, materials, services from American businesses: Made in America. And we'll do everything in our power to encourage and protect the right of workers to unionize and collectively bargain.
I met with, I think it was more than a dozen CEOs of the major Fortune 500 companies. We started off, and I said, ""I want to be clear with you: I'm a union guy."" And every one of them but one said, ""I understand."" Because now they're realizing what Mr. Ford realizes: that you are the best workers available. You're the best trained. You're the most capable. And you save overall.
Bottom line: The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America—a blue-collar blueprint to build America. And we need automakers and other companies to keep investing here in America and not take the benefits of our public investments and expand electric vehicles and battery manufacturing production abroad.
We need you to deepen your partnership with the UAW, pay good wages, and support communities like Dearborn across the country. We need to come together as a nation.
The Vice President and I have had a number of meetings in the Oval Office with Republican leaders in Congress and Members of Congress. We believe we can find a bipartisan deal on infrastructure. And we look forward to hearing more details of their proposal, which they're going to submit a counterproposal either later today or tomorrow to me.
But we've made one thing clear: We'll compromise, but doing nothing is not an option. Doing nothing is not an option. The world is not waiting, I say for a second time.
I'll conclude with this: Last month, I kept my commitment to convene the leaders of the major economies around the world from Russia, China, India, Japan, the European Union. I convened them all. I think there were 48 or 50 heads of state—Presidents and Prime Ministers—a meeting I hosted, by the White House, on one of the most consequential issues facing the world: the climate crisis.
And I made it clear at the outset, as each of they—these folks came on, what I've long believed: When I think of the climate crisis—beyond its devastation to lives and livelihoods and the health of our very planet—I think ""jobs."" I think jobs when I think climate change, good-paying union jobs. I think about the UAW workers here today.
I wanted to make sure that the world could see that there was a consensus that we are at an inflection point in our history, and almost every major leader in the world spoke to it. If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of good-paying jobs, generate significant economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for people not only here, but around the world.
But I also wanted to put the world on notice: America is back. America is back. In the competition for the 21st century, the future will be built right here in America. Look at this plant. We're moving. We're working again. We're dreaming again. We're discovering again. We're leading the world again.
We have shown each other and the world that there's no quit in America. There's simply no quit in America. And that's never, ever—it's—every time I have these, sometimes knock-down, drag-them-outs with heads of state in private—they'll say something, and I'll say: ""Look, it's never been a good bet to bet against America. Never, never, never.""
This is the United States of America. There's not a single thing—and I believe this with every fiber in me—that not a single thing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together. And that's exactly what we're about to do, starting with all of you.
And thank you for allowing me to be here. May God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 1:51 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to Angela Powell, forklift operator, at Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, who introduced the President; Rory Gamble, president, United Auto Workers; William C.

* White House correction.","Joseph R. Biden, Remarks at the Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/350000 ",,,,,,,,,,,
17-May-21,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon. There are three things I want to speak briefly today with you all about: the new milestone in our progress against COVID-19 here at home, steps we're taking to fight COVID internationally, and an important tax cut for families with children under the age of 18. And that's where I'm going to start.
Today is tax day, when everyone's taxes are due. No one likes to pay taxes, I know. But as my dad used to say, ""It's a small price to live in this country."" But I want to tell everyone with children why, as they are filling their taxes today—filing their taxes today, they should know that a new tax cut will be coming their way for working class and middle class folks and very soon.
As everyone knows, I firmly believe—we firmly believe—the need to make our tax system work for the middle class. That's why I think we should ask corporations and the top 1 percent to start paying their fair share and why we should crack down on millionaires and billionaires who escape taxes by cheating.
But I also think we need to give ordinary families a break—a tax break—to help them with the cost of raising their kids. Most people don't know it, but for families with children, we put that tax cut into the American Rescue Plan, which was signed not long ago. And I signed the tax cut into law in March.
Ninety percent of families—all middle class and working class families—will get this tax cut. It's a 1-year tax cut that reduces your taxes by $3,000 a year for each child you have under the age of 18. Two kids: It's a $6,000 tax cut. And if those kids are under the age of 6, you'll actually get $3,600 per child. So, as you file your taxes today, know that your tax cut is coming.
But this—but here's the great news: You won't have to wait until your next year's tax return to get that break. I'm announcing today that on July 15 and the 15th of every month thereafter throughout the year, you will get, deposited into your bank account, half of your tax cut—at least $250 per child each month—a direct deposit into your account.
So if you're a working family with two kids, you're going to get $500 a month into your bank account on the 15th of every month, starting July. We're getting—and we are getting you a tax cut this year—now, when you need it—and not have to wait. And if you get your tax cut refund deposited in your bank account automatically, this tax cut will be put into your account automatically. If not, it will be mailed to you.
In addition to helping Americans hard-pressed and working families, experts have told us that this will cut child poverty in America in half. This tax cut sends a clear and powerful message to American working families with children: Help is here.
Now let me take—talk to another milestone in our long battle with COVID. Today, for the first time since the pandemic began, cases—pandemic cases are down in all 50 States. First time. That's right: Thanks a lot to the hard work of so many people, COVID cases are down in all 50 States.
Now, I can't promise that will continue this way. We know there will be advances and setbacks, and we know that there are many flareups that could occur. But if the unvaccinated get vaccinated, they will protect themselves and other unvaccinated people around them. If they do not, States with low vaccination rates may see those rates go up, may see this progress reversed.
Ultimately, those who are not vaccinated will pay—will end up paying the price. The vaccinated will continue to be protected against severe illnesses, but others may not be if you're not vaccinated. But given that the vaccination is convenient and free, it will be a tragedy if—and a needless one—to see COVID cases among those who do not get vaccinated go up.
We are not done fighting this virus. We still have tens of millions left to vaccinate. But we are making significant progress. In fact, when tomorrow's vaccination numbers come out, they'll show that 60 percent—60 percent—of Americans have received at least one shot.
Every day, the light at the end of that tunnel is growing brighter. This vaccination effort has been an historic logistical achievement for our Nation. And I want to thank the scientists and the researchers; the companies manufacturing the vaccines; the National Guard; the U.S. military; FEMA; the Nation's Governors; doctors, nurses, pharmacists. And I want to thank the American people who have stepped up and done their patriotic duty and gotten vaccinated.
In less than 4 months, we've gone from less than 6 percent to 60 percent of adults in America with at least one shot. We're seeing the results in live—and we've seen the results in people's lives and in their livelihoods. Deaths are down from COVID by 81 percent and also at their lowest levels since April of 2020.
As a result of our prompt action to roll out the vaccine and boost the economy, we've gone from stagnation to an economy that is growing faster than it has in nearly 40 years. We've gone from anemic job creation to a record of creation for more—for a new administration. None has ever created this many jobs in this timeframe.
The progress is undeniable, but we're not done yet. And some of the hardest work is ahead. We're still losing too many Americans and we still have too many unvaccinated people in America. Last week, the CDC announced that if you're fully vaccinated, you no longer have to wear a mask. They reported that science—the science now shows that your vaccination protects you as well as being masked or better than being masked. So you can protect yourself from serious illness from COVID by getting vaccinated or wearing a mask until you are fully vaccinated. Either way, you're protected.
As I said last week, some people may want to continue to wear a mask even if they are fully vaccinated. That's a decision they can make. Some businesses may want to continue to require wearing masks. Let's all be kind and respectful to one another as we come out of this pandemic and respect those who want to continue to wear a mask even if they've been vaccinated.
Above all, let's work together, though, to meet the target I've set of 70 percent of adults—all adults—with at least one shot by July the 4th. Seven States have already done this. Getting vaccinated has never been easier. We are at 80,000 locations where you can get a shot. Ninety percent of you live within 5 miles of one of those locations.
You can now find a vaccine site near you by texting your ZIP Code to 438829—438829. Your ZIP Code and that number. You'll get all the places near you. Many places don't require an appointment. Just walk in and get the shot. It's free, and everyone 12 years and above is eligible.
If you need help getting your vaccine site—getting to or from your vaccination site, Lyft and Uber are offering free rides between—to take you to the vaccination site and bring you back home between May 24 of—and July the 4th to anyone who wants to get vaccinated.
And I have called on employers to do their part as well, offering their employees paid time off to get vaccinated. And we've set up a program nationally to reimburse those businesses for the cost of giving employees the time off.
Now it's time to get your shot. We have the vaccine. We've secured enough supply to vaccinate all adults and children above the age of 12. I repeat: Now is the time to get your vaccine shot.
Now, over the past 118 days, our vaccinations program has led the world. And today we're taking an additional step to help the world. We know America will never be fully safe until the pandemic that is raging globally is under control. No ocean is wide enough, no wall is high enough, to keep us safe.
Rampant disease and death in other countries can destabilize them—those countries—and pose a risk to us as well. New variants could arise overseas that could put us at greater risk. And we need to help fight the disease around the world to keep us safe here at home and to do the right thing of helping other people. It's the right thing to do. It's the smart thing to do. It's the strong thing to do.
In March, we shared over 4 million doses of our AstraZeneca vaccine with Canada and Mexico. At the end of April, we announced that we would provide another 60 million doses of our AstraZeneca vaccine overseas.
Remember, this is the vaccine that's not authorized for use in the United States yet, so we're going to be sending it to folks once the FDA has reviewed this and said it's safe. This is all the AstraVeneca [AstraZeneca]* vaccine produced in the United States—all of it will be sent to other countries.
And today I'm announcing that we'll also share U.S.-authorized vaccines doses of Pfizer and Moderna and Johnson and Johnson, as they become available, with the rest of the world as well. These are vaccinations and vaccines that are authorized to be put in arms of Americans.
And by the end of June, when we'll have taken delivery of enough of such vaccines to protect everyone in the United States, the United States will share at least 20 million doses of those doses—that extra supply—with other countries.
This means, over the next 6 weeks, the United States of America will send 80 million doses overseas. That represents 13 percent of the vaccines produced by the United States by the end of June. This will be more vaccines than any country has actually shared to date—five times more than any other country—more than Russia and China, which have donated 15 million doses.
You know, there's a lot of talk about Russia and China influencing the world with vaccines. We want to lead the world with our values, with this demonstration of our innovation, ingenuity, and the fundamental decency of the American people.
Just as in World War II America was the arsenal of democracy, in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, our Nation is going to be the arsenal of vaccines for the rest of the world. We'll share these vaccines in the service of ending the pandemic everywhere. And we will not use our vaccines to secure favors from other countries. We will work with COVAX—the international organization set up—and other partners to ensure that the vaccines are delivered in a way that is equitable and that follows the science and the public health data.
Today's announcement to share 80 million doses is our next step as we ramp up the efforts to respond to COVID-19 around the world. In the weeks ahead, working the world—with the world's democracies, we'll coordinate a multilateral effort to end this pandemic. I expect to announce progress in this area at the G-7 summit in the United Kingdom in June, which I plan on attending.
This is a unique moment in history, and it requires American leadership. But I want to be clear: Beating this pandemic globally is beyond the capacity of any one nation, even the United States. But we'll continue—the United States will continue—to donate our excess supply as that supply is delivered to us, but that won't be nearly enough.
We need—what we need to do is lead an entirely new effort—an effort that involves working with the pharmaceutical companies and others and partner nations to vastly increase supply, to create, particular—practically—most of it here in the United States—the kind of capacity that can beat this pandemic worldwide in a way that creates jobs here at home and saves lives abroad.
This will take longer than our immediate work to donate from the existing supplies. And we're going to be asking other nations to help shoulder the economic costs of this effort, but the consequences will be more lasting and more dramatic. Doing this will help us beat the pandemic and leave us with the manufacturing capacity here to prepare for the next crisis, the next vaccine needed.
I'm putting Jeff Zients, who is leading our COVID team and the COVID efforts to beat the virus here in the United States, in charge of this effort. Jeff will be working with our National Security Council and a talented, dedicated team that has been stood up all across our Government. It will include Gayle Smith at the State Department leading in diplomacy and experts from our Agency for International Development and the Department of Health and Human Services as well. We're going to bring the same whole-of-Government response to the global effort that made us so successful here at home.
Again, we have enough—we have secured—we, the United States, has secured enough supply for all eligible Americans—all Americans, 12 years old and older. And we still have work to do though, hard work. But because we have done so much here, because of the power of American companies, research, and manufacturing, we can continue to do more to help the rest of the world. This is a rapidly changing world, and it's a mistake to bet against democracies.
Just as democracies led the world in the darkness of World War II, democracies will lead the world out of this pandemic. And America will lead those democracies, as they work to bring greater health and hope to the world in the months to come.
And, folks, think back: Four months ago—4 months ago—it was an audacious goal that we had to put a million shots in the arms in my first 100 days as President—100 million, I should say. We did over 220 million shots in that timeframe. Back then, most adults weren't eligible to get the shot. Now everyone 12 years and older is eligible. And tomorrow 60 percent—by tomorrow, 60 percent of all American adults will have received at least one shot.
Look at what we've done. Look at what we've done, America. Look at what you've done, America. There is not a single thing beyond our capacity to do in this country when we decide to do it and we do it together. We can do whatever we set our minds to do if we do it together. And that's exactly what we're going to do: solve the problem here in the United States, which we're well on our way of doing, and help solve the problem for the world by organizing the rest of the democracies of the world.
I want to thank you all. God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you very much.

* White House correction.","Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/349987 ",,,,,,,,,,,
13-May-21,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Well, today is a great day for America in our long battle with the coronavirus. Just a few hours ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—announced that they are no longer recommending that fully vaccinated people need wear masks. This recommendation holds true whether you are inside or outside.
I think it's a great milestone. A great day. It's been made possible by the extraordinary success we've had in vaccinating so many Americans so quickly.
To date, we have given out 250 million shots in 114 days, and we're seeing the results. Cases are down in 49 of 50 States. The New York Times has reported that hospitalizations are the lowest they've been since April of 2020, over a year ago, right after the start of the pandemic. Deaths are down 80 percent and also at their lowest levels since April of 2020.
And as the virus tragically rages in other countries, as other nations—even wealthy nations—are mired in the challenges of a slow vaccine rollout and poor economic conditions as a result, things are very different here. In less than 4 months, we've gone from 5.5 percent to nearly 60 percent of the adults in America with at least one shot in their arm. We've gone from stagnation to an economy that is growing faster than it has in nearly 40 years. We've gone from an anemic job creation to a record for job creation for a new administration.
All of this is the product of prompt action to roll out the vaccine and boost our economy. As I said in my joint address to the Congress, this vaccination effort has been a historic logistical achievement for the United States of America.
Over these past 114 days, our vaccination program has led the world. And that's due to the incredible hard work of so many people: the scientists and researchers; the drug companies; the National Guard; the U.S. military; FEMA; the Nation's Governors, doctors, nurses, pharmacists—everyone who has moved Heaven and Earth to get as many shots into arms of as many Americans as possible. And it's truly been an all-hands-on deck—for the country—effort.
You know, some people said we couldn't do this—that it would not be until the fall that we had this many people vaccinated; that 2021 might be a lost year for our country, as 2020 was. But we proved the doubters wrong.
I need to single out one more group to praise: the American people. The American people. For more than a year, you've endured so much and so many lost jobs, so many businesses lost, so many lives upended, and so many months that our kids couldn't be in school. You couldn't see your friends or family. All the moments that mattered so much—from birthdays to weddings to graduations—all postponed.
And most tragically of all: the lost lives. As the press here knows, I carry a card in my pocket with the number of lives lost to COVID as of the close of business yesterday: 580,073 lost lives. So many empty chairs. So many times a husband or a wife leaned over to touch their spouse, and they're not there. Moms and dads, sons and daughters, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, grandparents, your neighbors, your coworkers.
Having been there in other circumstances, I know it's of little solace right now, but I promise you: The day will come when the memory of the loved one you lost will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. That's when you know you're going to get through it. You will get through it. But it's a long haul.
You've endured all this. When your country asked you to get vaccinated, you did. The American people stepped up. You did what I consider to be your patriotic duty. That's how we've gotten to this day.
As President, I can say I'm pleased, but—I'm sure the Vice President agrees with me—we're not surprised. Pleased, but not surprised. Because the simple truth is this: the American people have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down. Never.
This country is proving what we've known—what we've all known for so long. There's nothing we are unable to do when we put our minds, our hearts, and our souls into it, and we do it together.
Now, I want to be clear about what the CDC is saying and what the CDC is not saying. The CDC is saying they have concluded that fully vaccinated people are at a very, very low risk of getting COVID-19. Therefore, if you've been fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask. Let me repeat: If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask.
But if you've not been vaccinated, or if you're getting a two-shot vaccine, and you've not gotten your—you've only had your first shot but not your second or you haven't waited the full 2 weeks after your second shot, you still need to wear a mask.
Look, we've gotten this far; please protect yourself until you get to the finish line. Because as great as this announcement is today, we don't want to let up. We all know how tough this virus has been. The safest thing for the country is for everyone to get vaccinated.
And getting vaccinated is easier than ever. We've worked so hard. We have 80,000 locations. Ninety percent of you live within 5 miles of one of those locations.
And you can find a vaccine site near you by texting your ZIP Code to the following number: 438829. Let me repeat: Text your ZIP Code to 438829. And it will get the place nearest to you; you can go and get vaccinated now. And many places don't require an appointment. It's free. Just walk in, get the shot. Anyone 12 years or above in age is eligible.
And for now, after a year of hard work and so much sacrifice, the rule is very simple: Get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do. It's vax'ed or masked. Get vaccinated. If you're vaccinated, you can be around the vaccinated or unvaccinated people. But if you're not vaccinated or not fully vaccinated, you should wear a mask for your own protection and the protection of other unvaccinated people. The choice is yours.
You all made this possible. Now let's finish the work of beating this virus and getting everything back to normal. Remember, as fast as we've gone, most people under the age of 65 aren't vaccinated yet. We've opened vaccinations nationally to all adults just 4 weeks ago. It's going to take a little more time for everyone who wants to get vaccinated to get their shots. So, all of us, let's be patient. Be patient with one another.
You know, some may say, ""I just feel more comfortable continuing to wear a mask."" They may feel that way. So if you're someone with a mask—you see them, please treat them with kindness and respect. We've had too much conflict, too much bitterness, too much anger, too much politicization of this issue about wearing masks. Let's put it to rest.
Let's remember, we're all Americans. Let's remember that we are all in this together. If you're fully vaccinated and can take your mask off, you've earned the right to do something that Americans are known for all around the world: greeting others with a smile—with a smile.
So it's a good day for the country. We aren't done yet. We're still losing too many Americans because we still have too many unvaccinated people. We have to get to 70 percent of adults started on vaccinations by July the 4th. And we have to take this pandemic, tackle it not just here, but overseas as well, to truly be safe in the long run.
There's still more work ahead. But I've said many times: As tough as this pandemic has been, we will get through it. We will rebuild our economy, reclaim our lives, and get back to normal. We'll laugh again. We'll know joy again. And we'll smile again, you know, and now see one another's smile, look at the smiles on other people's faces. Better days are ahead, I promise you.
And the best days for America are still to come. I promise you that as well.
Thank you, God bless you, and remember: It's never, ever, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against the American people. Thank you.
Coronavirus Prevention Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, how do you enforce unvaccinated Americans to still use their masks?
The President. I don't—we don't enforce it. We, in fact, if you don't—if you haven't been vaccinated, wear your mask for your own protection and the protection of the people who are—also have not been vaccinated yet.
It's not an enforcement thing. We're not going to go out and arrest people. But the fact of the matter is, I still believe the vast majority of the American people care about the safety of their neighbors and care about the safety of their families.
And, like I said: If you've been vaccinated, you don't have to wear your mask and you can shake hands. You can even give each other a hug. But if you've not been vaccinated, please wear the mask. Please wear the mask.
Thank you.
The President's Meeting With Republican Senators/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, is there any update on your meeting with the Republicans, sir?
The President. We had a very, very good meeting. It was great to be back with so many of the colleagues that I had served with in the Senate, and I am very optimistic that we can reach a reasonable agreement. But even if we don't, it's been a good-faith—there's a good-faith effort that's been started.
Q. Did you compromise on anything other than the corporate tax?
The President. We didn't compromise on anything. What we did was, I laid out what I thought we should be doing, how it should be paid for. And my colleagues in the Senate came back and said they'll come back to me with a counteroffer of what they are prepared to do and fund and how to fund it, and then we'll talk again next week.
So thank you all so very much.","NOTE: The President spoke at 3:58 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Sens. Shelley Moore Capito, John A. Barrasso III, Roy D.

13-May-21,Remarks Prior to Meeting With Republican Senators on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Well, you in the press may be getting tired of seeing me all day today. I'm going to see you again later too. But I hope my colleagues aren't tired of seeing me; they just got here. [Laughter]
Look, what we're doing is—at the request of—mutual request of us getting together, getting leading Republicans in the Senate together—to see if we can work out something on a compromise on infrastructure. And I know they're sincere about it, and so am I.
And what we're going to try to do is figure out what we can agree constitutes infrastructure from each of our perspectives and then see whether or not we're in a position that—how much we want to fund it above the baseline, the baseline, meaning what we spent last year. And then, we'll talk about how to proceed from there.
But I assure you—I know, Senator Capito, this is in good faith——
Senator Shelley Moore Capito. Yes.
The President. It's a genuine effort. I think we can get there. And I'm hoping that—just in case, I brought along two of the Secretaries—[laughter]—who are smarter than I am so they can answer the really tough questions.
But all kidding aside, I'm looking forward to this meeting.
And I want to thank you all for coming in, and we appreciate you being here. So thank you for being here.
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation

13-May-21,Remarks on the Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Hello, folks. I want to update everyone on the ransomware cyber attack that impacted on the Colonial Pipeline over this past week.
As of yesterday evening, Colonial has begun restarting the flow of refined products in their pipeline. This morning Colonial reported that fuel is beginning to flow to a majority of the markets that they service, and they should be reaching full operational capacity as we speak—as I speak to you right now.
That is good news. But I want to be clear: We'll not feel the effects at the pump immediately. This is not like flicking on a light switch. This pipeline is 5,500 miles long. It had never been fully shut down in its entire history and so fully. And we have to—now they have to safely and fully return to normal operations. And it's going to take some time, and there may be some hiccups, like I just had, along the way here. [Laughter]
Still, we expect to see a region-by-region return to normalcy beginning this weekend and continuing into next week. In the meantime, I want to update you on what our administration is doing to accelerate this process, to mitigate shortages, and to protect you from price gouging—to protect the American people from price gouging—all those along the line.
First, we relaxed rules for pipeline operators to provide flexibility for emergency personnel to help manually get portions of the pipeline up and running earlier this week. Secondly, over the weekend, we reviewed and worked with the company to get a portion of the pipeline system from North Carolina to Maryland to operate under manual control and deliver its existing inventory.
In addition, we've put in place emergency orders that lifts hours—the hours restrictions and allowed States to lift weight restrictions for tank truck drivers to be on the road. This allows those drivers to work more and carry more fuel to the affected regions.
Third, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a targeted, 20-day waiver of standards in several States to give fuel suppliers more flexibility to use available fuels where they're needed, which will boost the fuel supply.
And those last two actions have made tens of millions of gallons of additional fuel available each day to be able to be distributed. Put another way: The extraordinary measures the administration has taken, we estimate, sent enough gas to stations to fill the tanks of over 5 million vehicles in the last few days.
Fourthly, as part of an effort to use every possible means to accelerate fuel deliveries, last night I granted a waiver of the Jones Act to fuel suppliers. This allows non-U.S. flagged vessels to transport refined fuel products from the Gulf of Mexico to affected areas. And we'll grant additional waivers if necessary. These steps are temporary, but they will remain in place until full service is fully restored. This is a whole-of-Government response to get more fuel more quickly to where it's needed and to limit the pain being felt by American customers.
Now, here is what drives—the driver in the States that are affected, here's what they—you can do, the drivers: Don't panic, number one. I know seeing lines at the pumps or gas stations with no gas can be extremely stressful, but this is a temporary situation. Do not get more gas than you need in the next few days. As I said, we expect the situation to begin to improve by the weekend and into early next week. And gasoline supply is coming back on line, and panic buying will only slow the process.
And I also want to say something to the gas stations: Do not—I repeat, do not—try to take advantage of consumers during this time. I'm going to work with Governors in the affected States to put a stop to price gouging wherever it arises. And I am asking our Federal agencies to stand ready to provide assistance to State-level efforts to monitor and address any price gouging at the pump.
Nobody should be using this situation for financial gain. That's what the hackers are trying to do. That's what they were about, not us. That's not who we are.
And as for the people who carried out this attack, the FBI has released details on the attack so others can take steps to prevent being victimized like Colonial has been. We do not believe—I emphasize, we do not believe—the Russian Government was involved in this attack. But we do have strong reason to believe that the criminals who did the attack are living in Russia—that's where it came from—were from Russia.
We have been in direct communication with Moscow about the imperative for responsible countries to take decisive action against these ransomware networks. And we're also going to pursue a measure to disrupt their ability to operate. And our Justice Department has launched a new Task Force dedicated to prosecuting ransomware hackers to the full extent of the law.
And finally, let me say that this event is providing an urgent reminder of why we need to harden our infrastructure and make it more resilient against all threats, natural and manmade.
My administration is continuing to safeguard our critical infrastructure, the majority of which is privately owned and managed, like Colonial Pipeline. Private entities are in charge of their own cybersecurity, and we need—and we have to—we know what they need. They need greater private-sector investment in cybersecurity. And that's why we launched a new public-private initiative in April that is focusing on strengthening cybersecurity in the electric sector for natural gas, for pipelines, as well as water systems and other lifeline sectors.
And last night I signed an Executive order to improve the Nation's cybersecurity. It calls for Federal agencies to work more closely with the private sector to share information, strengthen cybersecurity practices, and deploy technologies that increase reliance against cyber attacks.
It outlines innovative ways the Government will drive to deliver security and software, using Federal buying power to jumpstart the market and improve the products that all Americans use.
To assist in this urgent work of protecting our Nation's—our Nation against cyber attacks, I'm calling on the United States Senate to move quickly to confirm Chris Inglis as our National Cyber Director and Jen Easterly to be the Director of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security.
In America, we've seen critical infrastructure taken off line by floods, fires, storms and criminal hackers. In Texas, last month, we saw what happens when storms hit power systems that aren't fully modernized or ready for the threats of extreme weather, with tragic results.
Now we're seeing the effect of criminal hackers with gas lines throughout the Southwest—excuse me, the Southeast. And we're in a competition with China and the rest of the world to win the 21st century, economically. And we're not going to win it competing with an infrastructure that is out of the 20th century. We need a modern infrastructure.
My American Jobs Plan includes transformative investments in modernizing and in securing our critical infrastructure. Later this afternoon I'll be meeting with Republican Senators to discuss ways we can move forward on modernizing the infrastructure we have today and building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. I'm willing to negotiate, as I indicated yesterday to the House Members and to the leadership. But it's clearer than ever that doing nothing is not an option.
Again, we expect things to return to normal over the next several days. I will be monitoring Colonial's progress and the Federal Government's support every step of the way.
So stay strong. Help is on the way. We're going to get through this as we always do, as Americans, and we're going to do it together. And it's going to be quick.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Q. Mr. President, if I may—[inaudible]——
Cyber Criminals/Russia/President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. Mr. President, you said that the hackers are believed to be living in Russia. At what point does the U.S. start to try to inflict pain on governments who allow this sort of this to happen in their territory?
The President. We are working to try to get to the place where we have sort of an international standard, that governments knowing that criminal activities are happening from their territory, that we all move on those criminal enterprises. And that I—I expect that's one of the topics I'll be talking about with President Putin.
Q. Mr. President, when does the Executive——
Ransomware Attack on Colonial Pipeline 
Q. Are you confident that Putin was not involved? Are you confident that Putin was not involved?
The President. I am confident that I read the report of the FBI accurately, and they say they were not—he was not, the Government was not.
Q. What would you like to do——
Cybersecurity in the Private Sector/Federal Government Oversight 
Q. Mr. President, Wednesday's Executive order mentions the Colonial Pipeline directly, but the press release says it only encourages private-sector companies to follow the Federal Government's lead, which—encouragement is good, but in the face of profit, it's kind of sketchy. So what concrete steps is the administration taking to ensure that companies are prepared and held accountable for their cyber issues—cybersecurity issues?
The President. You've asked three different questions in that one thing—[laughter]—I think, as I understand it.
The bottom line is that I cannot dictate that the private companies do certain things relative to cybersecurity. A lot of you are very seasoned reporters; you've been covering this debate up on the Capitol Hill for—before I became President—and, unrelated to President Trump, just a debate internally among Senators as to whether or not the Government should be assisting. And it gets into privacy issues and a whole range of things.
So that's going to be an ongoing negotiation. But I think it's becoming clear to everyone that we have to do more than is being done now, and the Federal Government can be significant value added in having that happen.
Yes.
Potential U.S. Countermeasures 
Q. Are you confident—will you consider doing any kind of retaliatory cyber attacks to shut down these criminals? Are you ruling that out?
The President. No.
Israel/Rocket Attacks From Gaza/International Diplomatic Efforts 
Q. Is Prime Minister Netanyahu doing enough to stop this violence there from escalating?
The President. I had a brief conversation with him yesterday. And I have my intelligence community, the Defense Department, as well as the State Department have been in contact with all of their counterparts in—not only in Israel, but in the region.
And one of the things that I have seen thus far is that there has not been a significant overreaction. The question is how we get to a point where—they get to a point where there is a significant reduction in the attacks, particularly the rocket attacks that are indiscriminately fired into population centers.
But I expect I'll be having some more discussions. And it wasn't—we haven't just spoken with the Israelis; it was the Egyptians, the Saudis, and others. So we're—it's a work in progress right now.
So thank you all so very much.
Ransomware Attack on Colonial Pipeline 
Q. One more, Mr. President? Would you take just one more on the ransom? Were you briefed on the fact that the company did pay the ransom?
The President. I have no comment on that. Thank you.
Q. Thank you.

12-May-21,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon again. Tomorrow we'll cross 250 million vaccine shots administered since I took office. I think it's a pretty consequential achievement for the Nation.
I promised I'd keep you up to date every 50 million shots. Today I have an important update. Last week, I launched a new phase of our vaccination program. At that time, I set two new goals for our country. The first was getting 70 percent of adults their first shot by July the 4th. The second was having 160 million Americans of all ages fully vaccinated by that same date.
I'm pleased to report we've made strong progress on the adult vaccination efforts in just the past few days by making it easier than ever to get vaccinated. You can visit vaccine.gov or text your ZIP Code to 438829 to find a vaccination site near you. And we're also—opened up thousands of federal pharmacy sites to vaccinations without an appointment so people can just walk up and get the shot.
Now, more employers than ever are giving people time off as well to get their shots. More grocery and retail stores and sports teams are providing discounts and promotions to encourage customers and fans to get vaccinated.
I was—talked to a bunch of Governors yesterday. One of—the Governor of Maine—points out that if you're a hunter or a fisherman in Maine, and you want to get a license, no problem, you don't have to pay for it if you get your vaccination shot at the same time you get your license. The whole point is: There's a lot more convenient places for people to get their vaccine shot.
From May 24 to July 4, Uber and Lyft—and I think it's incredibly generous of them—are going to offer everyone in America free rides to and from vaccination sites. So go online, find out where the vaccination site is, call Uber or Lyft, they will take you there, wait for you, and take you back.
As a result, even though more than half of the adults in the country have already gotten their first shot, we have fewer people who need to be vaccinated than ever before, and we're actually—actually—seeing a slight increase in the pace of vaccinations across the past week. And we're now on track to hit 60 percent of adults with at least one shot by next week.
We still have a lot of work to do to get the adult vaccination rate up to 70 percent, but I believe we're going to get there. So today I want to talk about an exciting new development. When I spoke last week, I said that we were hoping to soon add a new element to our vaccination program: vaccinations for adolescents ages 12 and older.
And then, on Monday, after a rigorous, thorough review, the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, authorized Pfizer vaccine for use in that age category: 12 and up. Today an independent advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—voted to recommend its use. Now pending the CDC's final approval later today, we're going to have, for the first time, a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents over the 12 years of age. And this is one more giant step in our fight against the pandemic.
I sincerely think the scientists, researchers, and clinical trial participants deserve our thanks; they've all made this possible. Because of them, nearly 17 million more Americans are eligible to get vaccinated and now—now.
I encourage each of them and their parents to get their vaccination shots right away. And here's why: We know that kids at this age, 12 and above, are at risk from COVID-19. About 3 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in kids under 17 years of age. And teenagers can spread it to their friends, to their siblings, to their parents, and to their grandparents. Now that vaccine is authorized for ages 12 and up, and I encourage their parents to make sure they get the shot.
As I promised last week, we're ready. This new population is going to find the vaccine rollout fast and efficient. As of tomorrow, more than 15,000 pharmacies across this country will be ready to vaccinate this age group. Most of these pharmacies are close to a family—as their family home as the kid's school is to their family home.
We're also going to be getting vaccines to pharmacy—for—to pediatricians and family doctors so parents and children can talk to their doctors who they trust about getting the vaccination. And they'll be able to do it at that office. We're also partnering with school-based clinics and community health centers. Of course, we remain focused on equity in our vaccine program. The vaccine is free for everyone—free.
Additionally, if teens are on the move this summer, they can get their first shot in one place and the second shot elsewhere. At the same time, we're also launching an important public education campaign. First and foremost, we're providing families with trusted medical information they need to make informed decisions about the vaccination and the vaccine.
Our medical and scientific experts at CDC and the National Institutes of Health will be out there in the public every day to answer questions and get the facts out. We will also be partnering with the health care providers, schools, community organizations, States, and Tribes, and cities at the same time.
The bottom line is this: The vaccine for kids between the ages of 12 and 15 are safe, effective, easy, fast, and free. So my hope is that parents will take advantage of the vaccine and get their kids vaccinated.
Now, let's remember that millions of 16- and 17-year-olds have also been safely vaccinated. And as more and more Americans get vaccinated, COVID-19 hospitalizations and death rates continue to fall. Today the New York Times reported the number of COVID hospitalizations in the United States since April of 2020, right after the start of this pandemic, is the lowest.
Safe and effective vaccines are curbing the spread of the virus, and they're saving thousands of lives and allowing millions of Americans to start returning to a closer-to-normal life.
As I said earlier, for everyone 12 years and up, it's never been easier or more convenient to get vaccinated. Visit vaccine.gov to find out where, or text your ZIP Code to 438829. That is 438829. Text your ZIP Code to that number, and you'll find the closest vaccine facilities to you as—that moment. It's easy, it's convenient, and it's free.
So if you haven't gotten vaccinated or still have questions, talk to someone you trust: your physician, your pharmacist, your next-door neighbor who got the shot. Talk to your faith leaders. Look at the folks in your community who have gotten vaccinated and are getting back to living their lives: the grandparents united with their grandkids, friends getting together again.
I've been saying for a long—this for a long time, but I believe it: This is not a Democratic or Republican issue; this is about life and death. It's about getting us closer to normal.
Let me conclude with this: In light of the end of—that we've been talking about—there's a light at the end of the tunnel—well, it's growing brighter and brighter. And we need all of you to bring it home.
Americans ages 12 and up: Get vaccinated. And on July 4, let's celebrate our independence as a nation and our independence of this virus. We can do this.
And as I said a little bit earlier today in another context, you know, I don't believe that the American people—there's any significant portion of American people who refuse to get vaccinated. You keep hearing about how Republicans won't—and this. Look, if it's available, if it's nearby, if it's convenient, people are getting vaccinated. I believe the vast majority of Americans are going to get vaccinated. That's the route we're going now.
So may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. And if you've been vaccinated, you don't have to wear this outside around people unless there's really large groups. And you don't have to wear it inside if you're with people that you—that have also been vaccinated. So protect yourself. Protect your neighbors.
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Ransomware Attack on the Colonial Pipeline Network/Gasoline Prices and Supply/Cybersecurity Education and Training/Workforce Development 
Q. Mr. President, what do you say to Americans who are worried about the supply of gas and rising prices right now?
The President. We have been in very, very close contact with Colonial Pipeline, which is the one area you're talking about, where the—one of the reasons that gasoline prices are going up. And I think you're going to hear some good news in the next 24 hours. And I think we'll be getting that under control.
Secondly, I have, in the meantime, made it easier for us to have lifted some of the restrictions on the transportation of fuel, as well as access to the United States military providing fuel and with vehicles to get it there—where—places where it's badly needed.
And I'd also point out that I think what this shows is that—I think we have to make a greater investment in education as it relates to being able to train and graduate more people proficient in cybersecurity.
And I've been saying for a long, long time now—I know I probably—you could probably say it for me, but I think that one of the most important things we have to do to reclaim our place as a leading innovator in the world is to have a better educated workforce.
And that goes back to the days—long time ago now, over 5 years ago—when I was Vice President and I surveyed all the Fortune 500 companies. I said, ""What do you most need?"" And remember what they said: better educated workforce. But they're not spending money to educate the workforce.
And—but it's important that we do this. And the cybersecurity piece is one, I think, you're going to see where we need significantly larger number of experts in the area of cybersecurity working for private companies, as well as private companies being willing to share data as to what—how they're protecting themselves.
I think that's part of the long-term answer not just in terms of energy, but across the board. I know that's not a direct response to your question, but it does impact on it, I think, down the road.
Q. [Inaudible]—sir?
[At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.]
Israel/International Diplomatic Efforts/Rocket Attacks From Gaza 
Q. Are you concerned about the violence in the Middle East? And can you talk about what conversations you have had with officials there?
The President. My national security staff and Defense staff has been in constant contact with their counterparts in the Middle East—not just with the Israelis, but also with everyone from the Egyptians, to the Saudis, to the Emiratis, et cetera.
And I had a conversation with Bibi Netanyahu not too long ago. I'll be putting out a statement very shortly on that.
My expectation and hope is that this will be closing down sooner than later. But Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory.
But I had a conversation for a while with the Prime Minister of Israel. And I think that—my hope is that we'll see this coming to a conclusion sooner than later.
Thank you.
The President's Meeting With Congressional Leadership/Bipartisan Outreach/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. What's your take on the end of your meeting, sir? Were you optimistic coming out of it today?
The President. Which one? Which one of the 12 I've had? [Laughter]
Q. Pelosi, Schumer, and the crew.
Q. Infrastructure, sir. And in particular——
The President. You guys are bad. I'm not supposed to be answering all these questions. I'm supposed to leave, but I can't resist your questions.
I came away encouraged. And—but I want to make it clear to you: I'm encouraged not just because of a solid meeting with—with the Republican Leader in the House and with Mitch—or Senator McConnell, who I've known a long, long time and worked with. I've been meeting with bipartisan leaders for a long time now. I've met with gosh knows how many.
I mean, and there's more than one single group. There's a bipartisan organization—you know, groups that're made up of 10 to 20 members. There's been groups that I met with—
For example, I met with—yesterday, with Kyrsten Sinema. I thought that was a—and she purported, and I believe her, to speak for some of the bipartisan—her friends who are both sides of the aisle about how to do deal—how to go forward with infrastructure.
So I'm—generically, I'm encouraged that there is room to have a compromise on a bipartisan bill that's solid and significant and a means by which to pay for it without dropping all of the burden on middle class and working class people.
Look, what's the one thing people are concerned about with the gas? Gasoline prices going up. Exactly right. And it matters if you make $40,000 a year. It matters if you're a two-family person and making 80-, 90,000 dollars, two family—two wage earners. It matters.
And what I don't want to do—and this will be another discussion we didn't get into today—is how to pay for it. And if everything is paid for by a user fee, well, then, you know, the burden falls on working class folks who are having trouble. They're—we're getting them out of the—they're coming around, but it has—this has to be a burden shared across the spectrum.
Anyway, thank you, guys.

Biden, Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leadership and an Exchange With Reporters Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/349901 ",,,,,,,,,,,
11-May-21,Remarks at a Virtual Meeting With Governors,"The President. Well, first of all, hi, everybody. It's good to—I'm supposed to look over here and not at you guys. [Laughter] But we got six Governors with us today—Democrats and Republicans, are—and they're meeting the moment: Governor Mills of Maine, Governor DeWine of Ohio, Governor Cox of Utah, Governor Walz of Minnesota, Governor Baker of Massachusetts, and Governor Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. And it's great to connect with you all.
You know, last week, I provided an update on where we were with our vaccination program and what comes next. And I said our goal, by July the 4th, is to have 70 percent of adult Americans with at least one shot and 160 million Americans fully vaccinated.
And that's a pretty huge goal, I acknowledge that, but you've done a remarkable job. But if we succeed, we're going to be able to take a serious step toward a return to normalcy by Independence Day, which is a goal that was not arbitrarily, but based on talking to the docs—thought if we did what we'd had to do, we could meet.
And there's a lot of work to do, though, to get there. But I believe we can get there. And part of the reason I'm so confident is because of—[laughter]—your leadership, the Governors, and your partnership with us.
The Governors with us today and their counterparts have been instrumental in helping us make progress and—more quickly than anyone would have thought. Working together, we delivered over 220 million shots in my first 100 days—well beyond anyone's expectations, but because of their cooperation.
And today, more than 150 million Americans have gotten at least one shot. Over 115 million Americans are fully vaccinated. Nearly 85 percent of people—excuse me—65 and over have gotten at least one shot. And whether it's a red State or a blue State, Black, White, Latino, AAPI—Americans from every walk of life are getting their vaccines. We got more to do though.
Now, cases and hospitalizations and deaths are all down. Tens of thousands of moms and dads, brothers and sisters, grandparents, neighbors, friends are still with us who, I believe—would have otherwise—we would have lost but for the work of these Governors.
And millions of Americans are starting to live life more normally after more than a year of sacrifice. And I know everybody is tired of hearing me say this online here, but it isn't Democratic progress or Republican progress, it's American progress.
And now we've got to take the next step together. I know every week you meet with Jeff Zients, who's here with me, and he—you go through it. And I've had a chance to meet with the Governors' conference and others, but it's—we decided from the very beginning, as you all remember, that—how many govs did you speak with in the last—just today was the——
White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeffrey D. Zients. Well, today we had our weekly call.
The President. Yes, weekly.
Coordinator Zients. So most Governors attend that call, which is great.
The President. And—but the point is that we know we want to get something done. It's all about Governors and mayors and county executives. It's all local. It's on the street.
And to meet the goal that I set last week, we need to accomplish three things, in my view. One, we have to make it easier and more convenient for all Americans to get vaccinated. And you're busting your neck doing that. Two, to build confidence in vaccines by delivering facts and answering questions to anyone who might have one and have thorough answers. And three, by ensuring that we reach everyone with an equitable response that—as we enter this next phase.
And to help us get there, we've added two new tools. One, Americans can go to vaccines.gov. Or they can text their ZIP Code to 3—excuse me, misspoke—their ZIP Code, text it to 438829. Let me say it again: 438829. And they'll get at least three locations near them with vaccines in stock at that moment.
And at my direction, more than 20,000 pharmacies coast to coast are now offering walk-in vaccinations by no appointment necessary. And the Governors are—you all are stepping up to increase the availability of walk-in vaccinations as well.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is shifting focus from larger vaccination sites to smaller community-based sites and mobile clinics to reach more people where they are.
And we've recently made significant new investments around vaccine education, including funds to help states and community organizations get the word out on the local level.
Just yesterday the Food and Drug Administration expanded the emergency use author-—authorization for the Pfizer vaccine for children 12- to 15-years of age. Twelve to fifteen. That more parents—that means parents who want to protect their children, younger teens who want to get vaccinated—we're a step closer to that goal now.
And today I'm also announcing additional steps. To ensure that transportation is less of a barrier, from May 24 through July 4, Uber and Lyft—Uber and Lyft—are both going to offer everyone free rides to and from vaccination sites. I think that is really stepping up. Both Uber and Lyft—free rides to—they'll wait—and from—they'll take you back home.
And it makes it easy for students who will work with Federal pharmacy partners to bring on-campus vaccines sites to dozens of the Nation's largest community colleges this summer. And I want to thank the Governors here for making it easy as possible for students to get vaccinated.
And finally, I'm announcing today that FEMA is making support available immediately for community vaccination outreach efforts. This will help States, Tribes, Territories, local governments, and community and faith-based organizations to make more progress on the ground: things like phone banking, door-to-door canvassing, pop-up vaccination sites at workplaces and houses of worship.
And so, once again, Governors in so many states, particularly the six that are here, have been essential partners in this effort. And they know it isn't about politics; it's about saving lives and livelihoods, rebuilding our economy, and getting us back to our way of life.
So it gets to have—so, you know, the idea that we have six of the best Governors who have worked on this with me today is really a pleasure. And all of you have done a remarkable job. And with your permission, I'd like to hear from you about the best practices and innovations that have worked for you, what you've learned across these three areas: on improving access, building confidence, and ensuring equity.
And I would like to start by talking about improving access to vaccines. Governor Mills of Maine and Governor DeWine of Ohio, both of you have developed creative programs to meet people where they are. Governor Mills, if you don't mind, I like to ask you how are you reaching out to people and encouraging them to get vaccinated? And what kind of success are you having?
Governor Janet T. Mills of Maine. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for all you're doing to help us get shots in arms. It's a great honor to join you and fellow Governors across the Nation to share these innovative ways that Maine is vaccinating people against COVID-19.
Maine has had some of the lowest numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the country since the onset of the pandemic. The people of our State believe in the science, and they have followed public health protocols to prevent the spread of the virus.
Now we are closing in on the 70 percent of adults that you want us to close in on—70 percent of adults in Maine having received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine—the goal you set. Right now we're at 67 percent.
The President. All right.
Gov. Mills. And about 53 percent of all eligible people in Maine are fully vaccinated.
[At this point, Gov. Mills continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
We're calling this ""Your Shot To Get Outdoors."" Oh, it's corny, I know. [Laughter] But we know that people in Maine have found refuge and relief in Mother Nature throughout the pandemic. So these incentives will encourage that outdoor activity while getting more shots in arms as quickly as possible.
So thank you, Mr. President, for your support of—for all the States. Maine is doing everything we can to put this pandemic behind us. We're giving it our best shot.
Thank you. [Laughter]
The President. Well, Gov, thank you. Thank you. I think that it's remarkable what you're doing.
[The President coughed.]
And you know, I—excuse me. I—well, I'll get back. I want to hear from Mike first, then I want to ask you both a question, if I may.
Mike, Gov. Fire away. Ohio.
Governor Mike DeWine of Ohio. President—Mr. President, thank you for doing this. We appreciate you listening. I want to say hi to Jeff and tell him we appreciate his work and the fact that he listens. We were on the phone again today, so that's very, very helpful to us.
[Gov. DeWine continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
Our National Guard is going out and has been going out for weeks into senior housing, taking it right into the lobby, setting up shop, vaccinating people. All they have to do is come down from their rooms. And that has worked, we think, very, very well.
We're really decentralized in Ohio, Mr. President. We have 113 local health departments.
The President. Yes.
Gov. DeWine. And it's the local health departments, it's the mayors, it's the counties—they're the ones who are really the action here.
[Gov. DeWine continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
We've done the same thing with colleges, before college was out for the summer. We've done it with—working with our labor unions. We've done it working with businesses; a lot of innovation going on in businesses. And what we found is that businesses that have us come in, have a health partner that does it, they work very closely with their employees, and they're able to get an uptake that, quite candidly, I don't think we would have gotten any other way but by taking that directly——
The President. Yes.
Gov. DeWine. ——directly into that business.
We are really at the ground game now. We've always been at the ground game. But I think you're seeing Governors, you know, continue to push out and go to where people are. We have some health departments that are literally out knocking on doors. We have mobile clinics going around. And we want to reach people, you know, exactly where they are.
Just a couple observations: There certainly has been an appetite for the Johnson and Johnson. We're——
The President. Yes.
Gov. DeWine. We're seeing that the people who really want Johnson and Johnson, they want that one shot and to be done.
There also clearly was an appetite for walkup clinics. And so, you know, most of the clinics in Ohio, as you said, are open for walkups and people are—there's people who just want to go; they want to make up their mind that day and go out and be able to knock on the door.
Finally, we're very, very excited about being able to vaccinate 12-, 13-, 14-, and 15-year-olds.
The President. Yes.
Gov. DeWine. And we've got plans in school, but we also have plans in the summer with boys' club, girls' clubs, feeding programs, and other things, trying to take this to where people are.
So thank you for doing this, Mr. President.
The President. Well, thank you both for what you guys are doing.
And one of the things that I wanted to ask Governor Mills is that the idea of engaging in and offering benefits, like everything from fishing licenses on—my guess is—and free tickets and vouchers—my guess is that's probably going to work. I mean, do you have any——
Gov. Mills. I think so. [Laughter] I think so. We're offering a great spectrum of things. And I think it will be an incentive to those who still—may be still hesitant.
You know, people who'd love to go L.L. Bean or go online and buy a new hunting vest or whatnot. And people want to go to the Sea Dogs because, as Charlie Baker knows, the season has opened up.
The President. Yes.
Gov. Mills. I think it's a good incentive. I know other States are doing something different.
The President. Yes.
Gov. Mills. Some are offering shots of booze, but—[laughter]. New Jersey, Connecticut——
The President. Can I ask you a—both of you one last question? I'm sorry to take so long here, but I'm interested.
Tell me about what the mobile vaccine unit is like. I mean, are you driving around in a—with docs in a pickup truck or are you—[laughter]—I mean—no, I'm being deadly earnest. For people—this is being zoomed—that—talk to me about—if you each tell me what you're doing.
Gov. Mills. I've been through our mobile unit, and it's very attractive, very clean. It's a big, like, trailer-kind of thing——
The President. Yes.
Gov. Mills. ——a vehicle. And it's staffed by people from the United States Health Service—Public Health Service and some National Guard and some FEMA people. And it's a great level of cooperation among those agencies and with the State of Maine and local governments.
And I've seen people delighted—being able to drive up; get out; walk through the trailer; sit for—sit back in their car for 15 minutes; be watched, you know, remotely; and drive off feeling free and clear of COVID.
The President. Yes.
Mike, how about you?
Gov. DeWine. Mr. President, all mobile clinics are not alike, at least in Ohio.
The President. Yes.
Gov. DeWine. Just a couple examples. Ohio Northern University is going out into small communities. And they announce when they're going to be there. They're going to be here ""this afternoon"" in ""this community,"" so it allows people in smaller communities to have it in their community and they know when it's coming.
[Gov. DeWine continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And so getting that person, getting them the vaccines—make it easy, make it convenient—I think is very important.
The President. Well, thank you both. You're doing a heck of a job. I'd like to turn to Governor Cox, now, of Utah and Governor Walz of Minnesota.
Another critical issue is increasing confidence among people who are hesitant to get the vaccine. Governor Cox, I know you're bringing community leaders in to build confidence. Tell me about your efforts, and what—how it practically is functioning—what you're see from those efforts.
Governor Spencer J. Cox of Utah. Well, thank you, Mr. President. It's great to be with you. We appreciate Jeff taking all of our complaints over the past few months. He's been remarkable in helping us resolve all of those, and mostly putting up——
The President. And by the way, he doesn't own any pharmacies. I just want you guys to know. [Laughter]
Gov. Cox. We're very well aware. But thanks for allowing us to participate and highlight some of the good things we are doing and that are working well.
By the way, just an aside to a—and a tip for our media partners. I occasionally see reporting that focuses on what percentage of the total population has been vaccinated. That's great for places like Maine with the oldest population in the country. For places like Utah with the youngest population in the country—of course, a large, significant portion of our State that is not eligible to be vaccinated—that's not exactly the right metric to be using.
But we're very excited for the announcement——
The President. Good point.
Gov. Cox. ——to roll out younger people to get vaccinated because Utah has more of them than anywhere else. We're—Mr. President, we're really good at having kids here. So we're excited to have that that opportunity.
[Gov. Cox continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
We want people to understand that the vaccine is really the key to ending that. And that's one area where we could use some help from the White House and others, and that is modeling what a fully vaccinated person can do.
The President. Yes.
Gov. Cox. I would like to say that we have fully vaccinated people; we should start acting like it. And that's a big motivation get the unvaccinated to want to get vaccinated.
The President. That's a good point.
Gov. Cox. Next up, we focused on the ""who."" And, I think, Mr. President, this may be the most important of all.
[Gov. Cox continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And we're finding that those trusted voices are helping us with that next phase of people who are a little unsure or just didn't have enough time to get around to it. We're taking out all of the excuses to not get a vaccine.
The President. Yes.
Gov. Cox. And that's where we are now, Mr. President. We're excited as we continue to reach towards that goal of getting 70 percent of our adults vaccinated.
The President. Well, you're doing a heck of a job. And the idea you're talking about is what we, nationally, can do, in terms of making—drawing a portrait of what it means if you're fully vaccinated, what you can do and what you can't do, relative to the rest of the population. And we're just getting there now to the degree that I think you're going to see a more aggressive effort on our part to lay out that, once vaccinated, it's not only you can hug your grandchildren, you can do a lot more—and whether or not you have to have even, at some point soon, masks inside versus outside.
I mean, so we're—and if anything, we've been—we've gone a little slower to make sure we're exactly right as—in terms of the percent of the population that has been vaccinated—the adult population.
But, I think, Jeff, we're going to be moving on that in the next little bit, aren't we?
Coordinator Zients. Yes. I think we expect more and more guidance from the CDC——
The President. Yes.
Coordinator Zients. ——for vaccinated people.
The President. And you know, it's not everything, but it's—I think you're right about it would increase the prospects of the desire to get vaccinated, you know, as well.
And one of the things—Tim, what are you seeing up in your State right now?
Governor Timothy J. Walz of Minnesota. Well, first of all, thank you, Mr. President, for making this opportunity available. I'll echo our thanks to Jeff Zients and his team. They pick up the phone no matter what the question is, and they get us answers.
[Gov. Walz continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
But I think being transparent, open, and use that data with the public shows them you measure what you care about, and that's how we focus——
The President. Yes.
Gov. Walz. ——much like, it sounds like, Utah. And my guess is many others are doing it.
But each State is a little different. And I think we had some built-in advantages. One is, we had trusted third-party validators, like the Mayo Clinic, to be able to validate some of this data.
But we also have a tradition here: We had the highest voter turnout in the last election. We also had the highest census return. I'm sure that's to the angst of New York, but we were able to do that. And the strategies that it takes to get people to vote—like Governor Cox said, some are very enthusiastic about it. Some, maybe, go if they have the opportunity. Same thing with the census.
So what we understood was—is, the folks who make those so successful are local trusted partners, as you've heard.
The President. Yes.
Gov. Walz. And one of the great success stories is listening to those folks who know how to do it.
Here in Minnesota, we have 11 sovereign Tribal nations. They did this better than anybody else in the country. They focused on their elders. They focused on multigenerational households. And they focused on delivering where people were at.
That same model—we're, kind of, one of the centers of pork and poultry production. Those facilities were some of the hardest hit.
The President. Yes.
Gov. Walz. They are—many of them are communities of color and immigrant community. There are multigenerational households that can spread amongst a nexus of Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota. And those communities had many reasons to be hesitant: They were hit hard. There were casualties. There was a lack of trust in those communities.
[Gov. Walz continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And when I got my vaccine, I was glad I took my friend along—a predecessor of mine, former Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty.
The President. Yes.
Gov. Walz. And we got vaccinated together. And my message to folks: There's a lot of good reasons to get vaccinated. But for some of them, you know, if you need another one, go get vaccinated so you're alive to vote against me in the next election. [Laughter] I don't care. I just want to get it done.
[Gov. Walz continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And I'm proud to say we're at 64 percent of your goal today, Mr. President. We will be there, but I think all of us know this is going to be a little longer process——
The President. Yes.
Gov. Walz. ——but folks are coming along. So I want to thank you for highlighting this, and I want to thank the fellow Governors for all the advice and good ideas they've been able to give to us.
The President. Well, Tim, you've been a standup guy and going out and just reaching out to every place you can.
And one of the things that I found—and I've been to an awful lot of vaccination sites around the country and in my home State—is that it really does get down to—for that person who allegedly is an antivaxxer, it gets down, in many cases, just to convenience. Like, you're walking through the gate: ""Oh, yes, okay. Yes, I'm here. Go ahead. You know, give me a shot. I can do it.""
And that's what I—I've been so impressed. And it doesn't surprise me, actually, that Governors and local officials are really good at knowing how to do that. It's a little bit like, you know, getting out the census, as you said. So I appreciate that.
Now I—you know, before we hear from the final two Governors, I want to bring my top adviser on health equity and—Governor Marcella Nunez-Smith. And—""Governor""; I made her a Governor—Doctor. [Laughter] I just—I'm not sure whether you view as a promotion or a demotion, but I think it's a promotion.
But, at any rate, tell us what's going on, and give us a quick overview of the work you've been doing to—do—to ensure the equity response. Because we've been told that—you know, that, in fact—anyway, I'll let you do the talking here.
White House COVID-19 Equity Task Force Chair Marcella Nunez-Smith. Thank you so much. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Good afternoon, Governors. It's just so very good to be with you today. I want to echo and thank you so much to you on your teams—all that you're doing to center equity in your vaccination campaigns.
[Chair Nunez-Smith continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
So, just as I wrap, I want to say: We know equity does not happen by default, and it never has. So thank you for all you're doing for sustaining this commitment and, of course, for your leadership.
The President. Well, thank you very much.
And now I want to bring in Governor Baker of Massachusetts and Governor Lujan Grisham in New Mexico, who have been focused on equity in their States responsible—and respond to this pandemic.
And, first, to you, Gov: Governor Baker. Can you share with us how the Commonwealth is making sure that every community has an access and information and opportunity to get vaccinated?
And tell me, if you don't mind—give me your opinion on whether you think Lyft and—and you know, with these two outfits are going to provide free transportation. It that seems to me, where I come from, a lot of the communities of color use these facilities and—because they don't have automobiles.
So anyway, I don't want to hold you up from the game here either, Charlie, but you've been doing a hell of a job across the board. You really have. Hope that doesn't ruin your reputation—
Governor Charles D. Baker of Massachusetts. Well——
The President. ——coming from a Democrat, but you're doing a hell of job.
Gov. Baker. [Laughter] Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. President. And I'm going to also give Jeff Zients and his team a shout-out for all the work they've been doing to help us help you, the American people, succeed in getting vaccinated.
[Gov. Baker continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And, I guess, I would say that I think the transportation issue is a big deal, and the decision to include folks like Lyft and Uber in this can make a big difference.
We have special programs for homebound folks——
The President. Yes.
Gov. Baker. ——that we do in conjunction with our local boards of health, where they are literally identifying populations that can't get to a vaccination site no matter how close it might be, and making sure that we're going out and meeting them where they are and making sure they get vaccinated the same way everybody else does.
I think the other thing I would say is that, for all of us, one of our great opportunities and our great challenges to get over—whether it's hesitancy or equity or more confidence—is, the more people see this happening among their friends and their families and——
The President. Absolutely.
Gov. Baker. ——and coworkers, the more likely they are to sign up and say: ""You know what? I'm willing to play."" And the walkup stuff has made a big difference too.
The President. Yes.
Gov. Baker. I was visiting—I was visiting one of our pop-up sites last week, and they had about 50 or 60 appointment visits; they had 700 walkups.
[Gov. Baker continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
Now, let me just close, again, by saying how much we appreciate the chance we've had to work with your administration on this. And we're going to work really hard to make sure we get everybody who wants a vaccine vaccinated by the Fourth of July.
The President. Well, thanks, Charlie. Thank you. You're doing a hell of a job.
Governor Lujan Grisham, what about New Mexico? How're you doing out there?
Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. You know, we—as my good friend and colleague Governor Baker mentioned that we were leading, and now all of these fantastic Governors and so many more are chasing us or eclipsing us.
And this positive—as you say, Mr. President—approach to getting every American vaccinated is making a difference. And we are effective collaborators. And with your team and Jeff Zients and others, it provides the kind of ecosystem for us to leverage any number of best practices.
And as I'm—I can tell you that we're going to meet your goal and exceed it by shots—first shots—70 percent by July 4. And we've made a statement that, by July 1, we're going to hit all of our targets.
But I want to tell you, for a multicultural—a minority-majority State—23 sovereign nations in New Mexico, Mr. President——
The President. That's right.
Gov. Grisham. ——and they're going to have 70 percent or more of their population with two shots by July 4th, and probably earlier. And we have some sovereign nations that have a 95-percent——
The President. Yes.
Gov. Grisham. ——two shots in arms, fully vaccinated population.
[Gov. Grisham continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
The third thing that we are doing that we believe will also continue to do that equity-focused investment: We set aside 25 percent of our vaccines at the very earliest to make sure that we always had equity-driven vaccine access. But New Mexico has more than 50 percent—more than half of our population, Mr. President, is on Medicaid.
The President. Yes.
Gov. Grisham. Now we can use that Medicaid data—and I can tell you, both from an equity standpoint and just an access standpoint, I can tell every primary care physician who in their patient population is yet to be vaccinated and push those vaccines into those doctor's offices by utilizing Medicaid information.
[Gov. Grisham continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
Every time somebody has a good idea—I heard about hunting and fishing licenses; I'm on it. [Laughter] So every time somebody has a good idea, we're deploying it, and we appreciate your support to do that.
The President. Well, you've done an incredible job. And I know you know Jill—I'm Jill's husband—[laughter]—has been out to Navajo Nation now on three occasions.
And one of the things that I—just a closing comment. I'm trespassing on your time, I know. But I am of the view—and I've been characterized as a congenital optimist, so maybe you can discount what I'm about to say.
But I think the experience we've had with what has been one of the—because of all of your work—the—maybe the most significant, major logistical undertaking that we've ever done, short of war, here—getting all this out and done; I mean, continuing to get it done—I think we're going to find the lessons you've all learned and we've all learned from this are going to apply to a whole hell of a lot more of what we do in terms of delivering health care.
And I'm not talking about more government spending, I'm talking about being able to communicate and connect people with basic health care. And there's new science going on right now about the mRNA, you know, capacity to be able to adjust to maybe even dealing with cancer and other diseases. And I think that it's—we're—there are going to be other—other pandemics. And we've got to—and I'm dealing with other world leaders about how we're going to deal with it because you can't—you can't build a wall high enough to keep a virus out.
But I'm of the—I am optimistic. I think we're going to see, in the next 3 or 4 years, the ability to provide access to and uptake of significant additional health care initiatives that are going to affect everything from the basic scientific research, the companies like Pfizer and others are going to be doing with their mN—Nm—[laughter]——
Coordinator Zients. mRNA.
The President. ——mRNA vaccines, as well as applying it to other diseases as well, and some of them communicable diseases.
But at any rate, I just want to thank you all. You know, you've done—you've been great partners in this effort, and I hope we haven't been an impediment. We've—I've—we've tried like hell—no, I really mean it—we've tried like hell to include and engage you all as much as we possibly could and not get in the way.
I know, occasionally, you know, when I—I got some criticism when I decided we were going to engage the public health clinics around the country and get them involved, and not from you all, but you know, from others. And—but I think you've done incredible work. And it's why I think we get a lot more done at the State level, in terms of cooperation among Democrats and Republicans, than we do federally.
And so none of this could have worked without your leadership. I really mean it. I'm not trying to be solicitous. I'm being completely honest. So thank you, thank you, thank you. I think you're responsible—I know you're responsible for saving thousands of lives. The idea we've lost well over 550,000 lives—more than every war we fought combined in 1 year, basically—is astounding. And imagine what it would be if we didn't have you all doing what you did.
So thank you, thank you, thank you. And one other thing you're going to be hearing about—it wasn't supposed to be part of what I'm talking about—but every country in the world is now looking to us to provide for their lack of capacity to produce and/or have vaccines. I'm not going to shortcut the United States of America. I promise you we're going to have enough vaccine for every single American. But we are going to be engaged in working with other countries because there are going to be a lot of variants that are going to be coming from other countries that we're going to have to be aware of as well.
But—and I may get back to all of you for some ideas on how I go about doing that, but I think we can produce a whole hell of a lot more vaccines that we can make available. There are already—how many we got out of the——
Coordinator Zients. We've committed to 60 million doses.
The President. Well, we're not using AstraZeneca vaccine. And I've committed the distribution of 60 million doses to two other countries—our neighboring countries—who are desperately in need of vaccines.
But there's just an awful lot. I literally have virtually 40 percent of the world leaders calling and asking can we help them, and we're going to try.
But, at any rate, I just want to thank you again for what you've done. You've been wonderful, and I look forward to seeing you all in person as soon as we get everybody that—we get above that 70 percent. Thank you, tha",,,,,,,,,,,,,

10-May-21,Remarks on the National Economy and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon. Excuse me.
Ransomware Attack on Colonial Pipeline Network 
I'd like to start by saying a few words about the ransomware cyberattack currently impacting Colonial Pipeline. This is something that my administration—our administration have been tracking extremely carefully. And I have been perfectly—personally briefed every day.
The Department of Energy is working directly with Colonial to get the pipelines back online and operating at full capacity as quickly and safely as possible. The FBI also is engaged to assess the—and address this attack. The agencies across the Government have attacked quickly to mitigate any impact on our fuel supply.
And over the weekend, at my direction, the Department of Transportation issued an emergency order to loosen restrictions on truck drivers in order to allow more fuel to be transported via tanker. We're prepared to take additional steps, depending on how quickly the company is able to bring its pipeline back to full operational capacity.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has determined Colonial's network was infected by ransomware, and it's a criminal act, obviously. The FBI released details of the attack so others can take steps to prevent being infected.
My administration takes issue—this—takes this very seriously. We have efforts underway with the FBI and DOJ—Department of Justice—to disrupt and prosecute ransomware criminals. And my administration will be pursuing a global effort of ransomware attacks by transnational criminals who often use global money-laundering networks to carry them out.
My administration is also committed to safeguarding our critical infrastructure, which—much of which is privately owned and managed, like Colonial. Private entities are making their own determination on cybersecurity.
So to jumpstart greater private-sector investment in cybersecurity, we launched a new public-private initiative in April. It begins with a hundred-day sprint to improve cybersecurity in the electric sector, and we'll follow that with similar initiatives in natural gas pipelines, water, and other sectors. In addition to companies stepping up, we need to invest to safeguard our critical infrastructure. That's one of the many things my American Jobs Plan is designed to do.
National Economy 
I also want to update the people on the progress that we've made in our recovery and the next steps that we're going to be taking.
As we learned Friday, the economy created 266,000 jobs in April. In fact, altogether, since the time we took office, we've created more than 1.5 million jobs in the country. It's the most jobs created in the first hundred days of any President on record: more than three times the solid job creation that President Carter [Clinton]* saw in his first hundred days and more than six times what President Reagan saw.
In the 3 months before I got here, our country was creating roughly 60,000 jobs a month. In the 3 months since we've gotten here, we've been creating five hundred—on average, 500,000 jobs per month. In the first quarter, our economy grew at 6.4-percent rate, outpacing the growth we're seeing from other—from our friends in the euro zone.
Because of the American Rescue Plan, forecasters are projecting, we'll see the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years in the months to come. We're moving in the right direction. So let's be clear: Our economic plan is working. I never said—and no serious analyst ever suggested—that climbing out of the deep, deep hole our economy was in would be simple, easy, immediate, or perfectly steady. Remember, 22 million Americans lost their jobs in this pandemic.
So some months will exceed expectations; others will fall short. The question is: ""What is the trendline? Are we headed in the right direction? Are we taking the right steps to keep it going?"" And the answer, clearly, is yes.
I also want to offer a bit more detail on the month's jobs numbers, in particular. These months—these monthly reports are a snapshot, as you all know. A one—it's a—they take 1 week, a moment in time. Since this snapshot was taken around the week of April the 12th—since then, COVID-19 counts are down by more than 40 percent since then, and vaccination rates among working-age Americans has roughly doubled since then.
This survey was taken before adults—before every adult was eligible to be vaccinated. So, back then, 18 percent of working-age adults were fully vaccinated. Today, if it were taken, 34 percent are fully vaccinated. No wonder things in America feel better today than they did back when the survey was taken.
With that context, here are the steps we're going to be taking to maintain our progress. First, today we're opening a portal for State and local governments to apply for their—the first funds from the American Rescue Plan. Because States and local governments have to balance their budgets, a lot of them had to lay off employees when the economy—State and Federal—State employees and local employees when the economy slowed and tax revenues fell. We're talking about 1.3 million State and local employees out of work.
Now—but now the money we're distributing—going to be distributing now is going to make it possible for an awful lot of educators, first responders, sanitation workers to go back to work.
Second—this is a yearlong program. Second, we're delivering assistance to tens of thousands of restaurants and bars across the country. Today we're sending out the first relief checks to 16,000 hard-hit restaurants with help for many more to follow. A lot more people are going to be employed.
Third, the employers bring back laid-off workers. To help them do that, we're going to remind them that there is some progress they can take advantage—some programs they can take advantage of. For example, employers can hire back their laid-off workers part time without those workers having to give up all of their unemployment benefits.
Here is another example: In the American Rescue Plan, we expanded a tax incentive called ""Employee Retention Tax Credit."" This can provide a recovering small or medium-sized—a small or medium-sized business a direct credit for each worker they keep on or a job that they rehire.
Fourth, we're going to provide real help for people struggling with the challenge of childcare, which is making it hard for many parents who need to work—especially women—to get back to work.
During this crisis, thousands of childcare providers and centers were forced to close because they couldn't make ends meet with fewer students and higher costs to keep them safe. As a result, parents lost support—lost the support system they depended on for childcare, and tens of thousands of childcare workers lost their jobs. In fact, there are 150,000 fewer childcare jobs now than there were prepandemic.
The American Rescue Plan has already allocated funds to States to address the immediate challenge to our economy and of too few childcare operations. This is a largest investment in childcare since World War II.
Today my administration is releasing guidance to States to help get the funds they need out the door as quickly as possible to allow dramatic expansion and availability of childcare in this country. With these funds, States can help hundreds of thousands of providers reopen and stay open and provide safe and healthy learning environments for more than 5 million children.
These funds will also allow States to provide over 800,000 families with subsidies to pay for childcare. Simply put, it's going to help working parents get back to work. This one-time investment is a real answer to a real problem where—our economy is facing right now.
Well, look, the fifth thing we're going to do: We're going to make it clear that anyone collecting unemployment who is offered a suitable job must take the job or lose their unemployment benefits. There are a few COVID-19-related exceptions so that people aren't forced to choose between their basic safety and a paycheck, but otherwise, that's the law.
I know there's been a lot of discussion since Friday—since Friday's report that people are being paid to stay home rather than go to work. Well, we don't see much evidence of that. That is a major factor—we don't see that—look, it's easy to say—the line has been, because of the generous unemployment benefits that it's a major factor in labor shortages.
Americans want to work. Americans want to work. And as my dad used to say, ""A job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it's about your dignity, your place in the community, being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Everything is going to be okay.'"" I think the people who claim Americans won't work even if they find a good and fair opportunity underestimate the American people. So we'll insist that the law is followed with respect to benefits, but we're not going to turn our backs on our fellow Americans.
Twenty-two million people lost their jobs in this pandemic through no fault of their own. They lost their jobs to a virus and to a Government that bungled its response to the crisis and failed to protect them. We still have 8 million fewer jobs than we did when the pandemic started. And for many of those folks, unemployment benefits are a lifeline. No one should be allowed to game the system, and we'll insist the law is followed, but let's not take our eye off the ball.
Families—families who are just trying to put food on the table, keep a roof over their head—they aren't the problem. We need to stay focused on the real problems in front of us: beating this pandemic and creating jobs.
Again, the law is clear: If you're receiving unemployment benefits and you're offered a suitable job, you can't refuse that job and just keep getting the unemployment benefits.
We're also working to overcome all the barriers that may be making it harder for people to get back to work: childcare, getting vaccinated, getting schools open. We're making progress in all these things. And we need others to step up and play a role as well.
For example, we need employers to step up in a couple of ways. First, we need them to get help to their people and get them vaccinated. Two weeks ago, I announced that we will provide a tax credit to employers if they give workers paid time off to get a shot and recover from the effects of the—the side effects, if there are any. Our economy can't achieve its full potential until we get more people vaccinated. Employers can help that.
And we also need to recognize that people will come back to work if they're paid a decent wage. The last Congress before I became President gave businesses over $1.4 trillion in COVID relief. Congress may have approved that money, but let's be clear: The money came from the American people. And it went from the American people to American businesses, many of them big businesses, to help them get through this pandemic and keep their doors open.
I'm not questioning it; it was the right thing to do. But my expectation is that, as our economy comes back, these companies will provide fair wages and safe work environments. And if they do, they'll find plenty of workers, and we're all going to come out of this together better than before.
So we need to stay focused on creating jobs and beating this pandemic today, and building back better for tomorrow. America—the American Rescue Plan is just that: a rescue plan. It's to get us out of the crisis and back on the track, but it's not nearly enough.
That's why we need the American Jobs Plan, which is an 8-year investment strategy to make sure working people of this country get to share in the benefits of a rising economy and to put us in a position to win the competition with China and the rest of the world for the 21st century.
That's the next stage. That's what I'm—we're doing right now. We're working to get that passed.
I want to thank you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Infrastructure 
Q. Mr. President—Mr. President, if you can't protect critical infrastructure from a criminal actor, how can you possibly protect it from a state actor?
The President. We can do both, and we will.
Cyber Attack on Colonial Pipeline/Russia 
Q. Do you think Russia is involved at all, implicitly, with that attack?
The President. I'm going to have a—I'm going to be meeting with President Putin. And so far, there is no evidence based on—from our intelligence people that Russia is involved. Although there is evidence that the actors—ransomware—is in Russia. They have some responsibility to deal with this.
Thank you.
Q. Have you decided who will get the AstraZeneca doses, Mr. President?","NOTE: The President spoke at 1:44 p.m. in the East Room at the White House.
* White House correction.","Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on the National Economy and an Exchange With Reporters Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/349888 ",,,,,,,,,,,
7-May-21,Remarks on the National Economy and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon. It's exactly 12. [Laughter] I want to put today's jobs report in perspective. And look, when we came to office, we knew we were facing a once-in-a-century pandemic and a once-in-a-generation economic crisis. And we knew this wouldn't be a sprint, it would be a marathon.
Quite frankly, we are moving more rapidly than I thought we would. This morning we learned that our economy created 266,000 jobs in April. It hasn't been adjusted again yet, but that's what it says: 266.
And listening to commentators today—[laughter]—as I was getting dressed, you might think that we should be disappointed. But when we passed the American Rescue Plan, I want to remind everybody, it was designed to help us over the course of a year—not 60 days, a year. We never thought that, after the first 50 or 60 days, everything would be fine.
Today there's more evidence that our economy is moving in the right direction, but it's clear we have a long way to go. All told, our economy has added more than 1,500,000 new jobs since I took office. That's the most number of jobs created in the first 3 months of any Presidency in our history.
Just for perspective, in these 3 months before I got here, the economy added about 60,000 jobs a month, not half a million. In the 3 months since I've been here, the economy has added 500,000 jobs per month. And this is progress. And it's a testament to our new strategy of growing this economy from the bottom up and the middle out. And it's a clear testament to why it's so needed.
Some critics said that we didn't need the American Rescue Plan, that this economy would just heal itself. Today's report just underscores, in my view, how vital the actions we're taking are. Checks to people who are hurting. Support for small businesses, for childcare, and school reopening. Support to help families put food on the table. Our efforts are starting to work, but the climb is steep, and we still have a long way to go.
Today's report also puts some truth to some loose talk that we've been hearing about the economy lately. First, that we should stop helping workers and families out for fear of ""overheating"" the economy. This report reinforces the real truth: For years, working people and middle class people—the people who built this country—have been left out in the cold, struggling just to keep their heads above water while those at the top have done very well. We're still digging out of an economic collapse that cost us 22 million jobs. Let me say that again: It cost us 22 million jobs.
When we came in, we inherited a year of profound economic crisis and mismanagement on the virus. And we proposed a—and what we proposed is going to work. We're going to get to 70 percent. But, at any rate—but look, it's going to take focus, commitment, and time to get the economy moving again as we want it to move. We've got work to do, and the—to state the obvious, we have work to do.
But look, let's keep our eye on the ball. That's why the American Rescue Plan is so important. I said we built it as a yearlong effort to rescue our country. It's already working. Eight weeks later, we passed—it was—after it was passed, but parts of the bill are still getting underway.
Here's one example. I know you all know this, but it's worth repeating: State and local governments have to balance their budgets. As a consequence of this pandemic, revenues are way down in cities and States. State and local governments had to have—had to lay off 1.6 million employees. That's an awful lot of firefighters, police officers, sanitation workers, essential workers.
But later this month, we're going to be distributing the first tranche of the State and local assistance from the American Rescue Plan. We won't get all 1.6 million of those jobs back in one month, but you're going to start seeing those jobs and State and local workers coming back.
Starting this month, we'll also deliver assistance to tens of thousands—and this—I notice every Republican is up in their home State, talking about this being a good idea—tens of thousands of restaurants and bars across the country.
And by the way, the majority of the jobs that have come back have been in the entertainment—in the—in those industries, in the—and so, you know, we're going to help schools and children in child centers across the country as well, accelerate reopening, and that's underway. So look, this is going to continue to improve.
Today's report makes clear: Thank goodness we passed the American Rescue Plan. Help is here, and more help is on the way, and more help is needed.
Second, today's report is a rebuttal to the loose talk that the Americans just don't want to work. I know some employers are having trouble filling jobs. But what this report shows is that there's a much bigger problem, notwithstanding the commentary you might have heard this morning. It is that our economy still has 8 million fewer jobs than when this pandemic started.
The data shows that more workers—more workers—are looking for jobs, and many can't find them. While jobs are coming back, there are still millions of people out there looking for work. And the idea that they don't want to work—most middle-class, working-class people that I know think the way my dad did. He used to say—and I know I'm repeating myself, but I'm going to continue to, because I think it's critical—""A job is a lot more than a paycheck,"" he'd say. ""Joey, it's about your respect, your dignity, your place in the community."" More than a paycheck. It's people's pride. It's about being able to look at your child in the eye and say, ""Honey, it's going to be okay.""
I've never forgotten that. I've never forgotten those folks I grew up with. I think about them every day as President. They didn't have a lot of money, but they busted their necks their whole lives to take care of their families. And all they ever wanted was a shot—a fair shot—at making it. Last month, there were 266,000 more Americans with the dignity that comes from the job.
And there are millions—millions—of Americans out there who, through no fault of their own, have been knocked flat on their back this past year. The virus stole their jobs, and I'm determined to give them a fighting chance. That's why I've been so focused on vaccinating the Nation and getting our economy running again. That's why we fought so hard to pass the American Rescue Plan.
And again, the American Rescue Plan was for the whole year. It plays out over a year, and it's working. But we can't let up. This jobs report makes that clear, and we've got too much work to do.
And the American Rescue Plan is just that: a rescue plan. It's to get us back to where we were. But that's not nearly enough. We have to build back better. That's why we need the American Jobs Plan I proposed: to put us in a position where we can build back better, to reclaim our position as the leading and most innovative Nation in the world, and win the future, the 21st century.
We need to rebuild the Nation's roads and highways and bridges and ports and airports. We've got water systems all over the country that need repair. There are over 400,000 schools and daycare centers with lead pipes that—where the—the water goes through. Ten million homes. I saw a water project system yesterday in New Orleans that was over 80 years old. It's in need of major, major overhaul. And by the way, if they don't get it fixed, New Orleans itself is in real trouble.
They need reliable, affordable, high-speed internet throughout this country. Our businesses need to compete worldwide. Our rural communities need to be able to compete and make their own judgements as to when to buy and sell. And our kids need to succeed in school. As my wife Jill says, ""Any nation that outeducates us is going to outcompete us.""
We also need to up our game in our education system. Twelve years of education in the 20—in 2021 is not enough to compete in the 21st century. In my view, we need 16 years of public education guaranteed in this country from preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds at the early end, to 2 years of community college after high school.
We have some serious decisions to make and fundamental choices. And think about it: How much better off is the country if we have tens of thousands of graduating seniors from high school and beyond going to get 2 years of community college? Doesn't that increase our capacity significantly?
This month's jobs numbers show we're on the right track. We still have a long way to go. As I said, my laser focus is on growing the Nation's economy and creating jobs. My laser focus is on vaccinating our Nation. And we're making continued progress.
My laser focus is on one more thing: making sure working people in this country—hard-working people—are no longer left out in the cold. They're going to get a share on the benefits of a rising economy. It's been a long time since that happened.
I've called my plan the ""blue-collar blueprint for America,"" and that's exactly what it is. So let's not let up. We're still digging our way out of a very deep hole we were put in. No one should underestimate how tough this battle is.
We still have a job to do here in Washington. The American people are counting on us. So let's get it done. Let's build an economy that delivers dignity and gives everybody a chance.
I'm confident we can do this, because there is nothing beyond the capacity of the American people. I want to thank you, and God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you very much.
Unemployment Benefits 
Q. Mr. President, do you believe enhanced unemployment benefits had any effect on diminishing a return to work in some categories?
The President. No, nothing measurable. Thank you.
Q. And, Mr. President, do you——
Coronavirus Prevention Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, on CDC mask-wearing, I noticed you walked out to the podium with your mask on. Why do you choose to wear a mask so often when you're vaccinated and you're around other people who are vaccinated?
The President. Because I'm worried about you.
No, that's a joke. It's a joke. Why am I wearing the mask? Because, when we're inside, it's still good policy to wear the mask. That's why. When I'm outside—and the problem is: Lots of times, I walk away from this podium, you notice, I forget to put my mask back on because I'm used to not wearing it outside.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. Mr. President, are you at all concerned about Vladimir Putin amassing troops on the border of Ukraine? Do you see that as a message to you? And could it impact your desire to have a one-on-one meeting with him?
The President. It does not impact my desire to have the one-on-one meeting. And, you notice, he had more troops before. He's withdrawn troops. There's still troops amassed, but significantly less than he had a month ago. So——
Q. Mr. President, do you believe that the Iranians are——
Q. Do you expect that—do you expect that——
Iranian Nuclear Negotiations Vienna, Austria 
Q. Sorry. Mr. President, do you believe that the Iranians are serious about negotiation in Vienna?
The President. Yes. But how serious and what they're prepared to do is a different story. But they're—we're still talking.
Sir, you had a question. I had to cut you off.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. Do you have any update on whether you'll be able to meet Vladimir Putin in June? Is that going to happen?
The President. I'm confident we'll be able to do it. We don't have any—a specific time or place. That's being worked on.
Q. Has he agreed, sir?
The President. Thank you very much. Thank you.",NOTE: The President spoke at 12 p.m. in the East Room at the White House.,"Joseph R.

6-May-21,"Remarks on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation in Lake Charles, Louisiana","Well, Mr. Mayor, Governor, thank you. It's good to be back in Lake Charles. I've been here a number of times over the years as Senator and then as Vice President.
The first time I came down here—with a guy named Russell Long, who I served with—I was 29—please, sit down, everybody. I was 29 years old when I got elected, and I went to see Russell Long. And he said, ""Son""—I'd made my stops to all the senior Senators, which was what you do in those days—and I—he said: ""Son, sit down. Sit down."" And he pounded on his desk.
And I sat down, and he said—he said, ""How much money did you spend on your campaign?"" And I said, ""Well, sir""—and this is going to shock you. I said, ""About""—I said: ""A little over $285,000, but then I had to borrow some money and—to get through it. And I just won, barely, by less than a half a percentage point.""
And he said, ""Well""—he said, ""It's a good thing you won."" [Laughter] And I said, ""How is that?"" He said, ""Well""—he said, ""You've got yourself a $38,000 deficit."" [Laughter] And I said, ""Yes, sir."" And he said: ""Well, if you hadn't won, you'd just have a plain old deficit. Now you can have a deficit party."" [Laughter] God, I miss—he was amazing. An amazing guy.
And both of you are amazing. Mr. Mayor, you've got a great city. And as I said, I've been here—I've been here more than once, and it's good to be back. And I—it's hard to believe that—that you got hit as badly as you have within the timeframe you have. And I used to spend some time with Randy; he got hit a little bit, but not like you did—not like you have. And, Gov, you know, we have to build back. We have to build back better.
One of the things that—that I'm proud of is, in the first 100 days that I became President, we have created more jobs in that period of time than any administration in history. But the way I look at that, that's just the down payment getting us back with the American Recovery Act [Rescue Plan].* Just getting us back and getting people—a lot of that had to do with getting people vaccinated, getting 600 million doses of the vaccine, and getting people in a position where it was available.
But now it's about rebuilding America, rebuilding in a way that it has resilience. And the folks who are going to rebuild it are those folks right over there: unions. They're going to rebuild it in a way that we're going to provide good jobs.
Well, look, it's—as I said, it's good to be back, Governor Edwards and Mayor Hunter. And I also want to thank President Reine—the union president of AFL-CIO—head of the—there you are. I couldn't find you.
And, folks, there's a—when it comes to bridges and roads and the like, I've never seen a Republican or a Democrat road. I just see roads.
And, Mayor—I mean, you're a Republican. You wrote a newspaper article suggesting that we—along with the Governor—the Democratic mayor of Shreveport, Mayor Perkins—as to why we need the American Jobs Plan and—which is what I'm here to talk about today: a once-in-a-generation investment in American—America itself—to create jobs, to modernize our bridges, our roads, our highways, our ports, our airports, our water pipes, our water projects, high-speed internet, transmission lines, and sustainable housing—sustainable housing—jobs rebuilding the foundations of a strong, fair, and resilient—resilient—competitive economy.
You know, I know the times have been tough here. And the damage of the hurricanes has been devastating. The Governor has already spoken to me; we're talking with OMB and with our folks in—Republican and Democrats in the Congress, because I believe you need the help. I believe you need the help. We're going to try to make sure you get it.
But the people of Louisiana always have picked themselves up, just like America always picks itself up. There's no quit in America. There's no quit in Louisiana, as I've observed.
But that doesn't mean the Federal Government—because it was local, doesn't mean it shouldn't help. I promise you, we're going to help you build back better than ever and more resilient. And build back in a way that all we build is better able to withstand storms and—that are becoming more severe and more frequent than ever.
I think we have to—you might have noticed I promised I would have a—I would have a climate forum for the world in Washington within 100 days. Well, 40 Heads of State showed up, from the largest countries in the world to some of the smallest. We can't deny it: There is a real change in the weather. And if we go 1.5 degrees warmer, we're going to be in real trouble, at the point of no return.
Matter of fact, a lot of what we're going to have to build back now, in terms of infrastructure, we've got to build back to a different standard, not to what it was. It's got to be better because the climate has changed enough now that it's still going to rise 2 feet when the—when it rains. It's still going to—we've got to build for what is needed now. And I promise you, we're going to do that. And we're better prepared—so we're better prepared to withstand storms and—becoming more severe and more frequent.
We're standing here in the shadow of the I-10 bridge, which I've gone over several times myself in the past. And it's a perfect example of how we've neglected, as a nation, to invest in the future of our economy and the future of our people.
You know, when the bridge was built in 1952, it was built to—there was nothing there—it was built to make sure that we, in fact, are able to—it was going to last for 50 years; that was 20 years ago. It was built for 50 years.
The I-10 bridge was built to handle a daily traffic load of 37,000 crossings. Well—but, today, every day, more than 80,000—more than 80,000 cars and trucks cross over that bridge. And it doesn't have the modern safety features that bridges need to have now.
You know, six lanes of the interstate narrow into four lanes of a bridge. That's a recipe for disaster. And that's what—I'm sure you don't need to tell the drivers around Lake Charles that it means traffic bottlenecks and delays, and that they'll—at the last inspection, this bridge was characterized as in ""poor"" condition. And after decades of politicians studying it and talking about it, Governor Edwards is the one finally moving forward with a project to actually replace the bridge: one with six lanes, new interchanges, that's safer and reduces congestion.
And it shouldn't be as hard—it shouldn't be this hard to take so—or take so long to fix a bridge that's this important. It makes no sense. But the truth is, across the country, we have failed—we have failed—to properly invest in infrastructure for a half a century. The last 4 years, how many times did you say, ""This is going to be Infrastructure Week""? Well, I got so tired of hearing ""Infrastructure Week"" and nothing—nothing happened. Nothing has happened.
And across America, there are more than 45—hear me now—45,000 bridges that are structurally deficient. Structurally deficient. Every day, Americans cross these bridges 178 million times. And they are structurally deficient.
We've seen what happens when they deteriorate. Remember a few years ago? Two counties over the—in Mississippi had to shut down more than 60 bridges that were in poor condition. Sixty bridges. People in those communities were rerouted from 40 to 50 mile of detours with half-hour to hour delays.
One of the areas, when I was doing this with our last major plan that—when Barack was President—was in Pennsylvania. There was a large shopping center, a school, and the rest, and it was just across a creek, as we say up in that—that way.
And the bridge across it was deficient. But there was a fire station just within eyesight—from here to the other side—the parking lot. But guess what? When there was a burn, when there was a fire, it took them—they had to go up 9 miles to find a bridge, come back, and by that time, a hell of a lot of damage was done. Well, there are bridges all over America—big and small—like that.
A few years ago, as I said, we found ourselves in a position where it's not just more inconvenient, like in the situation in Mississippi, it is also a matter of life and death: keeping firefighters, paramedics from getting people help they need; cutting off hurricane evacuation routes.
In addition, more than 1 in 5 miles of our highways in the United States of America—major roads in America—are in poor condition—1 in 5 miles. That's more than a safety hazard. That is a drain on our economy.
The typical American pays—I know this is going to sound wonky, but it's real, and it affects ordinary Americans' lives, like the neighborhoods I come from—the typical American pays a hidden tax of more than $1,000 a year in the time it wastes and the fuel wasted due to traffic congestion because of the nature of our infrastructure.
We rank eighth in the world in terms of our infrastructure. We used to be the leader in the world. All told, these delays cost our country—according to economists—an estimated $160 billion a year in waste: extra fuel, extra time, and the like.
And that's due to the congestion. And folks in Louisiana know, there are much greater threats than just congestion. When the road or the bridge is washed out, or when it can't stand up to a hurricane, people can't get to their jobs, can't get to their schools. Families can't get to hospitals safely.
This is about creating jobs and also saving lives. You know, my mother used to have an expression, Gov, she'd say, ""Out of everything bad, Joey, something good will come if you look hard enough for it."" Well, one of the things that this crisis, in terms of the health crisis of COVID, has shown us is that we have to build back better in a whole series of ways.
It's about building a strong foundation for the American people. So when I think about the threats of hurricanes and global warming and—then the poor condition of our economy as it relates particularly to infrastructure, I think of one thing: I think of jobs. Jobs. Jobs.
Everything we're—gone through is now the, sort of—the blinders have been taken off the American people. They know how bad of shape things are in. But it creates—if we move—all the economists, including the liberal as well as conservative think tanks, point out what we'll create when we pass this Jobs Plan—we'll create up to 16 million good-paying jobs. Not $8 an hour or $12 an hour, not $15 an hour—prevailing wage jobs. Wages you can raise a family on. You have a—my dad would say just a little bit of ""breathing room"" after everything is paid.
And so, you know, your—this State is working to rebuild the I-10 bridge. But we can put America to work in every State, fixing roads and bridges that are in desperate need of repair.
My plan is a one-time, $115 billion investment above and beyond business as usual—what we usually do, everything in the Highway Trust Fund—this is above what we have spent in the past, so we can modernize bridges and roads and highways that need it most, putting people to work in good-paying jobs.
Now, I know a lot of you watching at home are thinking that—well, you know, if these jobs are for you. Well, you know, all you folks who feel left out as the economy is moving so rapidly, everything is changing, and you're wondering whether the—what you did before—is it going to be available to be done in the future? Well, let me tell you something: If you feel left out and forgotten in a rapidly changing economy, let me speak directly to you.
Nearly 90 percent of all the infrastructure jobs that this is going to create won't require a college degree. Seventy-five percent of them won't even require an associate's degree. These are jobs that can't be outsourced. Can't be outsourced. They just require something we've got in good supply here in Louisiana: hard work, grit, and sweat. Like the workers that are here today, and like all of the people you know and grew up with.
The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. A blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America, to supercharge our economy so we can move goods, get to work, become more competitive around the world. You know, it will shorten our commutes to give us back the lost time with our families, to make our commutes safer, save lives. All told, the American Jobs Plan is going to modernize 20,000 miles of highways and roads.
It will fix the Nation's 10 most economically significant bridges that require replacement—they're just not safe anymore, which this bridge could be one of them—and repairs 10,000 bridges that desperately need to be upgraded. Bridges that get kids to school, people to market.
And you know, when you build better roads or extend the train line over to the next town or install reliable, high-speed internet, it sparks new life and investment in communities. It gives people hope. Business picks up at the local convenience store, at the seafood market, at the hardware store where center—centers of people, locus in—and their jobs and their economies.
Better jobs start coming to town. We haven't seen that in a long time. Suddenly, young people don't have to make the decision whether they have to leave to have a better opportunity. They stay where they are.
That's what infrastructure does. It has a rippling effect. And when it makes all—when we make all these investments, we are going to make sure of one thing: that we buy American. Now, I know I'm being accused, when I say I'm only going to buy American as President, that somehow I'm going to violate trade agreements. No.
Since the 1930s, you're allowed to—a President could just decide to buy only American. It's not—it's just—I'm going to get to spend somewhere in the order of $600 billion this year—everything from building an aircraft carrier, new decks, and all. And I guarantee you one thing, and I've said it in place: Every single thing—from the deck of an aircraft carrier, to a railing in a new building—is going to be built by an American company, American workers, American supply chain so that we invest American tax dollars in American workers. And that's what we're going to do. I promise you.
Because right now that law has existed, but you're allowed to have exceptions. So what do you do? The last Presidents have come along and said, ""Well, we have a little trouble making sure we can find somebody who is able to put the railings in this new building and the stairwells."" Well, guess what? There's a whole hell of a lot of Americans who make that. So we're going to have a spot—you just call the White House. We'll find you any company that makes those railings, for example—as one concrete example—rather than going abroad to purchase those. It's going to create jobs and is going to generate economic growth.
And look, this is all about making a choice: a choice between giving tax breaks to the superwealthy and to corporations, and investing in working families, who are going to build the country. I look at this as—what I'm talking about—as giving, essentially, tax breaks to hard-working middle class and working people who built this country.
In my view, it's an easy choice: invest in workers wearing hard hats and doing the hard work of rebuilding the country and putting line workers—for example, to put line workers and electricians to work laying thousands of miles of transmission lines to build a modern energy grid; to put engineers and construction workers to work building modern roads and bridges, weatherizing homes and buildings, and setting new standards where they have to be built with better material and that have to be built to withstand heavy winds and hurricanes and the like and to withstand the impact of the changing weather; to put plumbers and pipefitters to work replacing a hundred percent of the Nation's lead pipes and service lines that are delivering poisoned water to our kids in the—there are over 400,000—400,000 schools in America that have lead pipes leading—I mean, 400,000—yes, that's right—400,000 have lead pipes going to the schools right now. And you have over 10 million homes where their water source is fed by lead pipes that were laid years and years ago.
We're going to rip it all up—all up—and make it safe all across America. And it's going to provide millions of jobs—thousands of jobs. And it's going to provide much more security. It's going to put plumbers and pipefitters to work replacing this so every child in America can turn on a faucet and not worry about drinking polluted water.
I'm going to be visiting a water plant in New Orleans today to get a closer look at what's needed to modernize the city's water system because it needs modernization, and they need it repaired.
Look, these are the highest value investments you can make as a nation, and they last the longest. Economists—left, right, and center—agree that these are the investments we need to make to generate historic economic growth that's maintained—maintained—not just bringing jobs back, but creating new jobs. And together, with the American Rescue Plan, the American Jobs Plan is going to help the economy create, as I said, estimated over 16 million good-paying jobs.
And, folks, we can't afford to not do it. We can't afford to not spend the time and effort and money.
Now, let me explain how we pay for this, because I'm not a deficit spender. Because, you know, we had a tax cut the other team put in back in nineteen—in 2017, and it created a $2 trillion deficit, with the vast majority of that going to the top 1—top one-tenth of 1 percent of the wage earners.
I don't want to punish anybody. You're entitled to be a millionaire or a billionaire, just pay your fair share. Just pay—for example, if we just were to make sure that we had the tax rate for the top rate in America for income tax—what it was in the Bush administration—it would go from 36 to 39.6 percent.
Well, guess what? That would raise a minimum of $10 billion a year. No one is hurt. Someone making that money is still going to have two homes or a jet plane—or these are mostly millionaires; they're not going to be hurting a little bit. But we're going to be able to put tens of thousands of kids in preschool and in free community college.
What's going to help America more? Increase the educational standard of all Americans so they have 14 years of school, from 2 years of—3- and 5-year-olds—3, 4, and 5 years old—we show that that happens if they get—not go to daycare, they go to school. No matter what the background or the home they come from, they catch up. Fifty-eight percent of them will go on to go to college; we know that now.
We also know that if you give 2 years—2 years—of free community college—you're in a situation where—you're in a position that you're going to have—in your State and every other State in America, you'll allow to go in the last 2 years—all of those credits are available to your State universities, and you can get a 4-year degree for half the cost. And/or you get the 2-year degree, and you're able to do what you needed it to do. It's estimated it will increase the average income by over 20 percent for someone in America for the rest of their lives.
So, folks, you know, the fact is that I'm—as I was saying, I'm not looking to punish anyone. You know, I come from the corporate State of the world, Delaware. More corporations are incorporated in the State of Delaware than every other State in the union combined.
But guess what? You know, I'm sick and tired of corporate America not paying their fair share. Their taxes used to be 38 percent—36 percent. We all thought that was too high, even in our administration, and we wanted to reduce it to 28 percent, make it more competitive. Some thought 24 [percent].* But it got reduced to 21 percent. And do you know what the result is? Of the largest corporations in America, 50 don't pay a penny in tax. They made $40 billion and don't pay a penny in tax.
If you're a construction worker and your wife is a schoolteacher, you're paying at a higher tax rate than corporate America is paying. Not a joke. Not a joke. I don't want to punish them.
And by the way, they used to do a lot more research and development. Major corporations, now, because we've changed the law—in fact, it used to be that a corporate CEO got paid 36 times as much as the average employee in their corporation in the Fortune 500; now, it's 456 times. My mother would say, ""Who died and left them boss?""
Well, 56 percent of all—53 percent of all of the money they made—excuse me—of a trillion dollars over 10 years—what did it do according to a major study? It went to buying back their stock. Now, why are you buying back the stock? Because CEOs now get paid in stock purchases—stock options. It used to be, they got paid in direct salary. And they get paid in stock options. So, if you have 10 shares of stock, you sell 5, the 5 left are worth more. You get paid in stock, you get—it's better.
The remaining 37 percent goes to dividends, which makes sense. But it leaves 9 percent—9 percent for everything, according to the study out of the University of Massachusetts—everything from salaries, employment, research, and development—9 percent.
So, folks, you know, we used to invest in research and development in this country in about 2.4 percent of all that we did, have—making us the leading country in the world in change and research and development. Well, we now do 0.7. The Chinese are eating our lunch. They're eating our lunch, economically. They're investing hundreds of billions of dollars in research and development.
That's why, right now, if it keeps their way, they're going to own the electric car market in the world. They're going to own a whole range—we've got to compete. We've got to compete. And it doesn't cost anybody anything and deprive anybody of anything they have earned or deserve.
As I said, we're now at a place where, when they used to pay 35 percent, it's now 21. The way I can pay for this is, the $40 billion, for example, just making sure the largest companies don't pay zero. And reducing the tax cut to between 25 and 28, it's a couple hundred billion dollars. We can pay for these things.
I'm not talking about deficit spending. I'm talking about paying for it. And I won't go—and I'm realizing getting too wonky, sharing and giving you too much detail. But the point is, what I'm proposing is badly needed and able to be paid for and still grow—trickle down ain't working very well, man. We've got to build from the bottom and—up and the middle out. That's how we build America. That's how we built it so well back in the sixties.
And so, folks, look, a middle class family, as I said, and a construction worker with a kid—with two kids is paying more in Federal taxes than a multimillion-dollar—billion-dollar corporation that's making billions of dollars, in terms of the rate at which they pay.
And look, here we go. You know, it's still—the fact is that the plans that I put forward meets the middle class and raises corporate rate. It also lowers it where—lower than any point that it was since World War II. And it's going to generate $90 billion each year, hundreds of thousands of jobs. We're going to put a lot of folks to work.
And by the way, how many of you are veterans or know—or have a brother, a sister, a mother, father who is a veteran? Well, here in Lake Charles, you've got a new veterans clinic. It was built a few years ago, beginning when Barack and I were in office. But most VA hospitals, for example, are 50 years old or older. Ask your buddies. Ask your buddies.
When they—we have more people, more veterans, and more active military committing suicide every week than are killed in all our wars. Why? Pick up a phone. We have more people coming back with posttraumatic stress than anything else.
I carry in my pocket my schedule. On the back of my schedule I have updates—U.S. troop updates: how many people have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. Not ""generally over 6,000""—six thousand, as of this morning, nine hundred and twenty-seven, because every single, solitary one of those fallen angels left an entire community behind. Wounded: 53,196—not ""roughly 53,000.""
Well, guess what? Ask your people—ask around in your State and any other State. You've got a husband, a wife calling, saying she's having posttraumatic stress, and she's stressed—""I need to get there—in there right away."" ""Well, we can't see you for 3 weeks. We don't have enough docs."" And the buildings are 15 years old—50 years old. We have a sacred obligation to invest in that infrastructure. Better docs—not ""better docs,"" more docs; more psychiatric nurses in order to take care of these things.
Look, folks, the bottom line here is—and I'm going on too long—the American Jobs Plan puts people to work upgrading VA hospitals and put—for our veterans and our servicemembers and military families.
And let me ask you: What's better for America—a tax cut that makes corporations richer and CEOs richer, or investments that are going to make our country stronger, more competitive, and lift up the standard of living for everybody?
And by the way, this is not punishing anybody. All those folks are still going to have two homes and three homes and their jets, and it won't matter. Not going to change their standard of living one little bit.
Not surprisingly, critics say they're worried that I'm going to stunt economic growth by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. There's just one problem with their argument: the facts.
Experts have looked at it. The last time taxes were around the rates I'm proposing was in the nineties, and the economy boomed. America created 20 million new jobs in 8 years when these were the tax rates. And the facts are, the American economy has had a record job creation and growth under the same kind of plan I'm proposing. And here's why: Our economy has always done best when everyone pays their fair share.
Again, I'm not looking to punish anybody. I'm looking to rebuild America as a world leader. I'm going to look to make sure we have the best and most significant infrastructure in the world. It's time to grow this economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
Let me close with this: Infrastructure has historically been a bipartisan undertaking. There's no reason it shouldn't be that way again, as the mayor is evidence of, and others are. It's about coming together to create jobs to make a more competitive world.
What's the first thing that anybody asks you when they want to put a new facility here in your city? ""How close is the interstate? And what—how—you know, what's the access to the lake? What's going—I mean, what's the water supply?"" They want to know you have the best infrastructure. Companies and corporations go where they can get their product made the quickest and get it to market the fastest.
And we're doing everything we can to win the competition for the 21st century. I'm willing to hear ideas from both sides. I'm meeting with my Republican friends up in the Congress to see, number one, how much they're willing to go for, what they think are the priorities, and what compromises we—I'm ready to compromise.
What I'm not ready to do: I'm not ready to do nothing. I'm not ready to have another period where America has another ""Infrastructure Month"" and doesn't change a damn thing.
America is more competitive, better, and more capable than any nation in the world. There's not a damn thing we cannot do when we do it together. It's about time we start working together, like mayors and local officials do, like Governors do.

5-May-21,Remarks on Implementation of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon. Earlier today I visited a restaurant here in town, Las—I'm going to mispronounce it—Las Gelameas [Gemelas].* And—which is a pilot program for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund and an important piece of the American Rescue Plan.
One of my goals with the American Rescue Plan is to make sure that we get this law's benefits quickly and directly to the American people. So before I say a bit more about what we're doing to support our Nation's restaurants, let me provide an update on what is happening through the American Rescue Plan right now, as I speak.
First, it's providing checks in pockets and shots in arms. More than 163 million rescue payments have already gone out. These are checks—direct payments of up to $1,400—that, for a typical family of four making about $110,000, means a $5,600 check you'll get. By the time all of the money is distributed, more than 85 percent of American households will have received a check.
The Rescue Plan is also funding vaccine administration and distribution. It's a big reason why we were able to administer over 220 million shots in my first 100 days, a pace unmatched by any other nation in the world or in prior mass vaccinations in all of American history.
You know, it's helped schools reopen safely. It's helping childcare centers stay in business. It's helping families pay for childcare. The Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger. And hunger is already sharply down in the United States.
It's also providing rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes, it's making health care more affordable, it's cutting child poverty in this country in half, and the list goes on. And the message is clear: Help is here.
And the bottom line is this: The American Rescue Plan is working. America is getting vaccinated. Job creation is soaring. The economy is growing. And our country is on the move again.
But some of the parts of the—of our economy need special help. At the top of that list is our Nation's restaurants. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, our Nation's restaurants were some of the first hit and the worst hit. In 2020, more than 2,300—excuse me, 2 million—2.3 million restaurant's jobs disappeared—2.3 million restaurant jobs disappeared.
Restaurants are more than a major driver of our economy, they're woven into the fabric of our communities. And so, for many families, restaurants are the gateway to opportunity, a key part of the American story. There are families of all races, all ethnic backgrounds, all nationalities in this country who have built their American Dream around a family-owned restaurant. And for more workers, their own story of economic progress starts in a restaurant.
In the restaurant I just visited, Rogelio Martinez, who immigrated to this country 17 years ago, started working as a meatpacker. Now he's the restaurant's lead butcher and one of its owners.
For nearly one in three Americans, a restaurant—this is hard to believe—but for one in three Americans, a restaurant provided their first job. More than half of all Americans have worked in a restaurant at some point in their lives.
Before the pandemic, restaurants and bars employed 12 percent—12 percent—of all the workers in our country. This is an industry that provided more opportunity for minority managers than any other industry in America. This is an industry where the staff feels like family and often is family.
When the pandemic hit, restaurant owners and operators were resilient, creative, and generous. Almost overnight, restaurants put in place safety measures to protect their employees and to protect us. They stepped up to feed our frontline workers. They changed their menus. They transitioned to takeout and delivery so they could be serving people who depended on them. But when—but even with the changes, many had to furlough or lay off workers or close entirely.
The restaurant I visited today went from 55 employees to just 7 before it started to bounce back. Now, as we vaccinate Americans, customers are coming back. And the vaccination—our vaccination progress and our economic recovery is going hand in hand. As that happens, we want to make sure that our restaurants, bars, and other dining establishments can staff back up and they can come back as well.
Right now only about a quarter of the restaurant owners expect to return to normal operations in the next 6 months. We can do much better than that with the American Rescue Plan. The Restaurant Revitalization Fund—that's what it's called, ""Revitalization Fund""—will provide direct relief to restaurants and to hard-hit food establishments: bars, bakeries, food stands, food trucks, and caterers.
Businesses that get grants can use it to cover payroll, rent, utilities, supplies, everything they need to start—to stay open and to reopen. We are—we're opening the doors of this program for—so that restaurants all over the country can open their doors again.
We start accepting—we started accepting applications on Monday. Today is Wednesday. We made it quick and easy to apply. Within the first 2 days, there were 186,200 applications from all 50 States for help. That's a staggering number.
Ninety-seven thousand—97,600 of those applications came from businesses owned by women, veterans, and socio-economically disadvantaged individuals. Now, the applications—they haven't—all haven't been processed yet. But right now it looks like we'll be able to provide help to about 100,000 restaurants and other eligible businesses. When we passed the American Rescue Plan—we did that—some people said it wasn't needed. This response proves them wrong; it's badly needed.
About a year ago, when the first round of the Paycheck Protection Program opened up, a lot of the smallest firms saw the doors shut in their face. The law was written so that as we process these applications—the new one—that we focus first on those who were left behind by the other relief programs.
And to make sure that relief is distributed fairly, we also set aside funds for the smallest restaurants—bars, food trucks, and many family-owned restaurants—that haven't gotten any help to date, and they need it. That way, they don't have to compete above their ""weight class"" for these grants. Sixty-one thousand—sorry for all the numbers, but they're important—61,700 applications have come from the smaller bars and restaurants already. And I want to thank the Small Business Administrator, Isabel Guzman, for the work that she and her team are doing to make sure we get help quickly and fairly to the businesses that need it the most.
As I said, I've spoken to dozens of restaurants' owners about the challenges they face. But I've also received letters from people who want to tell me about the restaurant owners in their communities. I received one letter from a man who asked me to look out for a pair of local restaurant owners who he described as, quote, ""the hardest working people I've ever met,"" end of quote.
Another letter was from a woman who wanted to tell me about how important the couple that ran the restaurant in her town near her was. She said they are, quote, the ""strong, consistent foundation of our community,"" end of quote.
Whether it's our economy or our sense of community, we're relying on restaurants to play a big role in our recovery. If we want our economy to recover in a way that deals everyone in, then our restaurants need a seat at the table—no pun intended. That's what we're giving them. That's what this program is about: a seat at the table.
This is another example of how we're putting the American Rescue Plan to work quickly and effectively and showing the American people that their Government can deliver—can deliver for them again and do it without waste; that we can vaccinate this Nation; that we can get our kids safely back in school; that we can get our economy back on track by helping hundreds of thousands of small businesses reopen and stay open; that we can give the people of this Nation a fighting chance again. That's what this is all about.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Q. President Biden, you said earlier——
World Trade Organization 
Q. President Biden, are you going to back the waiver of the U—at the WTO? Are you going to back that? Is the U.S. Government going to back that?
The President. Yes, I'm going to talk about that later today. Yes.
Republican Party Leadership 
Q. President Biden, you said earlier you ""don't understand Republicans."" [Laughter] What does it say about them if they oust Liz Cheney from leadership for telling the truth about the election?
The President. Look, it seems as though the Republican Party is trying to identify what it stands for. And they're in the midst of a significant, sort of, minirevolution going on in the Republican Party.
I've been a Democrat for a long time. We've gone through periods where we've had internal fights and disagreements. I don't ever remember any like this.
And so, as one of you said—and I'm not embarrassed by identifying them—as one of you said on national television last night, we badly need a Republican Party. We need a two-party system. It's not healthy to have a one-party system.
And I think the Republicans are further away from trying to figure out who they are and what they stand for than I thought they would be at this point.
Senate Minority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell/Bipartisanship/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/Tax Code Reform 
Q. Mr. President, Mitch McConnell said that he is 100-percent focused on stopping this administration. You've spoken about your relationship with him in the past. Do you still think you can work with him when he says things like that?
The President. Look, he said that in our last administration with Barack—he was going to stop everything—and I was able to get a lot done with him.
Again—look, everything I'm proposing that be done to generate economic growth, employment, and put us in a position where we can outcompete any other country in the world with research and development and moving ahead, I pay for. We talk about, ""I'd love""—we talk about how, ""This is going to cost so much money; I'm not paying for it.""
The bottom line is this: My Republican friends had no problem voting to pass a tax proposal that expires in 2025, that cost $2 trillion—none of it paid for—increased the deficit by $2 trillion; gave the overwhelming percentage of those tax breaks to people who didn't need it: the top one-tenth of 1 percent. They didn't need it.
And it was argued that what it would do is generate this great economic surge and growth. It would increase productivity. It would pay for itself. It would generate a sense of growth in America we hadn't seen ever before. Well, everyone from the Heritage Foundation on has pointed out it hasn't done that—hasn't done that.
Now, I come along and the proposals that I'm suggesting are tried-and-true things, like when you rebuild bridges, things get better; when you rebuild highways when you don't have to—you know, you—airports, ports—it all matters. It increases productivity.
And the programs that relate to people are programs that are the things that also generate economic growth. And I view them as, for example, tax cuts for middle class—upper-middle class, middle class—and working class people. And so you eliminate a few of the—just have the super wealthy begin to pay their fair share. For example, you have—you know, you have—I think it's 35 or 30 corporations didn't pay a single, solitary penny last year, and they're Fortune 500 companies. They made $400 billion. They paid no taxes.
How can that make any sense? Especially since these corporations—and I come from the corporate capital of the world; more corporations are incorporated in my State than all the rest of the country combined. If you notice, corporations aren't investing any money in research and development. Somewhere—what's most of it going to? Buying back their own stock; stock dividends, which makes sense—leaving, by some studies, less than 10 percent for research, development, pay raises, et cetera.
Used to be that, not too long ago—for example, during the Bush administration, the tax rate for the very wealthy—making well over millions of dollars—was 39.6 percent. It's now 37 percent. Just raise it back to what it was before.
It raises enough money from that savings to put every single person in community college who wants to go. Now, what's going to grow America more? What's going to help you and your security more: the superwealthy having to pay 3-point—almost, yes, 3.9-percent less tax or have an entire generation of Americans having associate degrees? That's why all the economists, even on Wall Street, are pointing it out. Guess what? It grows the economy. Benefits everybody. Hurts nobody.
But now, it's—talk to the—the Wall Street Journal—[inaudible]—talk about it: a welfare program. It's about growth. And so, you know, the idea that—it's just amazing. I mean, corporate taxes, they were 36 percent. Our administration—the last administration said, ""We should lower it."" We suggested it to be lowered to 28 percent. Well, it's got lowered to 20 percent or 21 percent.
Show me something that's benefited. What's happened? Show me where the growth is. What's it being invested in?
Yes.
Corporate Tax Rates/Education and Family Assistance Legislation/Tax Code Reform 
Q. Mr. President, on the corporate tax rate, have you talked to CEOs about that? I'm—and have you——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——have you—are you open to, say, 25 percent?
The President. I'm open to compromising, yes. It doesn't have to be exactly what I say, but to suggest that, which some of the folks are suggesting—and I'm going to meet with Republicans next week when they come back and seriously meet with them. I'm willing to compromise. But I'm not willing to not pay for what we're talking about. I'm not willing to deficit spend. They already have us $2 trillion in the hole.
So—and by the way, you saw—you know, the last five leaders of the Fed coming out and saying—what'd they say? They said, ""Biden's plan is going to grow the economy."" You have Moody's talking about increasing it up to—I don't know what the most recent one is—16 million new jobs. It's about growth, not stunting growth.
I think I said, not too long ago—I guess it was back in the 2000 range, there about—don't hold me to the exact year; I'll get—I'll have my staff come back with the exact date—the average CEO of the Fortune 500 companies makes like 36 times what the average employee of that corporation made. It's over 450 times as much now.
And, as my mother would say, ""Who died and left them boss?"" No, seriously. What rationale? Tell me what benefit flows from that. We're not going to deprive any of these executives their—that second or third home; travel privately by jet. It's not going to affect their standard of living at all, not a little tiny bit.
But I can affect the standard of living of the people I grew up with—if they have a job, I can expect to make—[inaudible]—standard of living of people I grew up with—if they have childcare and can afford it so 20 million women can be back in the workforce. This is just not—makes no sense to me.
But it's going to—I'm going to have to be able to explain this, and I'm going to keep banging at it. I think—I'm not being solicitous and I'm not trying to ruin your reputation. I think most of you understand what I'm saying—whether you agree with me or not, I think you understand what I'm saying. It's fair to say this is about making the average multimillionaire pay just a fair share. It's not going to affect their standard of living a little bit.
Thank you all very much.

4-May-21,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon. Today, 2 months until July 4, I'm here to report that we're in our vaccination program—where we are and what comes next—in an effort to get this country back closer to normal.
And first: Where are we? Well, as everyone knows, I promised that we'd administer 100 million shots in my first 100 days. After we met that goal, we doubled it to a historic 200 million shots. By the time we reached 100 days last week, we had shattered that mark with over 220 million shots in arms.
And, as we stand here today, almost 150 million Americans have gotten at least one shot. Over 105 million Americans are fully vaccinated. And among our most vulnerable population—seniors—we are nearing 85 percent of those who have gotten their first shot. Seventy percent of the seniors are now fully vaccinated. It's a dramatic turnaround from where we were in January, when less than 2 percent of adults and less than 1 percent of seniors were fully vaccinated.
Not only that, cases are down in 40 States these past 2 weeks. Deaths are down dramatically since January, down over 80 percent among seniors, which includes a drop among Hispanics of 80 percent and among African Americans of 70 percent of seniors.
There are tens of thousands of Americans alive today because—who would not be alive otherwise were they not—had access to rapid vaccination program. Moms and dads, sisters and brothers, grandparents, neighbors, old friends—they're around now, and God—thank God for that.
Now, where do we go from here? Well, as we anticipated, the pace of vaccinations is slowing now that the majority of American adults have already gotten their first shot. But we are still vaccinating millions of Americans every day.
In fact, in the last 10 days, 1 out of every 10 adult Americans got a shot. But, soon, we'll have reached the adults who are most eager to get vaccinated, and, at that point, this effort will shift to a new phase, which is what I want to talk about today.
Our new phase will focus on three areas. First, kids, children between the ages of 12 and 15 years of age. They are not yet eligible for a vaccine. The FDA's scientists are currently reviewing the data to decide if—if and when—to authorize that age range for vaccinations. The FDA—and the FDA alone—will make that decision.
But today I want American parents to know that if that announcement comes, we are ready to move immediately—immediately move to make about 20,000 pharmacy sites across the country ready to vaccinate those adolescents as soon as the FDA grants its okay.
Now, most Americans have a vaccination site about as close as their house is near to a neighborhood school. We're also going to slip vaccines directly to pediatricians—ship them to pediatricians during the following weeks. So parents and their children can talk to their family doctor about it and get the shot from a provider they trust the most: easy, fast, and free.
And if teens are on the move this summer, they can get their first shot in one place and the second shot elsewhere. We know that adolescents are at risk from COVID-19. Though serious illness at that age range is rare, they can still get sick and spread the virus to others. So my hope is that if the vaccine is authorized, parents will take advantage of it and get their kids vaccinated.
The second area of focus is making it more convenient for everyone to get a vaccine. We know that many adults have not been vaccinated because they have found it too confusing or too difficult or too inconvenient to get a shot.
So for those having trouble finding a location or making an appointment, we're going to make it easier than ever. We have formally launched a simple website where you can find a vaccination location closest to you. That site is vaccines.gov. Let me say it again, vaccines.gov. Go there now, find a location to get the shot, and make an appointment.
Also today, if you prefer texting, we have another easy way to get the shot. Text your ZIP Code to the following number: 438829. Your ZIP Code to that number: 438829. And you will get a text back with the location that is nearest to you with vaccines in stock right then and there. Yes, you can text your ZIP Code right now to 438829 and get texted back within minutes with the place that's nearest to you to get a vaccination that are available immediately.
So send this to your kids, your grandkids, your friends who have not been vaccinated yet.
Now, I know some people find making an appointment in advance inconvenient. So, starting this week, we are also going to direct all Federal pharmacy partners to begin to provide walk-in hours. You'll soon be able to get vaccinated without an appointment at the vast majority of our 40,000 pharmacy locations across the country.
We also are encouraging our State and local partners to have a walk-in ability as well to the sites that they run. And beginning next week, we'll be shipping new allocations of vaccine to rural health clinics, getting more vaccines to more rural clinics so Americans who don't live near one of those 75,000 vaccination sites will have new options that may be closer than anything they thought.
We know that vaccination rates are lower in rural areas, and that's why we're going to get vaccines closer than ever to rural residents. Also, as we wind down the large mass vaccination sites, we'll move towards smaller locations even more convenient to the unvaccinated. So, for those who don't want to drive the distance to a large vaccination site, we will have sites—smaller sites—closer to the unvaccinated.
And for the first 100 days, our goal will be to make it possible for people to come and get vaccinated, and we'll succeed beyond anyone's expectations, I believe. Now we are going to have to bring the vaccine to people who are less eager. So we also know that there are millions of Americans who just need a little bit of encouragement to get the shot.
I recently called on employers to do their part by offering paid time off for employees to get vaccinated and opening up a tax credit program that reimburses the businesses for the cost of giving the employee the time off to get vaccinated. And I want to thank the 1,000 businesses that have stepped up so far.
We're also going to roll out new partnerships with the business community. We're working with major businesses, like grocery stores, to provide special deals like discounts to shoppers who come to their stores to get vaccinated. The—and it works both ways. Bring them in to get vaccinated, but when they're in, they will get discounts to purchase goods in that store.
Further, we're working with major sports leagues to launch special promotions for their fans: things like ticket giveaways, in-stadium vaccination programs, discounts on merchandise, and other creative ways to make it easier and more fun to get vaccinated. Now, I'm making it sound more fun to get vaccinated, but it doesn't hurt to get vaccinated. I'm not saying it's fun, but they'll be able to have other things available to them besides being protected from the virus.
Let me repeat: We're going to make it easier than ever to get vaccinated. Visit vaccines.gov—vaccines.gov. Or text to—your—text your ZIP Code to: 438829—438829. Walk into your local pharmacy without an appointment. Go to the doctor or a local health clinic. It's free. It's nearby. Every adult is eligible. You know, go get the shot as soon as you can.
The third area of our focus is Americans who still aren't sure they want to get vaccinated. We've seen the confidence in vaccines rise steadily these past few months among virtually every segment of the population.
And as more and more Americans see their friends and family get vaccinated, they're making the choice to get vaccinated themselves. Democrats and Republicans, progressives, conservatives, people of all persuasions are getting vaccinated. In fact—the fact is that nearly 85 percent of seniors have had at least one vaccination shot, and the wide cross-section of the Nation trust the vaccine regardless of race or ideology.
Now we need to make that same progress for those under 65 years of age. There are a lot of younger people, especially those in their twenties and thirties, who believe they don't need it. Well, I want to be absolutely clear: You do need to get vaccinated. Getting vaccinated not only protects you, it also reduces the risk that you give the virus to somebody else. It could save your life or the lives of people you love.
We're still losing hundreds of Americans under 65 years of age every week, and many more are getting seriously ill from long stretches of the time. Look, even if your chance—even if your chance—of getting seriously ill is low, why take the risk when you have a safe, free, and convenient way to prevent it?
Additionally, we know that some people may need more information to decide whether to get the vaccine. There is now plenty of information for people to do their homework within nearly 150 Americans living—in fact, with 150 million Americans that are living now have gotten the vaccine.
Talk to someone you trust like your physician or your pharmacist or people who have already been vaccinated. Talk to your faith leaders or others in your community that you trust. Look to those people to help answer your questions.
I want to be clear. I've been saying this a long time, but I really believe it: This is not a Democrat or a Republican issue. Science behind the vaccines has been under development for decades. Two of our vaccines were authorized under prior administrations, Republican administrations. My administration—a Democratic administration—is doing the work to get hundreds of millions of shots in arms. While we may not always agree on everything, this is one thing people across the political spectrum can agree on.
So, I want to thank the prominent conservatives, like Mitch McConnell, and a large group of Republican Members of Congress who have medical training, who have advanced getting vaccinated. I also want to thank the 105 million Americans of every background who are fully protected from one of the deadliest pandemics in our history.
You know, there's a lot of misinformation out there. But there's one fact I want every American to know: People who are not fully vaccinated can still die every day from COVID-19. Look at the folks in your community who have gotten vaccinated and are getting back to living their lives—their full lives. Look at the grandparents united with their grandchildren, the friends getting together again. This is your choice. It's life and death.
And I hope everyone knows within themselves, it makes the choice that will—it's going to help them and their loved ones be safe, get our businesses open again, and get us back to normal.
Again, in the next 2 months, our focus is going to be on three groups: kids between 12 and 15 who are awaiting potential FDA authorization to get a shot; two, adults who have had trouble locating a place to get a shot or who just haven't gotten around to it; and three, those who need more convincing—being convinced of the necessity of getting the vaccine.
As we turn to this new phase, we're also setting a new goal. Two months from today—2 months from today—families across the country are going to celebrate the Fourth of July. Our goal by July 4 is to have 70 percent of adult Americans with at least one shot and 160 million Americans fully vaccinated.
That means giving close to 100 million shots—some first shots, others second shots—over the next 60 days. Of course, Americans can still get shots after July 4, but no one should wait. And let's try to hit that 70-percent mark at least with one shot before that day. It's another huge goal.
And as you may remember, we were initially focused on getting enough vaccines for every adult. Well, we did that. We have enough vaccines. Now that we have the vaccine supply, we're focused on convincing even more Americans to show up and get the vaccine that is available to them.
If we succeed in this effort, as we did with the last, then Americans will have taken a serious step towards a return to normal: That's July 4. But we're not there yet. That's why I'm asking people to continue to follow the CCD guidelines—CDC guidelines as we work to get more people vaccinated. And to clear up any confusion, the good news is that, last week, the CDC said that vaccinated people do not need to wear their masks outside unless they're at very crowded settings like a sporting event.
And if we can continue to drive vaccinations up and caseloads down, we'll need our masks even less and less. I know it will take time to get everyone back to—everything back to normal. You know, we're all going to have to be patient with one another. Masks have needlessly divided this country. Masking as directed is a patriotic duty, but so too is treating each other with respect and patience.
One final point: As I said in my address to Congress last week, Congress [America]* is going to be ""the arsenal"" for fighting COVID-19, just like we were for—the arsenal for democracy in World War II, not only because it will have kept us safe, but because of—it's who we are.
Well, we're—we've already committed to work to send 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine to other countries, starting this month and into June. That means, of all the vaccines we've produced for the United States at that time, we'll have given about 10 percent to the rest of the world. It's a significant humanitarian commitment, in addition to our funding of COVAX. And I'll have more to say about that soon.
I'll conclude with this: The light at the end of the tunnel is actually growing brighter and brighter. So Americans have sacrificed and served to make this progress possible, showing the best of who we are as a people. We need you—we need you—to bring it home. Get vaccinated.
In 2 months, let's celebrate our independence as a nation and our independence from this virus. We can do this. We will do this.
Thank you all, may God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
[At this point, several reporters asked questions at once.]
Q. Mr. President—[inaudible]—to help India? Mr. President——
Q. Mr. President, how much harder will this next phase be for the vaccination campaign?
The President. I'm sorry. You were both speaking. One at a time.
U.S. Supply of COVID-19 Vaccine Overseas 
Q. Mr. President, where are you sending the AstraZeneca doses first? What will be the criteria? Countries like India or Brazil that needs the most, or would it be to——
The President. We're helping Brazil; we're helping India significantly. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi. What he needs most is he needs the material and the parts to be able to have his machines that can make the vaccine work. We're sending them that. We're sending them oxygen. We're sending them a lot of the precursors. So we're doing a lot for India.
With regard——
Q. How about Brazil?
The President. Let me finish. With regard to the AstraZeneca vaccine, which we had, we have sent that vaccine to Canada and to Mexico. And there are other countries that we're talking to now. As a matter of fact, I talked to a head of state today.
I'm not prepared to announce who else we'll be—we'll be giving the vaccine to. But we are going to, by the Fourth of July, have sent about 10 percent of what we have to other nations, including some of the ones you mentioned.
Q. Are you sending to Brazil? 
Q. If this phase—if this phase is not successful——
Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Q. How much harder will this next phase be for the administration? How much harder compared to the first 100 days?
The President. Well, I think, in one sense, it's easier in that it's up to convincing the American people rather than guaranteeing them we'd have the supply for them. So that was really hard. It was really hard to get from, you know, as that old expression, 0 to 60 miles an hour to—it was get—very hard to get from a very low count to 600 million vaccines and then set up all of the logistics.
But I think what's going to happen—this is my prayer—that more and more people who get vaccinated are going to be listening to people who they love and are around, and they're going to say, ""Why don't you just go ahead and do it?"" And there's some evidence, we still had a good dose of vaccine being administered the last 2 weeks, and it's still moving.
But we know we're going to get to a place where the doubters exist or the people who just are—I don't want to say ""lazy""—just not sure how to get to where they want to go. It's going to be hard. So we're going to keep at it. We're going to keep at it.
And, I think, at the end of the day, most people will be convinced by the fact that their failure to get the vaccine may cause other people to get sick and maybe die. And——
Q. Mr. President, if this phase——
The President. Let me finish here. Okay? I promise I'll get to you.
Q. Okay.
The President. Okay?
And so it's—in one sense, it's harder—I mean, it's easier because I don't have to put together this massive logistical effort. But in the other sense, it's harder; it's beyond my personal control. I could—not ""control""—but I could arrange and make sure those other things happened if we did it well, and I think we did. But it's going to be harder.
Yes, ma'am.
Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Q. Thank you. If this phase is not successful, are there any circumstances under which you would require the vaccine for people to do certain things, like travel? And, if not, what more can you do beyond this?
The President. Well, I'm not going to—you know, I'm one of these guys who thinks positively and not negatively. [Laughter] So there's more that we can do. One of the things we can do is we can continue to produce more of the vaccine, work harder to get it available to more people, and export a lot of that to help.
Secondly, whether we're going to—I think that we're going to continue to—I don't think—we're going to continue to try to bring in—an, effectively, spokespersons who represent communities that, in fact, people listen to. And it's going to get more granular, I think, rather than large. The likelihood of us being able to get, you know, 100,000 vaccinations in a week at a major site is getting harder and harder. There's—those people desperately wanted to get the vaccine.
So we'll—I think we're going to make some real progress here. We'll see. But we're going to keep at it.
Q. [Inaudible]—Putin——
Coronavirus Vaccine Supply 
Q. Can you say whether you've spoken—can you say whether you've spoken to your Trade Representative?
The President. Say it again?
Q. Can you say whether you've spoken to your Trade Representative yet, Katherine Tai, about the issue of issuing waivers on vaccine patents? Is that something you would support?
The President. Well, we're going to decide that as we go along. I haven't made that decision yet.
Q. Okay. Would you consider ordering more doses from Pfizer and Moderna?
The President. We are.
Q. You've already ordered 100 million more from each. Would you order, additionally, on top of that?
The President. The answer is: We're going to—as long as there is a problem anywhere in the world, even if we solve it here—we're going to move as quickly as we can to get as many doses of Moderna and Pfizer as possibly can be produced and export those around the world.
Yes, ma'am. This is the last question.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. Mr. President, thank you. Are you planning to meet President Putin during your trip—your upcoming trip in Europe? Is there a meeting that you're planning to have with him?
The President. With who?
Q. With President Putin.
The President. That is my hope and expectation. We're working on it.
Q. Can I just follow up, Mr. President?
The President. Thank you.
Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, why can't you go higher for vaccinations? The U.S. is currently administering about a million first doses per day. Thirty-five million—you'd need about 35 million new people to hit 70 percent. Why not set that target for 75 percent or 80 percent of the public?
The President. Well, I'd like to get it at 100 percent. But I think, realistically, we can get to that place between now and July 4.
And by the way, it's not like July 4, the doors close. [Laughter] It's just, I picked July 4 to try to get to a place where we get back closer to normal. And so we're going to be vaccinating people into next fall. It's not going to—this is not going to—something that, all of a sudden, July 4, we're going to just declare it's over.
Thank you so much.

3-May-21,"Remarks on Education and Family Assistance Legislation at Tidewater Community College-Portsmouth Campus in Portsmouth, Virginia, and an Exchange With Reporters","The President. My name is Joe Biden. I'm Jill's husband. [Laughter] And just like the lovely lady in blue over here is a professor at a community college, my wife also works for your husband. [Laughter] I—and thank you for the warm welcome today at the airport. Appreciate it very, very much.
And Tim Kaine, one of the great Senators and great, great friend. And a guy I've relied on most of my career—when I was in the Senate, we worked together; and as Vice President; and now—is Bobby Scott. Bobby, thank you for everything you do. And, Congresswoman Luria, we even got to meet when you were in uniform, I think, if I'm not mistaken. And you're doing a great job, and thank you for being here.
And to all the faculty and the management and the folks here at the community college.
You know, one of the things that I really found interesting, Jaiden, is that—the major you took—cybersecurity. We spent a lot of time, as my colleagues in the Congress and the Senate can tell you, worrying and dealing on—with cybersecurity. And it's really important that—now that we get this under control. And we have the best trained people in the world, and you're going to be among them.
And I'm here today at Tidewater Community College to talk about the America's Family Plan and—that I announced last week—a once-in-a-generation investment in our families, in our children that addresses what people care most about and most need—the investment we need to win the competition—the competition with other nations in the future. Because we're in a race. We're in a race.
It all starts with access to a good education, as you all know. When America made 12 years of public education universal in America in the early 1900s, it made us the best educated nation in the world, and you saw the benefits that came from that. But the rest of the world has caught up to us. The rest of the world has caught up to us. They are not waiting. And 12 years is no longer enough to compete with the world in the 21st century and lead the 21st century.
That's why my American Families Plan guarantees 4 additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.
We were at an elementary school earlier today. And what we're talking about here is—it means universal, high-quality preschool—for 3- and 4-year-olds—not daycare, preschool. And the research has shown, here at the great universities in this State and others, that children of that age who go to school, they are far more likely to graduate from high school and continue their education beyond that, rather than start off behind the eight ball if they come from families that are not—don't have educations—college educations.
You know, a lot of kids start kindergarten hearing a million fewer words having spoken than other families, and it's an unfair disadvantage. But every child is capable. Every child is capable of learning.
So we just visited, by the way, a fifth-grade classroom in Yorktown earlier today, where the students are—back together with their classmates and teachers in school. And we saw what's—what being in school means for those kids.
Safely reopening the majority of the K-through-8 schools was one of my top priorities in my first 100 days, because there's so much that happens when they don't have the certitude and the companionship and the familiarity of being with their friends. There's an awful lot of need in this pandemic for mental health facilities and counseling.
And we met that goal by working with the Governor here to get educators and school staff vaccinated and to get them the resources they needed to open up safely.
And I've often said that children are the kite strings that keep our national ambitions aloft. We say ""all those kids,"" but they're all our children. They're all our children. And they are the kite strings that literally lift our national ambitions aloft. So we've got to invest in them—invest in our children—to invest in the future.
And we can't stop there. We're going to add 2 years of community college on top of that. You just heard Jill talk about how community colleges and how it can change lives. Well, students here, at the community colleges across the country, know why.
For some, it's 2 years of community college to earn enough credits to transfer to a 4-year university—which is available almost in every single State—to become a teacher, an entrepreneur, or anything else. For some, it's getting extra training through a certificate program to get a good-paying job and a business in town.
We just met with the students at the HVAC workshop, ambitious, talented students, who are up to taking the next step in their lives. And with the skills they're learning here—and some of the students will go on to be plumbers and members of the Pipefitters Local 110, electricians—look, it means higher union wages with guaranteed health care and pensions.
And you know, it's kind of amazing—one of the things—I don't know if you know—the First Lady of this State understands; she does, I'm positive—that an awful lot of folks who even get an opportunity to go to community college still can't get there because of food, transportation, and those other costs. And so we're going to increase Pell Grants so they'll qualify—every—no, it would make a gigantic difference. It will make a gigantic difference.
By the way, I have to admit: If I didn't have these positions, I'd be sleeping in the Lincoln bedroom—[laughter]—rather than the Vice—the President's bedroom. [Laughter] But it really—you know, it really is how to start to transform a life and family and community and our economy: by investing—investing in the people.
Every child has a capacity to learn. And I've—if I've heard it once, I've heard from Jill a thousand times: ""Joe, any country that outeducates us will outcompete us."" And that's a fact. And she'll be deeply involved in leading this effort as well.
The second thing: The American Families Plan is going to provide access to quality, affordable childcare, keeping parents—helping parents go back to work, providing a lifeline and benefits for children as they do better in school throughout their lives.
You know, it guarantees low- and middle-income families pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. And that makes a gigantic difference. There's millions of women out of work today not, because they're not qualified for the jobs they have, but they can't take care of their children and do their job. And the cost of childcare is extraordinary.
I was a single father when I first got elected to the Senate. I had two young boys raised after their mom and sister were killed, and I've—had I not had the family I had, I'd never been able to do it. And I'm not joking about that. And I was a Senator; I was making a decent salary.
The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime if in fact my plan works. If you're low-income folks, you'll be able to get childcare for free.
Third, the American Families Plan is going to finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid and medical leave—paid family and medical leave. We're one of the few industrialized countries in the entire world that doesn't have this feature. No one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck or taking care of themselves, their parent, their spouse, or a child that's ill. They should have that opportunity.
And the fourth piece of the plan: The American Families Plan puts money directly in the pockets of millions of Americans. In March, we extended the tax credit for low- and middle-income families with children.
Now, if I could hold a second here, what—you know, if you have—make enough money and you're paying taxes, you end up in a situation where you get to deduct $2,000 per child—as a tax benefit. You don't get it back, but you get to deduct it.
Well, if you're a minimum-wage worker, you're not paying much tax. And if you're making less than that, which many people are, you're not paying any Federal tax. So you get no benefit.
So we put in place—and a number of my Republican colleagues shared the view too—although none on the voting floor—but they—but I think they share it as well—and that is: Up to $3,000 per child, 6 years and older; and $3,600 for a child that is over 6 years—under 6 years of age. That means two parents and two young kids with—they get a check back from the Government for $7,200 in their pockets, which they're doing now, which can help them take care of your family. And it will benefit more than 65 million children. And all the data shows it will cut child poverty in half this year—cut it in half.
My plan extends the tax credit at least through the year 2025. Because what's going to happen in 2025, as the press knows, is the tax cuts of the last President expire. And we're going go back—that put us $2 trillion in debt. And then, we're going to compete as to what tax credits there are. I think it's about time we start giving tax breaks and tax credits to working class families and middle class families instead of just the very wealthy.
And here's what the American Families Plan doesn't do: It doesn't add a single penny to our deficit. It's paid for by making sure corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent just pay their fair share. I come from the corporate capital of the world. More corporations are incorporated in the State of Delaware than all the rest of the Nation combined. And I'm not anticorporate, but it's about time they start paying their fair share.
It's about making a choice. You know, we have out there—this year, you had 50 corporations—make, you know, $40 billion—that didn't pay a single penny in taxes. Not a single penny. I don't want to punish anybody, but everybody should chip in. Everybody should pay something along the road here.
The choice is about who the economy serves. And so I plan on giving tax breaks to the working class folks and making everybody pay their fair share.
Here's an example of that choice: If you ask the top 1 percent to pay the same tax rate they paid in 2001, when George Bush was President, that would generate $13 billion a year. Now, that's enough for us to take around $11 [billion]* of that $13 billion and provide for 2 years of community college free for every student in America.
So what's fair? Go from 36 to 39.6 percent, like it used to be, and be able to take care of ever—what's better? Just think about it in terms of what's better for America—not Democrat, Republican, Independent—what's going to grow America more? What's going to grow America more? What's going to make us more competitive, stronger? What's going to make us better educated?
So, for folks at home, I'd like to ask a question: Do we want to give the wealthiest people in America another tax cut? Or do you want to give every high school graduate the ability to earn a community college degree on their way to good-paying jobs or on their way to 4 years of school in industries of the future—health care, IT, cybersecurity, you name it?
Look, another example: For too long, we've had a two-tiered tax system. Working families pay taxes they owe on the wages they earn, while some of the wealthiest Americans avoid paying anything close to that fair share.
My plan revitalizes and—the capacity of the IRS to crack down on—there's a number of studies, from the former Secretary of Treasury on, that millionaires and billionaires are able to avoid taxes and cheat in avoiding those taxes because we have so few agents in the IRS.
It's—the consensus is, if you increase the disclosure requirements for banks and financial institutions on accounts for the wealthiest Americans to reduce tax cheating, you will have two steps—two steps would recover $70 billion per year that currently goes unreported and unpaid.
Now—and we've been hearing about this for the last 10 years. Instead of cutting a number of agents, we should be increasing the number of agents—not hounding anyone, just being able to get access to information. And shut down all the tax havens from the islands to—anyway, I won't go into it. I can get a little carried away with this.
But look—and we can take this money—this money and pay for universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old in America. So what is better? Making people just pay their fair share. Paid family leave. Childcare costs of working families, maximum of 7 percent of their income.
Again, it's a choice. It's more important to shield millionaires from paying their fair share? Or is it more important that every child gets a real opportunity to succeed from an early age and ease the burden on working families?
Third, we have a loophole in our tax system called ""stepped-up basis."" It's also known as the trust fund loophole. For example, if I had a million dollars in stock that I bought, and it made a million dollars and I was going to cash it in, I'd have to pay capital gain on that million dollars.
But if, God forbid, on the way—go back to where I was—on the way to where we're talking about—on the way to cash in my stock, I got hit by a car and got killed, I can leave it to my daughter, and she pays no tax, a tax that was owed 2 seconds earlier.
It's not an inheritance tax. It was a tax was owed 2 seconds earlier. But that's what ""stepped-up basis"" means. It's a person passes away and leaves the stock in their—to their son or daughter; son or daughter don't have to pay anything on that multimillion-dollar gain when they sell that stock. And that's worth a lot of money.
Look, they may be decent and honorable people—and they are—but the last thing Americans with around—with the amount of wealth—needs is another tax break.
We need to make a choice to eliminate the loophole—only the gains above for people—only the gains above people making $2 million a year—or, excuse me, a couple—a rate of [raise of]* capital gains rate for people making more than a million dollars a year, which, by the way, would affect three-tenths of 1 percent of all taxpayers—three-tenths of 1 percent of the top 1 percent.
And close another loophole, like the real estate investor loophole, where the wealthy is simply paying the same rate on their wages and investment income. That raises $40 billion a year for the next 10 years.
The reason I'm bothering to do this is, I keep hearing out in the press, ""Biden is going to raise your taxes."" Anybody making less than $400,000 a year will not pay a single penny in taxes. And we will not increase the deficit either, unlike the last gigantic tax cut, which increased the deficit by $2 trillion.
It's about balancing the system and growing the economy. It means wealthy investors no longer pay lower marginal tax rates than their secretary pays—the secretary in their office.
Do you want to know what that would do? That would take that money and extend the lifechanging middle class tax cut and put it in place for American Rescue Plan and expand childcare tax credit—I mentioned earlier, that's $1,700 [$7,200]* in the pockets of a family with two kids for—now through—through 2025. Look, just closing these loopholes by taxing investment income at the same rate we—for—as wages for the wealthiest Americans, we'd have enough to extend this again through 2025.
So I ask again: Is it more important to keep these tax loopholes for millionaires—who are good people; they're not bad folks, but—or would we rather put $7,200 in the pockets of working moms and dads every year if they have two children?
Folks, trickle-down economies—economics has never worked. For too long, we've had an economy that gives every break in the world to the folks who need it the least. It's time to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
We can choose to give hard-working families a break—a tax break, in effect. We can choose to invest in our students. We can choose an economy that rewards work, not just wealth, and that chooses—the choice I'm making and the vast majority of the American people support is: Let's give people a shot. Given even half a chance, the American people have never, ever, ever let their country down. Imagine if we give them a full chance. Imagine what it would mean for them and their families and for our country.
We're the United States of America. There's nothing—nothing—we've been unable to do when we do it together. So let's get together. Let's get this done. Because the truth of the matter is that we can do this and grow the economy. I won't go into all the other statistics, but the plan is estimated to grow the economy another trillion dollars. This will grow the economy. Everybody would be better off.
So I want to thank you all for doing your part here to make sure that not only you're educating and giving people a real shot—a real shot—at a real life, consistent with their talents and their capacities, not limit it because they don't have the money. And we're going to give it to a lot more people.
I promise you—I promise you—America will be much stronger for it. Because, like I said, if we're setting out a universal education, it wouldn't just be 12 years anymore. It would be—it would be those 14 years—16 years I'm talking about: 2 to start, and 2 at the other end.
And as your State has done under your Governor and your Senator and your Congresspersons, your State—if you got—if you get 4 years out of here—2 years out here, that's 2 years towards a State university. You cut tuition in half for a 4-year degree as well.
So there's an awful lot of possibilities, an awful lot of hope. And the good news is, I think there's overwhelming, bipartisan support for this. You look at the polling data: Republican voters overwhelmingly support it. Now I just got to get some of my Republican colleagues to support it.
So thank you all, and God bless you. And thank you for the work you're doing. And may God protect our troops. Thank you so much.
Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, when do you think the U.S. will reach herd immunity? When do you believe the U.S. will reach herd immunity?
The President. I think, by the end of the summer, we'll be in a very different position than we are now. As you know, I've worked very hard to make sure we have over 600 million doses of vaccine.
We're going to continue to make sure that's available. We're going to increase that number across the board as well so we can also be helping other nations once we take care of all Americans.
And what's happening now is, all the talk about how people were not going to get shots, they were not going to be involved—look at what that was—we were told that was most likely to be among people over 65 years of age. But now people over 65 years of age, over 80 percent, have now been vaccinated and 66 percent fully vaccinated. And there's virtually no difference between White, Black, Hispanic, Asian American.
And so—because what we've done, under some criticism, is we have expanded access to vaccinations to familiar places—40,000 drugstores now. Also, all of the community health centers that are available all across the Nation. Mobile units going out. And it's getting better and better and better. And so that's why we're leading the world.
When I got elected, I said, in the first 100 days, we'd get 100 million people vaccinated. I was wrong; we got 230 million vaccinated.
I think you'll see—and there's a debate, you know—and I'll end with this—there's a debate on what constitutes herd immunity. ""Is it 70 percent of the population? Is it 68 percent? Is it 81 percent?""
The point is that, by the end of the summer—right now, every single person, 16 years or older, doesn't have to wait in line—can show up and get a vaccination now. My plea to everyone: Get vaccinated now please.
Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 1:09 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to Marcia Conston, president, Tidewater Community College; Pamela Northam, wife of Gov. Ralph F.

30-Apr-21,"Remarks Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Amtrak in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Hello, everyone. Great to be back in Philly. Great to be back at to 30th Street Station.
Blake, you didn't—we didn't treat each other like family, we are family.
Please sit down, guys. Sit down.
Your dad Gregg is here too. As far as I'm concerned, the Weavers are family. And, Justin Gray, speaking of family, your father and I fought a lot of fights together, planned a lot of those fights on Amtrak coming back to Philly—I didn't come all the way to Philly. It's a wonderful tribute to the station to bear his name.
And, Bill Flynn, thank you for having me. Governor Wolf, Mayor Kenney, Congressman Evans, thank you for the passport into the city. Appreciate it. And we have another—I don't know that they're all here still, but I met a lot of really important friends that were here to—for this occasion.
I understand Senator Blumenthal is here. There you go. One of the great Senators, former attorney general—took care of my son Beau when he was attorney general. Thank you very much.
And also, Dwight Evans. Dwight is here. You can't miss Dwight. Come on, Dwight, stand up there, man. And a good friend of mine, and worked like the devil to get me elected, Brendan Boyle. Brendan. That's the Irish of it, man. And Donald Payne, New Jersey. [Laughter] I keep telling, Donald, because Delaware is so small, it is a constitutional—there was a case in the Supreme Court—Delaware, the State of, owns the Delaware River up to the high watermark in New Jersey. Just want you to know that. You got to treat us with more respect.
And Mayor Kenney, thanks for the passport. Great friend. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You're doing a heck of a job.
And a real close, close friend, who was a cochairman of my campaign, and just a great friend is—our whole time—Governor Ed Rendell. Eddie, thank you, pal. This city owes you a lot.
And Tony Coscia, Chair of the—Chairman of the Board. And one of my best friends in—in life, a guy named Bert DiClemente; we've known each other from high school. We went to rival high schools. Bert ran my operation in Delaware for years and years. The one election I got the most votes in was the last election I ran for the Senate. I was also running for Vice President at the time—because, under Delaware law, if you're not out of the Senate race in a certain time period, you've got to stay in. And so Bert ran—he was the ""Senator"" in Delaware campaigning for me. He got more votes than I got. So, Bert, thank you very much.
Also, Justin Gray, I've mentioned Justin already and his dad. And Gregg Weaver, Jr.—Gregg, you're—you are family. I mean, excuse me, Blake is family. And Mary Kate, what a lovely kid.
And Bill Flynn of Amtrak.
You know, folks. The fact is that, if I—in the past when I've ended up at the 30th Street Station—Amtrak station—it's probably because I took the late train back from Washington and I slept through the Delaware stop—literally, not figuratively. I only did it about four times. But—but I would have—I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
It's an honor to celebrate Amtrak's 50th anniversary. And I look forward to a bright future for all of American rail.
You know, back in 2016, I announced a Federal loan that allowed Amtrak to purchase the new Acela trains. That's what you see behind me. And they look great. I can hardly wait to ride.
And they made—they're made in America, and I wanted to see more of that. That's why the investments in my American Jobs Plan are guided by one principle: buy American. Buy products that were made in America. And American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products to create American jobs.
When I became Vice President, one of the Capitol Hill newspapers estimated that I had taken more than 7,000 round trips on Amtrak over my career. I think that's an exaggeration. And I'm going to rely on—there's two conductors that Mr. Weaver will remember. One of them was a guy named Angelo Negri. And Angelo—there was an article—my—I guess, my fourth or fifth year as President—Vice President, saying, ""Biden travels 1,000—1,300,000 miles on Air Force One [Two].*""
And I used to—the Secret Service didn't like it, but I used to like to take the train home. My mom was sick, and I'd come—try to come home almost every weekend as Vice President to see her. And I was getting on the train, and Angelo Negri came up and he goes, ""Joey, baby!"" And he grabbed my cheek, started to squeeze it like he always did.
And I thought that he was going to get shot. [Laughter] I'm serious. And I said: ""No, no. He's a friend."" He said, ""Joey, what's the big deal? 1,200,000—300,000 miles on Air Force Two. You know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?"" I said, ""No, Ange, I don't know."" And he gave me the calculation, and he said, ""you traveled 1,515,000 miles on Amtrak."" So the fact is, I'd probably take Ange's word before I took the word of what the article said.
But the point is: In the process, as Conductor Weaver will tell you, Amtrak became my family. I literally—literally—every single day that I was in the United States Senate, got the—either the 7:28—it became the 7:32, and—or—and got home on—if I got lucky, I got the Metro that left—the last one left at 6, or I got the 7:30 coming home.
And you get to know everybody. You get to know the folks. And I used to have a Christmas party for Amtrak employees at my home, and it got so big, we ended up having it a summer party because family and retirees kept coming back.
I want to tell you: These guys and women, they work like the devil. They really, really, really do. And Amtrak wasn't just a way of getting home. It provided me, and I'm not joking, an entire other family—a community dedicated—that were professional, and that we've shared milestones in my life. And I've been allowed to share milestones in theirs.
I've been to an awful lot of weddings and christenings and, unfortunately, some burials as well. We're family. You know, I remember one night, my daughter was only 6 years old, and it was my birthday. And we were voting, and I went to Bob Dole, and I said, ""Bob, when's the next vote going to take place?"" He said, ""Joe, what—why?"" I said, ""Well, my daughter is really upset I'm not going to be able to be home for the birthday cake she made for me.""
He said, ""What do you need?"" I said, ""I need just time to catch the 5 o'clock Metro, and I can get the 6:28 coming back,"" because on the platform, you can just—in Delaware, you walk from one side to the other. I got off the train. My wife Jill was standing there, and my daughter had the cake, candle lit. I blew them out. Gave me a kiss. Walked across and got on the southbound.
So, it has been part of my life. I've been riding an Amtrak for almost as long as there's been an Amtrak. And I've come to see that Amtrak doesn't just carry us from one place to another; it opens up enormous possibilities. And especially now, it makes it possible to build an economy of the future and one that we need.
Last week, I announced the target of cutting greenhouse gases and gas emissions in half by 2030. And most of that—of those emissions in this county—in this country come from transportation. But if just 10 percent of the freight shipped in the largest trucks went by rail instead, we'd be removing 3,300,000 cars from the road. And we've been planting—it's the same as doing that are planting 260 million trees in America.
And, as I've said from the beginning, when I think about fighting climate change, I think about jobs. And rail—and, hopefully, the expansion of rail—provides good union jobs, good-paying jobs. It also connects people to jobs and economic opportunities that can be reached from wherever you live.
Let's put this in perspective: For years, I fought efforts to cut funding for Amtrak because cutting funding for Amtrak would be a disaster for our environment and our economy. Amtrak carries four times as many riders between Washington and New York City as every single airline does within 50 miles of the shore, from Florida all the way up the coast.
Imagine what we'd have to do—a single day without the Northeast Corridor, for example—with Amtrak and the Northeast Corridor—would cost the economy $100 million. If you shut down all passenger service on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, the projects that compensate for the loss—you'd have to add seven new lanes of highway on I-95. And consider that cost: average of $30 million for a linear mile on I-95.
This is a bargain of bargains of bargains. It's economical, and it's, environmentally, a lifesaver. That's why, in my Rescue Plan—American Rescue Plan—we've worked hard to keep Amtrak running. At the height of the pandemic, because we weren't traveling, Amtrak furloughed 1 million—1,200 employees. And we were able to provide emergency relief to keep rail service running. And we've now brought back 1,200 union workers who had been furloughed. And by the way, you get a union wage, not 15 bucks an hour, a prevailing wage.
But we have to do more than just build back; we have to build back better. And today, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to position Amtrak and rail and intercity rail as well, in general, to play a central role in our transformation in transportation and economic future, to make investments that can help America get back on track, no pun intended.
Before the pandemic hit, Amtrak's ridership and revenues were on the upswing. The Northeast Corridor has been making money for a long while now, but last year, the whole of Amtrak system was projected to break even for the first time in history. But then, we had the pandemic.
But there's still a huge backlog of deferred maintenance, a huge need to modernize our trains, our stations, our bridges, our tunnels. But we're talking about critical jobs like the Hudson River Tunnel, the Baltimore Potomac Tunnel, the Susquehanna River Bridge. In my American Jobs Plan, I proposed spending $10 billion a year on passenger rail and freight rail. Of this, two-thirds would support existing Amtrak routes, including the Northeast Corridor, but nationwide.
And we're talking about union jobs, as I said. And we're taking care of the riders, laying track, wiring switches, fixing bridges, tunnels, modernizing stations, and repairing and rebuilding this vital infrastructure.
This would allow for a—the potential to expand passenger rail service. Imagine a 2-hour train ride between Atlanta and Charlotte going at speeds of 220 miles an hour. And 2½-hour trip between Chicago and Detroit. Or faster and more regular trips between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, a route that I imagine could be pretty popular on Fridays.
Bill, as you've said, your vision for Amtrak calls for a new intercity rail service, up to 160 previously unserved communities being connected. Think of what it will mean for opportunity if we can connect Milwaukee to Green Bay to Madison, Scranton and Allentown to New York, Indianapolis to Louisville, and much, much more.
It's going to provide jobs. It will also accommodate jobs. And what this means is that towns and cities that have been in danger of being left out and left behind will be back in the game. It means families don't have to sacrifice the cost of living or quality, of access to opportunity that sometimes only occurs if they live in a big city.
We have a huge opportunity here to provide fast, safe, reliable, clean transportation in this country. And transit is part of the infrastructure. And like the rest of our infrastructure, we're way behind the rest of the world right now.
We need to remember: We're in competition with the rest of the world. People come here and set up businesses. People stay here, people grow because of the ability to access: access transportation, access all the infrastructure. It's what allows us to compete and—with the rest of the world to win the 21st century. We've got to move.
China already has 23,000 miles of high-speed rail—220 miles per hour—two-thirds of all the high-speed rail in the world. Two-hundred and twenty miles an hour. And the way—and they're working on transit, on trains, that can go as high as 400 miles an hour.
We're behind the curve. But, folks, as I said the other night, America is on the move again. We need to remember that we're in the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity, nothing we can't do if we do it together.
And we celebrate Amtrak's birthday. I was thinking about America—Amtrak's role, as I said, on my birthday, when they allowed me to come home and blow out that candle. There's a lot of things that Amtrak does. And you know, the fact of the matter is, if we're able to—which is now beyond the ability to pay for it—but if we're able to straighten out three curves from Washington to New York, you could make it from Washington to New York in an hour and 32 minutes—an hour and 32 minutes.
Folks, there's so much we can do. And it has such an incredibly positive impact on the environment, incredibly positive impact on work—present—on opportunities. And again, all the things we have to do to put Amtrak in place and be one of the great, great contributors to our country is, we have to invest.
And so, you know, if you think about it. When we were—when I was Vice President with Barack, he allowed me to put together a budget for Amtrak. And it had money for high-speed rail at 200 miles an hour from—excuse me, from Charlotte—one—another line going from—in Florida down to Tampa. Another line—if we had moved, Gov, we'd have that tunnel fixed in New York now. The money was there to get it done. There's so much we can do. And it's the biggest bang for the buck we can expend.
So, on this momentous birthday of Amtrak, I want to—I want to thank you for making so many birthdays possible. I believe that the best days for Amtrak and for rail and for America are ahead. I really believe that.
And I'm just confident—I'm confident—we can get this done. And I must tell you, I'm anxious to see the new train.
Thank you all so very much. God Bless America. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 2:54 p.m. at the William H.

29-Apr-21,"Remarks in an Exchange With Reporters Prior to Departure in Marietta, Georgia","The President's Visit With Former President James E. Carter, Jr., and First Lady Rosalynn Carter 
Q. How was your visit with the Carters today, sir?
The President. It was great. It was great to see President Carter. He reminded me that I was the first person to endorse him outside of Georgia. And we sat and talked about the old days. And he introduced me to a friend of his, a reverend who he wanted me to get to know. And Rosalynn was great too. We just had a nice time. It was just—they're old friends.
Q. How is his health been?
The President. His health has gotten better. I mean, he—you know, he's really—it's amazing. He keeps bouncing back. And we talked a little bit about cancer research and a few other things. But it's just great to see him.
Alleged Directed Energy Attack at the White House Ellipse 
Q. Mr. President, what do you know about this supposed direct energy attack on the Ellipse and the person who was injured?
The President. I don't know anything about it.
Q. So you have not been briefed on it?
The President. I have not been briefed on it.
The President's Rally in Duluth, Georgia/Federal Use of Private Detention Facilities 
Q. What did you make of the protesters tonight at your rally, sir?
The President. Well, when they found out I had agreed with them, they finally stopped. Because I've been opposed to funding private prisons, and that's what they were talking about. But I think they were just very emotionally excited. That's why I stopped and let them go on a little bit, and then told them where I—[inaudible]. And when they found out—they wanted me to do it immediately, like I could sign a paper and make it happen. But I——
Q. You said you—[inaudible]—in 5 more days.
The President. Yes.
Q. That's not going to be enough, is it?
The President. No, no—[inaudible]. I was teasing about—you know, I can't get—I have to get it passed. And that's what I—but I do support eliminating funding to private prisons.
Q. Does that extend to ICE?
Senator Shelley Moore Capito/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. Can you tell us more about your conversation with Senator Capito?
The President. We had a good conversation. And I invited her to come with anyone she wants to bring with her to the White House. And they're off next week—the Senate—so I said: ""If you wanted to come next week, that's fine. But if you want to wait and have our staff talk some more."" But she seemed very positive about wanting to do something serious about it. And I'm anxious to hear what they have to say.
Q. [Inaudible]—opportunity for common ground if you want to raise taxes to pay for this and they say, ""That's a nonstarter""?
The President. Well, if they say, ""We're not going to pay for it,"" then that's back to the old Republican position of, you know, cut taxes—$2 trillion, go into debt, and not pay. I mean, it's ironic how the—how this has all changed.
So I told her that we could do it in two ways. Let's decide on infrastructure—what they think is infrastructure. So if the first piece of it is they don't think broadband is infrastructure—I'm not saying she says that either.
But let's decide what is—what are they prepared to consider in terms of what constitutes infrastructure, how much of it, and then we can talk about how to pay for it if we get to the point that we actually have a real number.
But if it's like last time—and I don't—I think she's serious—but if, like last time, they come in with one-fourth or one-fifth of what I'm asking and say, ""That's a final offer,"" then there's—you know, it's a no-go for me. Then, we have to go and——
Police Reform Legislation 
Q. [Inaudible]—Senator Tim Scott to the White House to talk about police reform? Are you planning——
The President. Well, no, I'd happy to have him at the White House, but right now he has a serious negotiation going on with Senator Booker. And we should let the Senate work its will on how they're going to move that.
Q. And how much of a role would you play in that? Are you going to——
The President. No, I wouldn't play a role in that at all, other than, I've made my position clear what it is, and let them negotiate. If they—if it's a negotiation that I can support, then that's fine. If it's not, then I will be prepared to continue to—the negotiation.
Gun Control Legislation 
Q. [Inaudible]—really successful Climate Summit. Do you need to call a gun summit if you want to get something done on guns?
The President. Well, I don't think a guns summit is the way it is going to go. I think there's certain things that have already been passed in the House. It should be—they should do it. It's time for the Congress to step up.
And one of the things that I've been doing and I'm going to continue to do is make the case to the American people: This makes no sense. The idea that over 250 people were shot dead between the first time I came down and the second mass murder a week later—I mean, this is—it's absolutely—and, by the way, a significant portion of gun owners and NRA members support eliminating the assault weapons. And who the hell needs 100 rounds in a gun that can—I mean, so, the vast majority of the American people are getting fed up with it. And I think, eventually, that's going to break the back of what—the opposition.
But look, there's a lot on the plate. What I've got to figure out is what can I get done, when. It's a matter of sequencing a lot of things. There's a lot going on, and it's only been 101 days.

28-Apr-21,Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress,"The President. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good to be back. As Mitch and Chuck will understand, it's good to be almost home, down the hall. [Laughter] Anyway, thank you all.
Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President—no President has ever said those words from this podium. No President has ever said those words, and it's about time.
First Lady—I'm her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different, a reminder of the extraordinary times we're in.
Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this Chamber to speak to Congress, to the Nation, and to the world; to declare war, to celebrate peace; to announce new plans and possibilities. Tonight I come to talk about crisis and opportunity, about rebuilding the Nation, revitalizing our democracy, and winning the future for America.
I stand here tonight, 1 day shy of the hundredth day of my administration, hundred days since I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a Nation—we all did—that was in crisis: the worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.
Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the Nation: America is on the move again, turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength. We all know life can knock us down. But, in America, we never, ever, ever stay down. Americans always get up. Today, that's what we're doing: America is rising anew, choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, and light over darkness.
After 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff, in my view. We're working again, dreaming again, discovering again, and leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world that there's no quit in America—none.
One hundred days ago, America's house was on fire. And we had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi; Majority Leader Schumer; and the overwhelming support of the American people—Democrats, Independents, and Republicans—we did act. Together we passed the American Rescue Plan, one of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We're already seeing the results. [Applause] We're already seeing the results.
After I promised we'd get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into people's arms in 100 days, we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days. Thanks to all the help of all of you, we're marshaling—with your help, everyone's help—we're marshaling every Federal resource. We've gotten vaccines to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached. We're setting up community vaccination sites, developing mobile units to get to hard-to-reach communities.
Today, 90 percent of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16—everyone—is now eligible to get vaccinated right now, right away. Go get vaccinated, America. Go and get the vaccination. They're available. You're eligible now.
When I was sworn in on January 20, less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. One hundred days later, 70 percent of seniors in America over 65 are protected—fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80 percent since January—down 80 percent—because of all of you. And more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shot.
At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked the nurse—I said, ""What's it like?"" She looked at me, and she said, ""It's like every shot is giving a dose of hope""—was her phrase. ""A dose of hope.""
A dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune disease—wrote to me, said she's worried—that she was worrying about bringing the virus home. She said she then got vaccinated at a large site, in her car. She said she sat in her car, when she got vaccinated and just cried, cried out of joy and cried out of relief.
Parents seeing the smiles on their kids' faces, for those who are able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated. Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a window to say goodbye. It means everything. Those things mean everything.
You know, there's still—you all know it; you know it better than any group of Americans—there's still more work to do to beat this virus. We can't let our guard down.
But tonight I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past hundred days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievements—logistical achievements—this country has ever seen.
What else have we done in those first hundred days?
We kept our commitment—Democrats and Republicans—of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households. We've already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It's making the difference. You all know it when you go home. For many people, it's making all the difference in the world.
The single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said she couldn't work, but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment. A grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor, something she said she put off for months because she didn't have the money.
One of the defining images, at least from my perspective, in this crisis has been cars lined up, cars lined up for miles. And not people who just barely ever start those cars, nice cars lined up for miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk. I don't know about you, but I didn't ever think I'd see that in America. And all of this is through no fault of their own. No fault of their own, these people are in this position.
That's why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already. We're also providing rental assistance—you all know this, but the American people, I want to make sure they understand—keeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job.
During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established the special signup period to do that—800,000 in that period. We're making one of the largest one-time ever investments—ever—in improving health care for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we're on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year.
And, in the process, while this was all going on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 new jobs in 100 days, more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record. The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades.
America is moving—moving forward—but we can't stop now. We're in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century. We're at a great inflection point in history. We have to do more than just build back better—I mean, ""build back."" We have to build back better. We have to compete more strenuously than we have.
Throughout our history, if you think about it, public investment in infrastructure has literally transformed America: our attitudes, as well as our opportunities. The transcontinental railroad, the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of America. Universal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon—now we're on Mars—discovering vaccines, gave us the internet, and so much more.
These are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the Government was in a position to make. Time and again, they propel us into the future. That's why I proposed the American Jobs Plan, a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. This is the largest jobs plan since World War II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors, transit lines.
It's clean water. And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water, a clear and present danger to our children's health.
The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the Nation's lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water. And, in the process, it will create thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn't have it. This is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st-century economy.
And I'm asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would——
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Of course.
The President. ——because I know it will get done.
It creates jobs, building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, catastrophic failures, with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. We can do that.
Look, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers. Two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic—2 million, and too often because they couldn't get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs help.
Eight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. If you think it's not important, check out in your own district, Democrat or Republican. Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern—almost as much as their children—is taking care of an elderly loved one who can't be left alone. Medicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth.
For too long, we've failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis: ""jobs."" Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think ""climate change,"" I think ""jobs.""
The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy-efficient buildings and homes; electrical workers—IBEW members—installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways so we can own the electric car market. Farmers—farmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.
Look, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can't be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason. None. No reason. So, folks, there's no reason why American workers can't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. I mean, there is no reason. We have this capacity. We have the brightest, best trained people in the world.
The American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of good-paying jobs—jobs Americans can raise a family on—as my dad would then say, ""with a little breathing room."" And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: buy American. Buy American. And I might note, parenthetically, that does not violate any trade agreement. It's been the law since the thirties: buy American.
American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs. That's the way it's supposed to be and it will be in this administration. And I made it clear to all my Cabinet people. Their ability to give exemptions has been strenuously limited. It will be American products.
Now I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. So many of you—so many of the folks I grew up with—feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that's so rapidly changing it's frightening. I want to speak directly to you. Because if you think about it, that's what people are most worried about: ""Can I fit in?""
Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come. It is an 8-year program. These are good-paying jobs that can't be outsourced.
Nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree; 75 percent don't require an associate's degree. The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. That's what it is.
And it recognizes something I've always said in this Chamber and the other. Good guys and women on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn't build this country. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class. So that's why I'm calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Act—the PRO Act—and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize.
And by the way, while you're thinking about sending things to my desk—[laughter]—let's raise the minimum wage to $15. No one—no one working 40 hours a week—no one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line.
We need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. And while we're doing this, let's get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as well—equal pay. It's been much too long. And if you're wondering whether it's too long, look behind me.
And finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record. We will see more technological change—and some of you know more about this than I do—we'll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50. That's how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.
And we're falling behind the competition with the rest of the world. Decades ago, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America—2 percent of our gross domestic product—in research and development.
Today, Mr. Secretary, that's less than 1 percent. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.
The Secretary of Defense can tell you—and those of you on—who work on national security issues know—the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA—the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here—and that's been a long time ago—to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security—that's their only job. And it's a semiseparate agency; it's under the Defense Department. It's led to everything from the discovery of the internet to GPS and so much more that's enhanced our security.
The National Institute of Health—the NIH—I believe, should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. And that would—here's what it would do. It would have a singular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer.
I'll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President—almost $9 million going to NIH. And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I'll never forget you standing, Mitch, and saying you'd name it after my deceased son. It meant a lot.
But so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who died of cancer. I can think of no more worthy investment. I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. So let's end cancer as we know it. It's within our power. It's within our power to do it.
Investments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we're talking about, have often had bipartisan support in the past. Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their own proposal.
So let's get to work. I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the deep discussions. I'd like to meet with those who have ideas that are different—they think are better. I welcome those ideas.
But the rest of the world is not waiting for us. I just want to be clear: From my perspective, doing nothing is not an option. Look, we can't be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.
Secretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi: traveled over 17,000 miles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him. When he called to congratulate me, we had a 2-hour discussion. He's deadly earnest about becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world. He and others—autocrats—think that democracy can't compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus.
To win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children. That's why I've introduced the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.
First is access to a good education. When this Nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best educated, best prepared Nation in the world. It's, I believe, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st—in the 20th century.
But the world has caught up, or catching up. They are not waiting. I would say, parenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, ""Okay, we're going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education,"" I wonder whether we'd think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century. I doubt it. Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st century. That's why my American Families Plan guarantees 4 additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.
The great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years. It shows that adding 2 years of universal high-quality preschool for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old, no matter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years. It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduation. The research shows when a young child goes to school—not daycare—they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.
When you add 2 years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the dynamic. We can do that.
And we'll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions. The reason is: They don't have the endowments, but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy—all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.
Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She's long said—if I've heard it once, I've heard it a thousand times: ""Joe, any country that outeducates us is going to outcompete us."" She'll be deeply involved in leading this effort. Thank you, Jill.
Second thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare. We guarantee—and I'm proposing a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime.
Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and medical leave—family and medical leave. We're one of the few industrial countries in the world. No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones—a parent, a spouse, or child.
And fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans. In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to $3,000 per child, if they're under 6 years of age—I mean, excuse me—under—over [under]* 6 years of age, and $3,600 for children over 6 years of age.
With two parents, two kids, that's $7,200 in the pockets that's going to help to take care of your family. And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child]* poverty in half. And we can afford it. So we did that in the last piece of legislation we passed. But let's extend that childcare tax credit at least through the end of 2025.
The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I know that's really popular on this side of the aisle. [Laughter] But let's make that provision permanent so their premiums don't go back up.
In addition to my Families Plan, I'm going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women's health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly—how badly—it's needed. Let's lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care—in the Affordable Care Act. And let's lower prescription drug costs.
We know how to do this. The last President had that as an objective. We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America. In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in America—nearly three times—for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay. We have to change that, and we can.
Let's do what we've always talked about for all the years I was down here in this body—in Congress. Let's give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices. And by the way, it won't just help people on Medicare, it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone.
And the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny. It's within our power to do it; let's do it now. We've talked about it long enough. Democrats and Republicans, let's get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right and not a privilege in America.
So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan? I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits. Let's start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000. It's—but it's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share. Just their fair share.
Sometimes, I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party. I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.
A recent study shows that 55 of the nation's biggest corporations paid zero Federal tax last year. Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit. A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. It's not right.
We're going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well. And we're going to reward work, not just wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans—those making over $400,000 or more—back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he started: 39.6 percent. That's where it was when George W. was President.
We're going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck. We're only going to affect three-tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that action—three-tenths of 1 percent. And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. It's estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that are left, right, and center.
I'm not looking to punish anybody. But I will not add a tax burden—additional tax burden to the middle class in this country. They're already paying enough. I believe what I propose is fair, fiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.
When you hear someone say that they don't want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or corporate America, ask them: ""Whose taxes you want to raise instead? Whose are you going to cut?""
Look, the big tax cut of 2017, remember, it was supposed to pay for itself—that was how it was sold—and generate vast economic growth. Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.
Instead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development, it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes. It used to be in the—below a hundred.
The pandemic has only made things worse. Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemic: working and middle class Americans. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion, in the same exact period. Let me say it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic. And they're now worth more than $4 trillion.
My fellow Americans, trickle-down—trickle-down—economics has never worked, and it's time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. You know, there's a broad consensus of economists—left, right, center—and they agree what I'm proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest value investments we can make as a Nation.
I've often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our power. In my conversations with world leaders—and I've spoken to over 38, 40 of them now—I've made it known—I've made it known—that America is back. And you know what they say? The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say: ""We see America is back, but for how long? But for how long?""
My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we're back, but that we're back to stay and that we aren't going to go it alone. We're going to do it by leading with our allies. No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time—from terrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well as experiencing—what we're experiencing now with pandemics.
There's no wall high enough to keep any virus out. And our own vaccine supply, as it grows to meet our needs—and we're meeting them—will become an arsenal for vaccines for other countries, just as America was the arsenal of democracy for the world and, in consequence, influenced the world.
But every American will have access before that occurs—every American will have access to be fully covered by COVID-19 from the vaccines we have.
Look, the climate crisis is not our fight alone, it's a global fight. The United States accounts, as all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent. That's why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris accord—because if we do everything perfectly, it's not going to ultimately matter.
I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the major economies of the world—China, Russia, India, the European Union—and I said I'd do it in my first hundred days.
I want to be very blunt about it: I had—my attempt was to make sure that the world could see there was a consensus, that we are at an inflection point in history. And consensus—the consensus is: If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world. If you've watched any of it—and you were all busy; I'm sure you didn't have much time—that's what virtually every nation said, even the ones that aren't doing their fair share.
The investments I've proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China.
My discussions—in my discussions with President Xi, I told him, ""We welcome the competition. We're not looking for conflict."" But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America's interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state—to state-owned operations and enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.
I also told President Xi that we'll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific, just as we do with NATO in Europe, not to start a conflict, but to prevent one. I told him what I've said to many world leaders: that America will not back away from our commitments—our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms and to our alliances.
And I pointed out to him: No responsible American President could remain silent when basic human rights are being so blatantly violated. An American President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for. America is an idea, the most unique idea in history: We are created, all of us, equal. It's who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle and, in fact, say we're dealing with the American idea.
With regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I made very clear to Putin that we're not going to seek—excuse me—escalation, but their actions will have consequence if they turn out to be true. And they turned out to be true, so I responded directly and proportionally to Russia's interference in our elections and the cyber attacks on our Government and our business. They did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have.
But we can also cooperate when it's in our mutual interest. We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we're working to do it on climate change. But he understands we will respond.
On Iran and North Korea—nuclear programs that present serious threats to American security and the security of the world—we're going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy, as well as stern deterrence.
And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. We have, without hyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. I'm the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a war zone. Today, we have servicemembers serving in the same war zone as their parents did. We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11.
The war in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be multigenerational undertakings of nation-building. We went to Afghanistan to get terrorists—the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11—and we said we would follow Usama bin Laden to the gates",,,,,,,,,,,,,
of hell to do it. If you've been to the upper Kunar Valley, you've kind of seen the gates of hell. And we delivered justice to bin Laden. We degraded the terrorist threat of Al Qaida in Afghanistan. And after 20 years of value—valor and sacrifice, it's time to bring those troops home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look, even as we do, we will maintain an over-the-horizon capacity to suppress future threats to the homeland. And make no mistake: In 20 years, terrorists has—terrorism has metastasized. The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan. And those of you in the intelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, the defense committees, you know well: We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from. Al Qaida and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, the Middle East, and beyond.,,,,
And we won't ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism. We're not going to ignore that either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this Nation. It was nearly a year ago, before her father's funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd's young daughter. She's a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye. And she looked at me and she said," """"My daddy changed the world."""" Well", after the conviction of George Floyd's murderer, we can see how right she was if we have the courage to act as a Congress.,,,,,,
We've all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans. Now is our opportunity to make some real progress. The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our communities, and they serve them honorably. I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact police reform in George Floyd's name that passed the House already. I know Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate. We need to work together to find a consensus. But let's get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd's death.,,,,,,,,,,,
The country supports this reform, and Congress should act—should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justice—real justice. And with the plans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America and American lives in other ways; a chance to deliver real equity—good jobs, good schools, affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down two generations because you have an access to purchase a house. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans: Black, White, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans.,,,,
Look, I also want to thank the United States Senate for voting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. You acted decisively. And you can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we've seen over the past year—this past year and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, which I will gladly, anxiously sign.,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans. To all transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want you to know your President has your back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another thing: Let's authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law for 27 years. Twenty-seven years ago," I wrote it. It will close the—the act that has to be authorized now will close the """"boyfriend"""" loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. The court order said: """"This is an abuser. You can't own a gun."""" It's to close that loophole that existed. You know", it's estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America—50 a month. Let's pass it and save some lives.,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America. The flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. And, in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America—250 shot dead.,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the nineties, we passed universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. Check out the report over 10 years. But in the early twenty—2000s, the law expired, and we've seen daily bloodshed since. I'm not saying if the law continued, we wouldn't see bloodshed.,,,,,,,,,,
More than 2 weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know—the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence—I laid out several of the Department of Justice actions that are being taken to impact on this epidemic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One of them is banning so-called """"ghost guns."""" These are homemade guns built from a kit that includes directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers", so they show up at crime scenes, and they can't be traced. The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren't required to pass any background check. Anyone, from a criminal or terrorist, could buy this kit and, within 30 minutes, have a weapon that's lethal. But no more.,,,,,,,,,
And I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it's time for Congress to act as well. Look, I don't want to become confrontational, but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democratic colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don't tell me it can't be done. We did it before, and it worked.,,,,,,,,,,,
Talk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They'll tell you there's no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a weapon. What do you think: deer are wearing Kevlar vests? [Laughter] No, what's—they'll tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but shouldn't be able to buy a gun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, including many gun owners. The country supports reform and is—and Congress should act.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This shouldn't be a red or blue issue. And no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You can't yell """"Fire!"""" in a crowded theater. From the very beginning", there were certain guns, weapons, that could not be owned by Americans. Certain people could not own those weapons ever. We're not changing the Constitution; we're being reasonable. I think this is not a Democrat or Republican issue, I think it's an American issue.,,,,,,,,,,,
And here's what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America. Let's end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we've done nothing about it. It's time to fix it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks—the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We can actually—if you actually want to solve a problem, I've sent a bill to—so take a close look at it.,,,,,,,,,,
We have to—also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly to—to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador: the violence, the corruption, the gangs, and the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters.,,,,,
When I was President, my President—when I was Vice President, the President asked me to focus on providing the help needed to address the root causes of migration. And it helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. The plan was working, but the last administration decided it was not worth it. I'm restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this. I have absolute confidence she'll get the job done.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now, look, if you don't like my plan," let's at least pass what we all agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for """"dreamers", the young people who have only known America as their home. And permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and natural-made—violence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables.,,,,,,,,,,,
Look, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let's argue over it, let's debate it, but let's act.,,,,,,,,,,,,
And if we truly want to restore the soul of America, we need to protect the sacred right to vote. Most people—more people voted in the last Presidential election than any time in American history, in the middle of the worst pandemic ever. It should be celebrated. Instead, it's being attacked. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my desk right away. The country supports it. The Congress should act now.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look, in closing, as we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol, desecrating our democracy, remain vivid in all our minds. Lives were put at risk—many of your lives. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis, a test of whether our democracy could survive. And it did.,,,,,,,,,
But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent, as old as our Republic, still vital today. Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility? Can our democracy deliver the most—to the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate, and fears that have pulled us apart?,,,,,,
America's adversaries—the autocrats of the world—are betting we can't. And I promise you, they're betting we can't. They believe we're too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. But they are wrong. You know it; I know it. But we have to prove them wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have to prove democracy still works, that our Government still works and we can deliver for our people. In our first hundred days together, we've acted to restore the people's faith in democracy to deliver. We're vaccinating the Nation. We're creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. We're delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Opening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice," that's the essence of America. That's democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the words—as trite as it sounds—""""We the People"""". Well"," it's time to remember that """"We the People"""" are the Government—you and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force that we have no control over. It's us. It's """"We the People.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,
In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us," """"In America"," we do our part."""" We all do our part. That's all I'm asking: that we do our part", all of us. If we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. Autocrats will not win the future. We will. America will. And the future belongs to America.,,,,,,,,,,
As I stand here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our Nation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic about America, not because I'm President, because what's happening with the American people.,,,,,,,,,,,
We have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain," and """"We the People"""" did not flinch. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail", we came together. We united. With light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new resolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more perfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one Nation, and one America.,,,,
Folks, as I told every world leader I've ever met with over the years, it's never ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn't.,,,,,,,,,,,
We are the United States of America. There is not a single thing—nothing—nothing beyond our capacity. We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together. So let's begin to get together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
God bless you all," and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience.""","NOTE: The President spoke at 9:06 p.m. in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol.

27-Apr-21,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon—this beautiful afternoon.
Next week, I'll be laying out the path ahead to continue our fight against COVID-19 to get us to July 4. This is our target date to get life in America closer to normal and to begin to celebrate our independence from the virus together with our friends and loved ones as we—to celebrate Independence Day.
But before that, I wanted to speak briefly to all of you today about the recent change announced by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC.
Let me say first: While we still have a long way to go in this fight and a lot of work to do in May and June to get us to July 4, we've made stunning progress because of all of you, the American people. Cases and deaths are down, down dramatically from where they were when I took office on January 20, and continuing to fall.
That is particularly true for a group of Americans that we were most worried about when it came to this virus: senior citizens. When I took office in January, we were losing literally tens of thousands of our seniors each week: grandparents who were loved so dearly, moms and dads, pillars of every community, gone by the thousands every day. At that time, less than 1 percent of seniors were fully vaccinated when I took office.
Today, in less than 100 days, more than 67 percent—two-thirds of our seniors—are now fully vaccinated, and more than 80 percent of seniors have had at least one shot. That effort has resulted in a drop of 80 percent in deaths among American seniors, a 70-percent drop in hospitalizations. So instead of losing thousands of seniors each day, we're saving thousands of lives, and more and more as each day goes by.
And by the way, based on reported data, the proportion—the proportion of seniors—who have been vaccinated is essentially equal between White and seniors of color. I said from the beginning that we were—we're going to fight this virus with equity, equity for all. As a matter of a fact, if I'm not mistaken, there are more Latinos and African American seniors that have been vaccinated, as a percentage, than White seniors. These numbers are a sign of progress on that front as well.
Now, last week, I announced that we had crossed the threshold of 200 million shots. We've now—since Inauguration Day, we have given 215 million shots. And that—anyone 16 years of age or older is now eligible to get the vaccine: now, today, immediately.
And because of the extraordinary progress we've made in fighting this virus and the progress our scientists have made in learning about how it gets transmitted, earlier today the CDC made an important announcement: Starting today, if you're fully vaccinated and you're outdoors, you need—and not in a big crowd—you no longer need to wear a mask.
I want to be absolutely clear: If you're in a crowd, like a stadium or at a conference or a concert, you still need to wear a mask even if you're outside. But beginning today, gathering with a group of friends in a park, going for a picnic—as long as you are vaccinated and outdoors—you can do it without a mask. The CDC is able to make this announcement because our scientists are convinced by the data that the odds of getting or giving the virus to others is very, very low if you're—both been fully vaccinated and out the open air.
The CDC also have clarified which outdoor activities are safer or less safe, depending on whether you've been vaccinated. The bottom line is clear: If you're vaccinated, you can do more things, more safely, both outdoors as well as indoors. For—so for those who haven't gotten their vaccination yet, especially if you're younger or thinking you don't need it, this is another great reason to go get vaccinated now—now.
Yes, the vaccines are about saving your life, but also the lives of the people around you. But they're also about helping you—us get back to closer to normal in our living—more normal living: getting together with friends, going to the park for a picnic without needing to mask up. We're back to that place now as long as you get vaccinated.
So go get this shot. It's never been easier. And once you're fully vaccinated, you can go without a mask when you're outside and away from big crowds.
I want to thank the team at the CDC for everything they're doing to help us lead with science and bring our communities out of this crisis safely and responsibly. And I also want to thank everyone who has gotten the vaccine for doing your patriotic duty and helping us get to—on the path to Independence Day, which I'll be discussing more in detail next week.
In the meantime, I urge all Americans: Don't let up now. Keep following the guidance. Go get your vaccination now. It's free, and it's convenient. Ninety percent of the American people live within 5 miles of a site where you can get a vaccination. You can do this, and we will do this.
Thank you all. And God bless you. And as much as the temptation is to stay outdoors on this beautiful day, I've got more work to do.
Thank you all very, very much. Bye-bye.
Q. Mr. President, if the risk is so low outdoors, why doesn't it apply to everybody?
Q. Mr. President, would you have any preconditions for a meeting with Vladimir Putin—wait, would you have any preconditions before meeting with Vladimir Putin?
The President. I—one at a time.
Coronavirus Prevention Efforts 
Q. If the risk is so low outdoors, why doesn't this new guidance apply to everybody?
The President. Because the science indicates that this is the most certain way to make sure it doesn't spread: if both people have been vaccinated—the people you're with—and you're outside.
Q. And you chose to wear a mask. Sir, you chose to wear a mask.
Q. Do you have any preconditions before meeting with Vladimir——
Q. You chose to wear a mask as you walked out here. What message were you sending by wearing a mask outside alone?
The President. By watching me take it off and not put it back on until I get inside.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. Do you have any preconditions before meeting with Vladimir Putin?
The President. I'll discuss that all another day. Thank you.
Q. What have you asked Vice President Harris to do?
U.S. Vaccine and Component Material Support for India/Coronavirus Treatment Assistance 
Q. Sir, India—India needs medicine. India needs AstraZeneca. Sir, will you make it faster to get—for them to get the vaccine—the vaccines we will get soon?
The President. You said India?
Q. India. They're suffering at this moment.
Q. What do you say to the folks in India?
Q. Will you make it——
The President. Look, I'm sorry. I'm going to—this is the last question I'll take, and I've had—I'm really going to be in trouble.
With regard to India, I spoke at length with Modi, the Prime Minister. We are sending immediately a whole series of help that he needs, including providing for those—remdesivir and other drugs that are able to deal with this and prevent, in some cases, but recover—help recovery.
Secondly, we are sending the actual mechanical parts that are needed for the machinery they have to build a vaccine. And that's being done as well.
We're also discussing—I've discussed with him when we'll be able to send actual vaccines to India, which would be my intention to do. The problem is, right now, we have to make sure we have other vaccines, like Novavax and others, coming on, probably. And I think we'll be in a position to be able to share—to share—vaccines, as well as know-how, with other countries who are in real need.
That's the hope and expectation.
And I might add, when we were in a bind at the very beginning, India helped us.
Thank you.
Q. Sir, what have you asked the Vice President to do to help with vaccine skepticism?
Q. How will you decide which countries?
Q. How do you convince those still——",NOTE: The President spoke at 1:55 p.m. on the North Lawn at the White House.,"Joseph R.

23-Apr-21,Remarks at the Virtual Leaders Summit on Climate Session on the Economic Opportunities of Climate Action,"Well, welcome back. And thank you all again—all the world leaders who have joined us—thank you for joining. And, John, thank you for putting this together.
We've made great progress, in my view, so far. And I'm grateful to all the leaders who have announced new commitments to help us meet the existential threat of climate change. This summit is a start, a start of a road that will take us to Glasgow for the U.N. Climate Change Conference in November where we're going to make these commitments real, putting all of our nations on a path to a secure, prosperous, and sustainable future.
Today's final session is not about the threat of climate change poses; it's about the opportunity that addressing climate change provides. It's an opportunity to create millions of good-paying jobs around the world and innovate—in innovative sectors—you know, jobs that bring greater quality of life, greater dignity to the people performing those jobs in every nation.
For a line worker, electricians, utility workers: laying transmission lines, connecting battery storage, and making our electric grid more modern. For automotive workers: building electric cars, trucks, and buses. Skilled workers installing and charge—charging stations to accommodate them throughout our countries.
Construction workers, engineers, insulators: upgrading our schools and commercial buildings and constructing new energy-efficient homes. Manufacturing: manufacturing workers building nuclear and carbon capture technologies, solar panels, and wind turbines. And people working in the fields that we haven't even conceived of yet—on farms and on factories and in laboratories and universities with things we haven't even thought of so far.
This is—this challenge and these opportunities are going to be met by working people in every nation. And as we transition to a clean energy future, we must ensure that workers who have thrived in yesterday's and today's industries have as bright a tomorrow in the new industries as well as in the places where they live, in the communities they have built.
When we invest in climate resilience and infrastructure, we create opportunities for everyone. That's at the heart of my Jobs Plan that I proposed here in United States. It's how our Nation intends to build an economy that gives everybody a fair shot.
As you heard in the last session, it requires investing in innovation. That's why I've asked the Secretary of Energy—my Energy Secretary, Jennifer Granholm, who you saw earlier—to speed the development of critical technologies to tackle the climate crisis.
No single technology is the answer on its own, because every sector requires innovation to meet this moment. You know, this critical effort is going to propel the most impactful breakthroughs at home and around the world and lower the cost of—we're paying now for polluting the air so badly. We're going to move to net zero in a transition in all countries.
Now, look, every country will need to invest in new clean-energy technologies as we work forward and—to deal with net-zero emissions.
I am also very proud to announce the United States is again becoming a key leader in Mission Innovation—we helped launch the program during the Obama-Biden administration—a pact between the world's largest economies to ramp up investments in clean-energy research and development.
And today, America is once again stepping into the leadership role. We will be joining and a partner—for the nations and efforts to decarbonize critical sectors across the board, including industrial sector, where we'll join with Sweden and India, and leadership—in the Leadership Group for Industry Transition; the power sector, where we'll work alongside of the United Kingdom to spread progress and speed it up toward a carbon-free power system both here and around the world; and in agriculture—the agricultural sector, where we'll launch the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate with the United Arab Emirates and other partners.
We also—I'm very heartened by President Putin's call yesterday for the world to collaborate and advance carbon dioxide removal. And the United States looks forward to working with Russia and other countries in that endeavor. It has a great promise.
This is a moment for all of us to build better economies for our children, our grandchildren, and all of us to thrive in—and not just now, but beyond for the next generations.
Nations that work together to invest in a cleaner economy will reap rewards for their citizens. The United States is committed—we are committed—to making those investments to grow our economy here at home while connecting with markets around the world.
For example, we're launching a new Global Partnership for Climate-Smart Infrastructure. This will create good-paying jobs here in America by supporting development of new clean infrastructure in our partner countries.
These are the sort of partnerships that are going to be good for all of us. And I think they'll have additional benefits just with us working together.
And today I'm excited to welcome my counterparts in Spain, Nigeria, Vietnam, and Poland to share their thinking on how to realize the economies—the economic opportunities of the climate response.
And we're going to be joined by labor, and business, community leaders from around the world to talk about what's happening in their communities around climate-related jobs.
And I'm pleased to be joined by Secretary Buttigieg, Ambassador Tai, and National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy, the Chair of my National Climate Task Force.
I look forward to our conversation and making more progress throughout today. Thank you.
[At this point, the President participated in a virtual roundtable discussion, and no transcript was provided. He then made closing remarks as follows.]
Well, John, thank you. As we close this historic summit, I want to take a moment to thank the world leaders and all the participants from around the globe who have joined together to confront the existential threat of climate change. There's no threat like it.
Over the last 2 days, I think we made some important progress. In the spirit of increasing efforts to address climate change globally, we're launching an initiative to help developing countries strengthen their climate efforts while achieving their development goals. And that's going to mean money.
Yesterday I announced the United States made a new commitment, under the Paris Agreement, to cut our emissions by 50 to 52 percent by the end of this decade. And we'll get there by investing in American workers, American jobs, American infrastructure, and building a stronger and more resilient economy.
We also welcome ambitious targets announced this week by two great partners. My good friend, the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Suga, announced that Japan will cut emissions by up to 60—excuse me—50 percent below the 2013 levels, almost doubling their current target. Prime Minister Trudeau, another good friend, from Canada, will reduce emissions by as much as 45 percent below the 2005 levels.
These announcements came on top of a demonstrated leadership and strong existing targets set by the European Union and the United Kingdom. And together, these commitments mean that half of the world's economy is now committed to pace the action that we need to—at a pace we need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, an amount beyond which scientists tell us—we have said a thousand times—all of us could be at a point of no return.
We also heard encouraging news—announcements from Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, and South Korea. And I'm looking forward to working with India's Prime Minister Modi in a new partnership to achieve our climate and energy goals, making this a core pillar of our bilateral cooperation.
And the commitments we've made must become real. Commitment without us doing it, it's just a lot of hot air. No pun intended. You know, we must implement these commitments, accelerate them, and innovate and invest in order to reach them. And we need to work together, once again, to build a clean energy future that delivers good jobs and overcomes the threat of climate change, investing in innovation and in our people, raising our ambitions, ensuring every nation does its part.
And we'll meet again in Glasgow in November for the U.N. Climate Conference. I believe we're going to meet those moments. I think we're going to meet the moment that we've all been talking about to make this commitment and to keep the commitment. It's an economic imperative. I think it's a moral imperative to future generations.
Here in America, there's never been a challenge we couldn't meet if we put our minds to it and did it together. I hope your countries feel the same way. I know we can do this. I know we can do this.
Thank you for your commitment, thank you for joining the summit, and thank you for stepping up to confront this crisis before it's too late. I know we can seize the opportunities of a cleaner, stronger, and more resilient economy and deliver the benefits to people in each of our nations.
So I look forward to working alongside you to confront the climate crisis, to build a better world for all of our children and grandchildren. We're going to do this together.
Thank you all. And may God bless you. And let's get to work. Thanks again.","NOTE: The President spoke at 9:43 a.m. from the East Room at the White House.

22-Apr-21,Remarks at the Virtual Leaders Summit on Climate Session on Investing in Climate Solutions,"Well, hello again, everyone. Welcome back. As I mentioned this morning, meeting the moment on climate change must begin with a recognition that every nation has a responsibility and every nation is at risk. Hurricanes and wildfires don't confine themselves to national borders. Instability and displacement in one country has ripple effects that are felt throughout the regions and across the world.
Taking on climate change together is more than just the right thing to do; it's also in everyone's best interests to do it. Meeting this challenge is going to require mobilizing financing at an unprecedented scale.
The private sector is already recognizing this. They know that climate change is more than a threat. It also presents the largest job creation opportunities in history. Hundreds of billions of dollars are already being invested worldwide every year, supporting projects to help build a resilient economies with net-zero emission goals.
But the private sector has more it can do and must do. Let's be clear: Even then, the private sector can't meet these challenges alone. Governments need to step up, and they need to lead. We have a role to play in making sure that material climate risks to financial systems are measured, disclosed, and mitigated. If Wall Street is pumping billions of dollars into businesses that could be turned upside down when the next storm comes—and we know there will be more storms—Wall Street needs to make clear the risk it's taking on.
Those dollars—those dollars being invested—are often the hard-earned savings of our workers: pensions. We can't take steps to protect our workers if we don't step up. We have to be able to move forward from the downside deal, then into the upside, and strengthen the resilience of our financial system. I have directed my team to develop an approach to do exactly that.
You know, and our nations must—all of our nations must stand together in shifting policies and on public investment as well, you know, to invest in breakthrough technologies; to finally end fossil fuel subsidies; to help the world's most vulnerable nations and those bearing the least responsibility for the climate crisis cope with the devastating impacts of the climate crisis; you know, to help developing economies leapfrog to a clean technologies of tomorrow; to mobilize the trillions of dollars needed to make the most of the opportunity to build a clean-energy, job-rich path to meet our goals; to make sure that our climate response is about more than just building and developing new sectors, but also about international security, regional stability, food security, and gender and racial equality as well.
You know, our shared goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year in developing countries is critical for achieving that. It's an investment that's going to pay significant dividends for all of us. And to help meet that goal, the United States will double its 2024—by 2024, our annual public climate financing development to developing countries. Compare that to what we were providing during the second half of the Obama-Biden administration.
At the same time, we intend to triple our public financing for climate application in developing countries by 2024, recognizing the dividends that pays in reducing costs of disasters and conflicts are avoided. You know, our Development Finance Corporation is committing to net-zero emissions through its investment portfolio by 2040 and to increase climate-focused investments to 33 percent of all new investments beginning in 2023, the earliest of any country.
In addition, today we are issuing America's first-ever International Climate Finance Plan. This plan represents our vision for financing the global climate response in a coordinated way. It lays out specific steps that Federal agencies of the United States will take to increase both the quality and quantity of climate financing. And it will help us spur the private sector to contribute more to climate solutions in developing nations and here at home as well.
You know, this moment demands urgency. Good ideas and good intentions aren't good enough. We need to ensure that the financing will be there, both public and private, to meet the moment on climate change and to help us seize the opportunity for good jobs, strong economies, and a more secure world.
I'm confident—I'm confident—that we are going to get this done together. And I look forward to the progress we're going to make together in today's sessions.
So let's move on.",NOTE: The President spoke at 10:50 a.m. from the East Room at the White House.,"Joseph R.

22-Apr-21,Remarks at the Virtual Leaders Summit on Climate Session on Raising Our Climate Ambition,"Thank you, Madam Vice President.
Good morning to all of our colleagues around the world, the world leaders who are taking part in this summit. I thank you. You know, your leadership on this issue is a statement to the people of your nation and to the people of every nation, especially our young people, that we're ready to meet this moment. And meeting this moment is about more than preserving our planet, it's also about providing a better future for all of us.
That's why, when people talk about climate, I think jobs. Within our climate response lies an extraordinary engine of job creation and economic opportunity ready to be fired up. That's why I've proposed a huge investment in American infrastructure and American innovation to tap the economic opportunity that climate change presents our workers and our communities, especially those too often that have—left out and left behind.
I'd like to build—I want to build a critical infrastructure to produce and deploy clean technology, both those we can harness today and those that we'll invent tomorrow. I talked to the experts, and I see the potential for a more prosperous and equitable future. The signs are unmistakable. The science is undeniable. But the cost of inaction is—keeps mounting.
The United States isn't waiting. We are resolving to take action, not only the—our Federal Government, but our cities and our States all across our country; small businesses, large businesses, large corporations; American workers in every field.
I see an opportunity to create millions of good-paying, middle class, union jobs. I see line workers laying thousands of miles of transmission lines for a clean, modern, resilient grid. I see workers capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up, and abandoned coal mines that need to be reclaimed, putting a stop to the methane leaks and protecting the health of our communities.
I see autoworkers building the next generation of electric vehicles and electricians installing nationwide for 500,000 charging stations along our highways. I see engine—the engineers and the construction workers building new carbon capture and green hydrogen plants to forge cleaner steel and cement and produce clean power. I see farmers deploying cutting-edge tools to make soil of our heartland the next frontier in carbon innovation.
By maintaining those investments and putting these people to work, the United States sets out on the road to cut greenhouse gases in half—in half—by the end of this decade. That's where we're headed as a nation, and that's what we can do if we take action to build an economy that's not only more prosperous, but healthier, fairer, and cleaner for the entire planet.
You know, these steps will set America on a path of net-zero emissions economy by no later than 2050. But the truth is, America represents less than 15 percent of the world's emissions. No nation can solve this crisis on our own, as I know you all fully understand. All of us, all of us—and particularly those of us who represent the world's largest economies—we have to step up.
You know, those that do take action and make bold investments in their people and clean energy future will win the good jobs of tomorrow and make their economies more resilient and more competitive.
So let's run that race; win more—win more sustainable future than we have now; overcome the existential crisis of our times. We know just how critically important that is, because scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade. This is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. We must try to keep the Earth's temperature and—to an increase of—to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
You know, the world beyond 1.5 degrees means more frequent and intense fires, floods, droughts, heat waves, and hurricanes tearing through communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods, increasingly dire impacts to our public health.
It's undeniable and—you know, the idea of accelerating and the reality that will come if we don't move. We can't resign ourselves to that future. We have to take action, all of us.
And this summit is our first step on the road we'll travel together—God willing, all of us—to and through Glasgow this November and the U.N. climate conference—the climate change conference, you know, to set our world on a path to a secure, prosperous, and sustainable future. The health of communities throughout the world depends on it. The well-being of our workers depends on it. The strength of our economies depends on it.
The countries that take decisive action now to create the industries of the future will be the ones that reap the economic benefits of the clean energy boom that's coming.
You know, we're here at this summit to discuss how each of us, each country, can set higher climate ambitions that will in turn create good-paying jobs, advance innovative technologies, and help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts.
We have to move. We have to move quickly to meet these challenges. The steps our countries take between now and Glasgow will set the world up for success to protect livelihoods around the world and keep global warming at a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius. We must get on the path now in order to do that.
If we do, we'll breathe easier, literally and figuratively; we'll create good jobs here at home for millions of Americans and lay a strong foundation for growth for the future. And that can be your goal as well. This is a moral imperative, an economic imperative, a moment of peril, but also a moment of extraordinary possibilities.
Time is short, but I believe we can do this. And I believe that we will do this.
Thank you for being part of the summit. Thank you and—for the communities that you—and the commitments you have made, the communities you're from. God bless you all.
And I look forward to progress that we can make together today and beyond. We really have no choice. We have to get this done.",NOTE: The President spoke at 8:07 a.m. from the East Room at the White House.,"Joseph R.

21-Apr-21,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon, everyone.
Back in December, I set a goal of administering 100 million shots—vaccine shots in my first 100 days in office. At the time, some told us that it couldn't be done, it was awfully ambitious. But we did it in 58 days because of the incredible staff I have.
And so I set a second goal to deliver 200 million shots in my first 100 days in office, a goal unmatched in the world or in prior mass vaccination efforts in American history. When tomorrow's vaccine—vaccination numbers come out, it will show that today we did it. Today we hit 200 million shots on the 92d day in office. Two hundred million shots in 100 days—in under 100 days, actually. It's an incredible achievement for the Nation, and here's the context:
You know, at the pace we were moving when I took office, it would have taken us more than 220 days—almost 7 months—7½ months—to reach 200 million shots. Instead of marking this milestone in April, we would not have seen it until early September at the earliest.
Some experts say that our—the rapid vaccination effort has already saved tens of thousands of American lives. We'll never know exactly, but we know it saved lives that would have otherwise been lost.
I'm proud of the work my administration has done to get Americans vaccinated. But more than that, I'm proud of the American people: the volunteers who showed up to staff vaccination sites in their neighborhoods, drove senior citizens to get their shots; FEMA; the military, the National Guard; State and local health departments and providers running sites safely and efficiently; retired health care workers coming back to give lifesaving shots to people in their communities.
This is an American achievement, a powerful demonstration of unity and resolve, what unity will do for us, and a reminder of what we can accomplish when we pull together as one people to a common goal.
Now that we've reached this milestone, we're entering a new phase of our vaccination effort. As of Monday, at my direction, and with the support of 50 Governors—Democrats and Republicans, alike—everyone over the age of 16 will be [is now]* eligible to get vaccinated.
The first 3 months of our vaccination program focused on targeting vaccines to specific high-risk groups. Now our objective is to reach everyone—everyone over the age of 16 in America. Wherever you live, whatever your circumstances, if you are 16 or older, you are now eligible for a free COVID vaccine shot, and we have the vaccine to deliver.
We head into this next phase—it's important for us to look at where we stand. After 3 months of targeting vaccinations largely to health care workers, frontline workers, and people with high-risk conditions; nursing homes—nursing home residents and seniors—the progress we've made has been stunning.
Let me point out a few achievements. First, as of this past Sunday, more than 50 percent of adult Americans have had at least one vaccine shot. We still have a long way to go, but that's an important marker of progress.
When it comes to our target groups, the largest groups we've focused on in these past 92 days have been seniors: Americans age 65 and older. They account for 80 percent of all the COVID deaths before we started vaccinating.
When I took office, 8 percent of the people over 65 had received their first shot. I'm pleased to announce that, by tomorrow, that total will exceed 80 percent of the people over the age of 65. Eighty percent of American seniors of all races, religions, political views will have had at least one shot.
It will be another month or so before we see the full benefits of this effort, as many seniors still need the second shot plus the 2 weeks to gain that protection after the second shot.
But already, we've seen a dramatic decline in deaths among people over the age of 65, an 80-percent reduction in deaths of people over the age of 65. Still, far too many lives lost, but also a lot of lives saved. In the weeks ahead, as more seniors reach full vaccination, that number of lives lost will continue to decrease.
You know, we've made great progress with another target group as well: educators, school staff, bus drivers, and childcare workers. Back in February, when many of our schools were fully or partially closed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued guidelines to help reopen our schools safely. Then, in March, Congress approved the American Rescue Plan to fund the safe reopening of our schools.
One thing was clear: Many educators were understandably anxious about going back to a classroom without being vaccinated, and many parents were understandably nervous about sending their kids back as well.
So, on March the 2nd, I launched a program directing all States to make educators, school staff, school bus drivers, childcare workers eligible for vaccination in every State so that schools and childcare centers could open with a peace of mind. Within a month, 80 percent had received at least one shot, and schools and childcare centers all over the country are reopening.
Now, to be clear, we still have some work to do with our target groups, but we've made remarkable progress. And, as we continue, as I said, the time is now to open up a new phase of this historic vaccination effort. To put it simply: If you've been waiting for your turn, wait no longer. Now is the time for everyone over 16 years of age to get vaccinated.
Unlike the target groups, where we've made such great progress, the broad swath of American adults still remain largely unvaccinated. In a number of States, they weren't eligible for the vaccination until this week. Too many younger Americans may still think they don't need to get vaccinated.
So let me explain two reasons why we need everyone over 16 years of age in America to get vaccinated and share what we're going to do to encourage it. The first reason, quite simply, is to keep you from getting very sick or dying. Hundreds of Americans are still dying from COVID every day. The data could not be clearer at this point:
If you are fully vaccinated, 2 weeks beyond your last shot, you are nearly 100-percent protected against death from COVID. No matter what your age, no matter what your health history, until you are fully vaccinated, you are still vulnerable. The vaccine can save your life.
The second reason to get vaccinated is to protect your community, your family, your friends, and your neighbors. Vaccines can save your own life, but they can also save your grandmother's life, your coworker's life, the grocery store clerk, or the delivery person helping you and your neighbors get through the crisis.
Now, that's why you should get vaccinated. Let me talk about how we're making it easier for you to be able to get vaccinated. First, there are some steps I announced previously that are hitting the ground this week. Ninety percent of the American people now live within 5 miles of a place where they can get a shot.
And under our Federal vaccination program, shots will be available at nearly 40,000 pharmacies coast to coast. And if you can go into a busy—to buy your shampoo or toothpaste, you can stop and get vaccinated. The vaccine is free, it's convenient, and it's increasingly available.
But I know that isn't enough. As we move into the vaccination campaign focused on working-age adults, one concern I've heard from so many Americans is that they can't afford to take the time off to get vaccinated or lose a day's work because they are feeling slightly under the weather after their shot.
So today I'm announcing a program to address that issue nationwide. I'm calling on every employer, large and small, in every State, to give employees the time off they need, with pay, to get vaccinated and any time they need, with pay, to recover if they are feeling under the weather after the shot. No working American should lose a single dollar from their paycheck because they chose to fulfill their patriotic duty of getting vaccinated.
We're already seeing employers, large and small, stepping up to meet this historic moment. The grocery store Krogers offered employees $100 to get vaccinated. It helped push the vaccination rates from 50 percent to 75 percent among their associates.
Patty Young owns a hair salon in Springfield, Ohio. She's also dedicated to getting her customers and employers vaccinated—employees vaccinated that when they leave the saloon, the receptionist—the ""saloon""—the salon—they may be going to the saloon; I don't know. But when—[laughter]. But when the—when they leave the salon, the receptionist helps sign you or your family up to get a COVID vaccine and where to get it. They've scheduled more than 200 shots so far.
Businesses and employers like Patty should be supported for doing the right thing. So, to make sure this policy comes at no cost to small or medium-sized businesses with fewer than 500 employees, the IRS is posting instructions for how employers can get reimbursed for the cost of providing paid leave for their employees to get vaccinated and recover from the side effects if they have any. That reimbursement, which comes through a tax payment, is thanks to the program I launched in the American Rescue Plan.
So again, every employee should get paid leave to get a shot. And businesses should know that they can provide it without a hit to their bottom line. There's no excuse for not getting it done.
In the weeks ahead, I'll have more to say about other new developments in our vaccine program. But we'll also continue moving aggressively to build our progress—build on our progress and race to the finish line here.
But let me close with this: Back on March 11, I outlined a vision of what America could look like by the Fourth of July, an America that was much closer to normal life that we left behind more than a year ago. We remain on track for that goal.
In the week since then, more than 120 million shots have been given since I announced the July 4 proposal. More of our kids are back in school. And, after a long and painful year, more grandparents are able to hug their grandkids again. It's great progress.
But if we let up now and stop being vigilant, this virus will erase the progress we've already achieved, the sacrifices we've made, the lives that been put on hold, the loved ones who've been taken from us, the time we're never going to get back.
To celebrate our independence from this virus on July 4 with family and friends in small groups, we still have more to do in the months of May and June. We all need to mask up until the number of cases goes down, until everyone has a chance to get their shot.
To Americans 16 years and older, it's your turn now. Now. So go get your vaccine before the end of May. We can do this. And we'll do this as long as we don't let up.
Thank you all very much. As I said a long time ago, we're going to beat this as long as we do it together. And I want to again thank my COVID team. I want to thank the Vice President. I want to thank Jeff Zients behind me and the entire COVID team for putting this together.
May God protect our troops. May God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you.
Coronavirus Vaccine Distribution/International Cooperation 
Q. What about rising cases abroad?
Q. Mr. President, do you think that the U.S. has hit the point where decreasing demand for vaccines is now the biggest challenge instead of increasing supply?
The President. Not yet.
But I—and you asked about—what about abroad—helping abroad. We're in the process of doing that. We've done a little bit of that already. We're looking at what is going to be done with some of the vaccines that we are not using. We're going to make sure they are safe to be sent. And we hope to be able to be of some help and value to countries around the world.
We—I've talked to our neighbors. I—matter of fact, a fellow who is working really hard to take care of his country and deal with this I was on the phone with for about a half an hour today. And the Prime Minister of Canada—we helped a little bit there; we're going to try to help some more.
But there's other countries as well that I'm confident we can help, including in Central America. And so—but it's in process. We don't have enough to be confident to give it—send it abroad now. But I expect we're going to be able to do that.
Thank you.

20-Apr-21,"Remarks on the Verdict in the Trial of Former Minneapolis, Minnesota, Police Officer Derek Chauvin in the 2020 Death of George Floyd","Today a jury in Minnesota found former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin guilty on all counts in the murder of George Floyd last May.
It was a murder in the full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see the systemic racism the Vice President just referred to: the systemic racism that is a stain our Nation's soul; the knee on the neck of justice for Black Americans; the profound fear and trauma, the pain, the exhaustion that Black and Brown Americans experience every single day.
The murder of George Floyd launched a summer of protest we hadn't seen since the civil rights era in the sixties, protests that unified people of every race and generation in peace and with purpose to say: ""Enough. Enough. Enough of the senseless killings.""
Today—today's verdict—is a step forward. I just spoke with the Governor of Minnesota, who thanked me for the close work with his team. And I also just spoke with George Floyd's family again, a remarkable family of extraordinary courage. Nothing can ever bring their brother, their father back. But this can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America.
Let's also be clear that such a verdict is also much too rare. For so many people, it seems like it took a unique and extraordinary convergence of factors: a brave young woman with a smartphone camera; a crowd that was traumatized—traumatized witnesses; a murder that lasts almost 10 minutes in broad daylight for, ultimately, the whole world to see; officers standing up and testifying against a fellow officer instead of just closing ranks, which should be commended; a jury who heard the evidence, carried out their civic duty in the midst of an extraordinary moment, under extraordinary pressure.
For so many, it feels like it took all of that for the judicial system to deliver a just—just basic accountability.
We saw how traumatic and exhausting just watching the trial was for so many people. Think about it, those of you who are listening—think about how traumatic it was for you. You weren't there. You didn't know any of the people.
But it was difficult, especially for the witnesses who had to relive that day. It's a trauma on top of the fear so many people of color live with every day when they go to sleep at night and pray for the safety of themselves and their loved ones.
Again—as we saw in this trial, from the fellow police officers who testified—most men and women who wear the badge serve their communities honorably. But those few who fail to meet that standard must be held accountable. And they were today; one was. No one should be above the law. And today's verdict sends that message.
But it's not enough. We can't stop here. In order to deliver real change and reform, we can and we must do more to reduce the likelihood that tragedies like this will ever happen and occur again; to ensure that Black and Brown people or anyone—so they don't fear the interactions with law enforcement, that they don't have to wake up knowing that they can lose their very life in the course of just living their life. They don't have to worry about whether their sons or daughters will come home after a grocery store run or just walking down the street or driving their car or playing in the park or just sleeping at home.
And this takes acknowledging and confronting, head on, systemic racism and the racial disparities that exist in policing and in our criminal justice system more broadly.
You know, State and local government and law enforcement needs to step up, but so does the Federal Government. That's why I have appointed the leadership at the Justice Department that I have, that is fully committed to restoring trust between law enforcement and the community they are sworn to serve and protect. I have complete confidence in the Attorney General—General Garland's leadership and commitment.
I have also nominated two key Justice Department nominees—Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke—who are eminently qualified, highly respected lawyers who have spent their entire careers fighting to advance racial equity and justice. Vanita and Kristen have the experience and the skill necessary to advance our administration's priorities to root out unconstitutional policing and reform our criminal justice system, and they deserve to be confirmed.
We also need Congress to act. George Floyd was murdered almost a year ago. There's meaningful police reform legislation in his name. You just heard the Vice President speak of it. She helped write it. Legislation to tackle systemic misconduct in police departments, to restore trust between law enforcement and the people that are entrusted to serve and protect. But it shouldn't take a whole year to get this done.
In my conversations with the Floyd family—and I spoke with them again today—I assured them that we're going to continue to fight for the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act so we can—I can sign it into law as quickly as possible. And there's more to do.
Finally, it's the work we do every day to change hearts and minds as well as laws and policies—that's the work we have to do. Only then will full justice and full equality be delivered to all Americans. And that's what I just discussed with the Floyd family.
The guilty verdict does not bring back George. But through the family's pain, they're finding purpose so George's legacy will not be just about his death, but about what we must do in his memory.
I also spoke to Gianna, George's young daughter, again. When I met her last year—I've said this before—at George's funeral, I told her how brave I thought she was. And I, sort of, knelt down to hold her hand. I said: ""Daddy's looking down on you. He's so proud."" She said to me then—I'll never forget it—""Daddy changed the world.""
Well, I told her this afternoon, ""Daddy did change the world."" Let that be his legacy: a legacy of peace, not violence—of justice. Peaceful expression of that legacy are inevitable and appropriate, but violent protest is not. And there are those who will seek to exploit the raw emotions of the moment, agitators and extremists who have no interest in social justice; who seek to carry out violence, destroy property, to fan the flames of hate and division; who will do everything in their power to stop this country's march toward racial justice. We can't let them succeed.
This is the time for this country to come together, to unite as Americans. There can never be any safe harbor for hate in America. I've said it many times: The battle for the soul of this Nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.
At our best, the American ideal wins out. So we can't leave this moment or look away, thinking our work is done. We have to look at it as we did for those 9 minutes and 29 seconds. We have to listen. ""I can't breathe. I can't breathe."" Those were George Floyd's last words. We can't let those words die with him. We have to keep hearing those words.
We must not turn away. We can't turn away. We have a chance to begin to change the trajectory in this country. It's my hope and prayer that we live up to the legacy.
May God bless you, and may God bless the—George Floyd and his family. Thank you for taking the time to be here. This can be a moment of significant change. Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 7:11 p.m. in the Cross Hall at the White House.

20-Apr-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Hispanic Caucus Leadership and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Thanks for taking the time to come in. We're having a very important meeting. There's a lot on our agenda from the CHC. We've got a lot to talk about.
Representatives from the House and the Senate—and I wanted to express my gratitude to the Caucus for being willing to come down. We've got a whole range of issues to discuss. And you know, I want to make sure that—from the American Rescue Plan, to COVID—I told the doc that I—if I hadn't had my shot already, I'd ask him to give me one because he's been taking care of business.
But the America—in our view, and I mean it sincerely—cannot succeed if it's—unless Hispanic families succeed. You know, we talk about—I know I'm tired of hearing me say it for a year and a half—we talk about the idea that—with the last administration's failure to invest or being even—be anywhere remotely positive.
But I—the point I keep making, to remind people—and people understand it, and the recent polling nationwide shows they understand it—is that 24 out of every 100 kids in grade school right now is a Latino or Hispanic. The idea that we're not going to invest in what will be roughly 25 percent of the population by the time these kids are in our positions, it's just absolutely—it makes no sense. And that's what we're all about.
We're going to talk about everything today, my guess is, from immigration to the—my Jobs Plan and what—how it worked for you and how it didn't, what you think we should be doing.
We're also creating a whole lot ofjob opportunities in neighborhoods, because for most of the—where I come from and all of you come from—is that it gets down to neighborhoods—it gets down to neighborhoods—whether that grocery store is open, whether that local bank is there, whether the—whether or not you have a barber shop, a beauty shop. It all matters. It matters about people and their communities and how they belong.
So we're going to spend some time pushing forward—I'm going to spend some time trying to sell you all on what I think you're sold on with the jobs bill and the aspects of the jobs bill. And I want to talk a little strategy with you all as well, if that's okay. If that's all right with you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Robert Menendez. Whatever you say, Mr. President.
The President. All right. The chairman is now chairman of the committee that I enjoyed more than anything I did in my whole career; he's chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
So the Vice President and I are looking forward to this meeting, and we're going to try to get a lot done. And I think it's always great when a meeting starts off in a meeting with a bunch of friends. [Laughter]
So thank you all for being here. That's what we're going to be talking about today. Thank you.
Trial of Former Police Officer Derek Chauvin in the Death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25, 2020 
Q. President Biden, you spoke to George Floyd's family; what was your message?
The President. I know, George—I'm just going to answer that one question because George is—I've come to know George's family not just in passing—I've spent time with them. I spent time with his little daughter Gianna—you should see this beautiful child; and his brother—both brothers, as a matter of fact.
And so I can only imagine the pressure and anxiety they're feeling. And so I waited until the jury was sequestered, and—I called. And as—I wasn't going to say anything about it, but Philonise said today on television, and he accurately said—it was a private conversation—because Joe understands what it's like to go through loss.
And they're a good family. And they're calling for peace and tranquility no matter what that verdict is. I'm praying the verdict is the right verdict, which is—I think it's overwhelming, in my view. I wouldn't say that unless the jury was sequestered now and not hearing me say that.
But—so we just talked a little. I wanted to know how they were doing, just personally. And we talked about personal things.
Thank you very much for coming in.","NOTE: The President spoke at 11:43 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Rep.

We're going to talk about our infrastructure package. And as I indicated earlier, I am prepared to compromise, prepared to see what we can do and what we can get together on. It's a big package, but there's a lot of needs.
And so we're going to be talking about, number one, what should be included in the package—obviously, I put a lot in the package; I think it all should be included—and how to pay for it. And there are two issues.
I've noticed everybody is for infrastructure. [Laughter] The question is: Who's going to pay for it? And that's what we're going to try to work out today, at least in this bipartisan group of Members of the House and Senate.
And, a little secret here, we're going to—in full disclosure, I asked Senators and Congressmen who had either been Governors or mayors because they know what it's like to make things work, to make sure that you get things done and deal with infrastructure and the needs of your community.

So I'm looking forward to speaking with the Prime Minister. And our teams are tackling a shared agenda. We are ready to get to work.
So welcome, Mr. Prime Minister. As we say in the body I used to work in, the United States Senate, ""I yield the floor"" to the Prime Minister. It's all yours, Yoshi.
Prime Minister Suga. Thank you very much. Thank for you for accepting me as the first foreign leader under your Presidency. My deepest gratitude to you.
And yesterday there was a shooting in Indianapolis, so I heard, and causing much casualty. I would like to express my condolences to the victims and my sympathies to the families. Innocent citizens must not be exposed to any such violence.
Freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law are the universal values that link our alliance that is prevalent in the Indo-Pacific, and this is the very foundation of prosperity and stability of the region and the globe. And the importance of such values has heightened to unprecedented level.
And upon my visit to the United States, I wish to reaffirm the new and tight bond between us. And in order to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific, there are many common challenges as well as emerging global issues, including COVID-19 and climate change.

15-Apr-21,Remarks on Russia-United States Relations and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Hello, folks. Thanks for coming over. Good afternoon, everyone.
Earlier this week, I spoke with President Putin of Russia about the nature of our relationship, the relationship between our two countries. And I was candid and respectful; the conversation was candid and respectful.
Two great powers with significant responsibility for global stability. And President Putin and I have had a significant responsibility to steward that relationship. I take that responsibility very seriously, as I'm sure he does. Russia and Americans are both proud and patriotic people. And I believe the Russian people, like the American people, are invested in peaceful and a secure future of our world.
During the campaign for my—for the Presidency, I was unequivocal that if I was elected President, I would respond to any attempt to influence our elections—the last election and—because elections are sacred. They're sovereign undertakings, and they're an expression of the will of the American people, and we cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity. And I told him: If it turned out that the invest—as I thought—that there was engagement in our elections, that I would—that I'd respond.
Later, during the transition, as we learned more about the SolarWinds cyber intrusion, I made clear that I would respond once we determined who had, in fact, conducted a hack on the scope and scale that occurred.
When President Putin called me in January, after I was sworn in, to congratulate me, I told him that my administration—we were looking very carefully, now that we had access to all the data, and at the issues that—to assess Russia's role and then determine what response we would make.
When we spoke again this week, I told him that we would shortly be responding in a measured and proportionate way because we had concluded that they had interfered in the election, and SolarWinds was totally out of the—inappropriate.
Today I've approved several steps, including expulsion of several Russian officials, as a consequence of their actions. I've also signed an Executive order authorizing new measures, including sanctions to address specific harmful actions that Russia has taken against U.S. interests.
I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so, to be—I chose to be proportionate. The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship.
If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I'm prepared to take further actions to respond. It is my responsibility, as President of the United States, to do so. But throughout our long history of competition, our two countries have been able to find ways to manage tensions and to keep them from escalating out of control.
There are also areas where Russia and the United States can and should work together. For example, in the earliest days of my administration, we were able to move quickly to extend, for 5 years, the New START Treaty, and maintain that key element of nuclear stability between our nations. That was in the interest of the United States, of Russia, and quite frankly, of the world, and we got it done.
When I spoke to President Putin, I expressed my belief that communication between the two of us, personally and directly, was to be essential in moving forward to a more effective relationship. And he agreed on that point. To that end, I proposed that we meet in person this summer in Europe, for a summit to address a range of issues facing both of our countries. Our teams are discussing that possibility right now.
And out of that summit—were it to occur, and I believe it will—the United States and Russia could launch a strategic stability dialogue to pursue cooperation in arms control and security. We can address critical global challenges that require Russia and the United States to work together, including reining in nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea, ending this pandemic globally, and meeting the existential crisis of climate change.
I also made clear to President Clutin that the United—Putin—that the United States is unwavering in our support of our allies and partners in Europe. In that vein, I expressed concern about Russia's military buildup on Ukraine's border and occupied—and in occupied Crimea. I affirmed U.S. support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. And I strongly urged him to refrain from any military action.
Now is the time to de-escalate. The way forward is through thoughtful dialogue and diplomatic process. The U.S. is prepared to continue constructively to move forward that process.
My bottom line is this: Where it is in the interest of the United States to work with Russia, we should, and we will. Where Russia seeks to violate the interests of the United States, we will respond. And we'll always stand in defense of our country, our institutions, our people, and our allies.
Thank you very much for your time.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. Mr. President, did President Putin give you any indication in that call that he is willing to change his behavior?
The President. We indicated we would talk about it. I laid out, as I said, very simply—I told—I said during the campaign; I said when he called to congratulate me on being elected; I said, subsequent to that, this last conversation, that if it turned out that he was engaged in the activities that he'd been accused of in cybersecurity and SolarWinds and interfering in our elections that I would respond in kind.
I urged him to respond appropriately, not to exceed it, because we can move as well. My hope and expectation is, we'll be able to work out a modus vivendi. And—but it's important that we have direct talks and that we continue to be in contact with one another.
Thank you.
Q. Why not—on Nord Stream——
Q. Mr. President, do you expect to have a summit?
The President. Pardon me?
Russia-Germany Nord Stream II Natural Gas Pipeline 
Q. Why not—on Nord Stream, why didn't you keep going with the sanction—sanctions on Nord Stream 2, Mr. President?
The President. Nord Stream 2 is a complicated issue affecting our allies in Europe. I've been opposed to Nord Stream 2 for a long time, from the beginning, when I was even—when I was out of office and even before office, when we—before I left office as Vice President. But that still is an issue that is in play.

15-Apr-21,Remarks Prior to Meeting With the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Executive Committee and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Hey, everybody.
National Economy 
Before we get started, I want to make it clear that we have some good news today, and that is that retail sales this last month have surged by 9.8 percent as American families received that $1,400 check because of the people in this room are getting it done for me. And auto sales are up 15 percent. Things are moving.
And these checks are providing a heck of a lot of needed relief for families and, in turn, needed support for our economic recovery. And today's news comes on top of the recent news that we created 900,000 jobs in this—in the month of March.
The first 2 months of our administration, we've created more jobs than the first 2 months of any administration in American history. And again—I'm not being solicitous—it's because of you all. I really mean it. The way you fought like the devil to get—you really did—to get that package passed. I mean, it really did.
And I want to thank the Members for supporting the American Rescue Plan. And we still have a long way to go. We're 8 million jobs down from what it was more than—before the pandemic began, but America is coming back.
Meeting With the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Executive Committee 
And with regard to—I want to express my gratitude to the group we have here today from the House representing this Caucus, which represents vital communities and very diverse communities within the Asian American, Hawaiian—excuse me—and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders community.
And what I think what most people don't realize is just how diverse it is; how broad it is; how many different dialects, languages, and the like are spoken, which is part of what we have to deal with and solve. And we need to stand with the AAPI community and the whole-of-Government response with what we have to get done.
When I came into office, the first bill I signed related to racial equity throughout the Government. That's still the plan. That's my objective. And Kamala and I are heartened by the Senate's overwhelming bipartisan effort yesterday, Senator, for the passage of the Hate Crimes Act. That's a big deal. I mean, it was really close. Only—what?—98 votes. [Laughter]
Senator Mazie K. Hirono. Long way to go yet.
The President. But I'll tell you what——
Sen. Hirono. But it was really nice. [Laughter]
The President. Well, it was now. I thought it was going to pass, but, my Lord, you—I tell you. I—and we took a vote here in the administration: You're going to handle the jobs bill—[laughter]—because anybody who can get 98 votes for anything——
Sen. Hirono. Why, sure. [Laughter]
The President. So, anyway, I'm looking forward to our discussion with the Caucus. And I just want to thank you all for being here. And thank you for coming in, press.

Bravery of U.S. Servicemembers 
Q. Mr. President, what does this moment mean to you?
The President. It means that I—I'm always amazed at generation after generation, the women and men who are prepared to give their lives for their country. But they don't give it for their country, per se; they give it for their brothers, their sisters, their mothers, their fathers, their uncles, their aunts.
And I—it means that I have trouble these days ever showing up at a veterans cemetery and not thinking of my son Beau, who proudly insisted on putting on that uniform and going with his unit to Iraq and giving up his spot as attorney general of the State of Delaware because he thought it was the right thing to do.

14-Apr-21,Remarks on United States Military Operations in Afghanistan,"Good afternoon.
I'm speaking to you today from the Roosevelt—the Treaty Room in the White House. The same spot where, on October of 2001, President George W. Bush informed our Nation that the United States military had begun strikes on terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. It was just weeks—just weeks—after the terrorist attack on our Nation that killed 2,977 innocent souls; that turned Lower Manhattan into a disaster area, destroyed parts of the Pentagon, and made hallowed ground of a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and sparked an American promise that we would ""never forget.""
We went to Afghanistan in 2001 to root out Al Qaida, to prevent future terrorist attacks against the United States planned from Afghanistan. Our objective was clear. The cause was just. Our NATO allies and partners rallied beside us. And I supported that military action, along with overwhelming majority of the Members of Congress.
More than 7 years later, in 2008, weeks before we swore the oath of office—President Obama and I were about to swear—President Obama asked me to travel to Afghanistan and report back on the state of the war in Afghanistan. I flew to Afghanistan, to the Kunar Valley, a rugged, mountainous region on the border with Pakistan. What I saw on that trip reinforced my conviction that only the Afghans have the right and responsibility to lead their country and that more and endless American military force could not create or sustain a durable Afghan Government.
I believed that our presence in Afghanistan should be focused on the reason we went in the first place: to ensure Afghanistan would not be used as a base from which to attack our homeland again. We did that. We accomplished that objective.
I said, among—with others, we'd follow Usama bin Laden to the gates of hell if need be. That's exactly what we did, and we got him. It took us close to 10 years to put President Obama's commitment to—into form. And that's exactly what happened; Usama bin Laden was gone.
That was 10 years ago. Think about that. We delivered justice to bin Laden a decade ago, and we've stayed in Afghanistan for a decade since. Since then, our reasons for remaining in Afghanistan are becoming increasingly unclear, even as the terrorist threat that we went to fight evolved.
Over the past 20 years, the threat has become more dispersed, metastasizing around the globe: al-Shabaab in Somalia; Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Nusra in Syria; ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and establishing affiliates in multiple countries in Africa and Asia.
With the terror threat now in many places, keeping thousands of troops grounded and concentrated in just one country at a cost of billions each year makes little sense to me and to our leaders. We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan, hoping to create ideal conditions for the withdrawal, and expecting a different result.
I'm now the fourth United States President to preside over American troop presence in Afghanistan: two Republicans, two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility on to a fifth. After consulting closely with our allies and partners, with our military leaders and intelligence personnel, with our diplomats and our development experts, with the Congress and the Vice President, as well as with Mr. Ghani and many others around the world, I have concluded that it's time to end America's longest war. It's time for American troops to come home.
When I came to office, I inherited a diplomatic agreement, duly negotiated between the Government of the United States and the Taliban, that all U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021, just 3 months after my Inauguration. That's what we inherited, that commitment.
It is perhaps not what I would have negotiated myself, but it was an agreement made by the United States Government, and that means something. So, in keeping with that agreement and with our national interests, the United States will begin our final withdrawal—begin it—on May 1 of this year.
We will not conduct a hasty rush to the exit. We'll do it responsibly, deliberately, and safely. And we will do it in full coordination with our allies and partners, who now have more forces in Afghanistan than we do.
And the Taliban should know that if they attack us as we draw down, we will defend ourselves and our partners with all the tools at our disposal.
Our allies and partners have stood beside us shoulder to shoulder in Afghanistan for almost 20 years, and we're deeply grateful for the contributions they have made to our shared mission and for the sacrifices they have borne.
The plan has long been ""in together, out together."" U.S. troops, as well as forces deployed by our NATO allies and operational partners, will be out of Afghanistan before we mark the 20th anniversary of that heinous attack on September 11.
But we'll not take our eye off the terrorist threat. We'll reorganize our counterterrorism capabilities and the substantial assets in the region to prevent reemergence of terrorists—of the threat to our homeland from over the horizon. We'll hold the Taliban accountable for its commitment not to allow any terrorists to threaten the United States or its allies from Afghan soil. The Afghan Government has made that commitment to us as well. And we'll focus our full attention on the threat we face today.
At my direction, my team is refining our national strategy to monitor and disrupt significant terrorist threats not only in Afghanistan, but anywhere they may arise—and they're in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere.
I spoke yesterday with President Bush to inform him of my decision. While he and I have had many disagreements over policies throughout the years, we're absolutely united in our respect and support for the valor, courage, and integrity of the women and men of the United States Armed Forces who served. I'm immensely grateful for the bravery and backbone that they have shown through nearly two decades of combat deployments. We as a Nation are forever indebted to them and to their families.
You all know that less than 1 percent of Americans serve in our Armed Forces. The remaining 99 percent of them—we owe them. We owe them. They have never backed down from a single mission that we've asked of them. I've witnessed their bravery firsthand during my visits to Afghanistan. They've never wavered in their resolve. They've paid a tremendous price on our behalf. And they have the thanks of a grateful nation.
While we will not stay involved in Afghanistan militarily, our diplomatic and humanitarian work will continue. We'll continue to support the Government of Afghanistan. We will keep providing assistance to the Afghan National Defenses and Security Forces.
And along with our partners, we have trained and equipped a standing force of over 300,000 Afghan personnel today and hundreds of thousands over the past two decades. And they'll continue to fight valiantly, on behalf of the Afghans, at great cost. They'll support peace talks, as we will support peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, facilitated by the United Nations. And we'll continue to support the rights of Afghan women and girls by maintaining significant humanitarian and development assistance.
And we'll ask other countries—other countries in the region—to do more to support Afghanistan, especially Pakistan, as well as Russia, China, India, and Turkey. They all have a significant stake in the stable future for Afghanistan.
And, over the next few months, we will also determine what a continued U.S. diplomatic presence in Afghanistan will look like, including how we'll ensure the security of our diplomats.
Now, look, I know there are many who will loudly insist that diplomacy cannot succeed without a robust U.S. military presence to stand as leverage. We gave that argument a decade. It's never proved effective, not when we had 98,000 troops in Afghanistan and not when we were down to a few thousand.
Our diplomacy does not hinge on having boots in harm's way, U.S. boots on the ground. We have to change that thinking. American troops shouldn't be used as a bargaining chip between warring parties in other countries. You know, that's nothing more than a recipe for keeping American troops in Afghanistan indefinitely.
I also know there are many who will argue that we should stay fighting in Afghanistan because withdrawal would damage America's credibility and weaken America's influence in the world. I believe the exact opposite is true. We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago. That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021.
Rather than return to war with the Taliban, we have to focus on the challenges that are in front of us. We have to track and disrupt terrorist networks and operations that spread far beyond Afghanistan since 9/11. We have to shore up American competitiveness to meet the stiff competition we're facing from an increasingly assertive China.
We have to strengthen our alliances and work with like-minded partners to ensure that the rules of international norms that govern cyber threats and emerging technologies that will shape our future are grounded in our democratic values, not those of the autocrats. We have to defeat this pandemic and strengthen the global health system to prepare for the next one, because there will be another pandemic.
You know, we'll be much more formidable to our adversaries and competitors over the long term if we fight the battles for the next 20 years, not the last 20.
And finally, the main argument for staying longer is what each of my three predecessors have grappled with: No one wants to say that we should be in Afghanistan forever, but they insist now is not the right moment to leave.
In 2014, NATO issued a declaration affirming that Afghan Security Forces would, from that point on, have full responsibility for their country's security by the end of that year. That was 7 years ago. So when will it be the right moment to leave? One more year, 2 more years, 10 more years? Ten, twenty, thirty billion dollars more above the trillion we've already spent?
""Not now""—that's how we got here. And, in this moment, there's a significant downside risk to staying beyond May 1 without a clear timetable for departure.
If we instead pursue the approach where America—U.S. exit is tied to conditions on the ground, we have to have clear answers to the following questions: Just what conditions require to—be required to allow us to depart? By what means and how long would it take to achieve them, if they could be achieved at all? And at what additional cost in lives and treasure?
I'm not hearing any good answers to these questions. And if you can't answer them, in my view, we should not stay. The fact is that later today I'm going to visit Arlington National Cemetery, Section 60, and that sacred memorial to American sacrifice. Section 60 is where our recent war dead are buried, including many of the women and men who died fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. There's no comforting distance in history in Section 60. The grief is raw. It's a visceral reminder of the living cost of war.
For the past 12 years, ever since I became Vice President, I've carried with me a card that reminds me of the exact number of American troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. That exact number, not an approximation or rounded-off number—because every one of those dead are sacred human beings who left behind entire families. An exact accounting of every single solitary one needs to be had.
As of the day—today, there are two-hundred-and-forty—2,488 [2,448]* U.S. troops and personnel who have died in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Freedom's Sentinel—our Afghanistan conflicts; 20,722 have been wounded.
I'm the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a child serving in a war zone. And throughout this process, my north star has been remembering what it was like when my late son Beau was deployed to Iraq—how proud he was to serve his country; how insistent he was to deploy with his unit; and the impact it had on him and all of us at home.
We already have servicemembers doing their duty in Afghanistan today whose parents served in the same war. We have servicemembers who were not yet born when our Nation was attacked on 9/11.
War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multigenerational undertaking. We were attacked. We went to war with clear goals. We achieved those objectives. Bin Laden is dead, and Al Qaida is degraded in Iraq—in Afghanistan. And it's time to end the forever war.
Thank you all for listening. May God protect our troops. May God bless all those families who lost someone in this endeavor.","NOTE: The President spoke at 2:29 p.m. in the Treaty Room at the White House.

13-Apr-21,Remarks Prior to Meeting With Members of the Congressional Black Caucus and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Well, look, it's an honor to be with all of you today, and II know it's been a pretty painful week, you know, with the losses we've had. You know, a good friend, Alcee Hastings, which I knew a long, long time. And to lose him is losing a piece of the—I don't know what—just losing a piece of something.
And also, you know, with Daunte Wright in Minnesota—that God-awful shooting and resulting in his death—and in the midst of an ongoing trial over the killing of George Floyd. And Lord only knows what's happened based on what the verdict will or will not be there.
And—but we're in the business, all of us meeting today, to deliver some real change. When we took office—I had a talk with Jim at length about this—every single aspect of—I signed the Executive order—every single aspect of our Government, including every agency, has, as a primary focus, dealing with equity. And not a joke. From the beginning, we talked at length about it, Jim.
And not only is—but we also have an awful lot of things we have to deal with, not—when it comes to police, when it comes to advancing equality, economic opportunity. Cedric always says the thing that he—would drive him crazy is that everybody, when we want to talk about equity in the Black community, they talk about prisons. Well, that's part of it, man, but that's not—it's about income. It's about being able to earn a living. It's about being able to be in a position where you have economic opportunity.
And so I look forward to discussing all these priorities, the CBC priorities and the goals you have for the community, but quite frankly, for—the goals you have for the community are good for every community—for every community.
And I'd like to take some—spend some time in the American Jobs Act, which I think some of you actually helped me put that together with the ideas you gave me early on. And I think we can make significant, significant changes.
We—in the last little bit of legislation you helped me pass, we've reduced child poverty, and we reduced poverty in Black communities significantly, just by that act alone. One of my objectives there is—overall objectives is to make those changes permanent. You've been leading that one for a long time, pal.
And so—anyway, we've got a lot to talk about. And I'm looking forward to having this meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. And they—I think we can get a lot done.
So thank you all for joining us.
Q. Mr. President——
Q. Mr. President, a question about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.

Law Enforcement's Interactions With the African American Community 
Q. Mr. President, what is the actual hope that people should have that there'll be a change in the way that African Americans interact with police in this country during the Biden era? What can you deliver on, sir?
The President. A lot. And I'll tell you later. Let's go.
Coronavirus Vaccine Availability 
Q. Any response to the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?
The President. My message to the American people on the vaccine is—I told you all: I made sure we have 600 million doses of the MR—not of either Johnson and Johnson and/or AstraZeneca. So there's enough vaccine that is basically a hundred-percent unquestionable for every single, solitary American.

13-Apr-21,Remarks at a Congressional Tribute for United States Capitol Police Officer William F. Evans,"Madam Speaker; Majority Leader Schumer; Minority Leader McCarthy; my friend, Minority Leader McConnell; Members of Congress; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley; Attorney General Garland; Mayor Bowser; all the Capitol Hill Police and all that are here to pay tribute to this Capitol policeman who fell in the line of duty; Acting Chief Pittman, and the men and women of the Capitol Police force: I'm sorry: the second time in 2 months we have such a ceremony.
And you know, Mom, I didn't know Billy, but I knew Billy. I grew up with Billys in Claymont and Scranton, Pennsylvania. Billy was always the kid that you know if you got in a fight and you're outnumbered three to one, he'd still jump in, knowing you'd both get beaten.
He was the one who always kept his word. If he said he'd be there, he'd be there. He was the one who was just like the folks I grew up with, wasn't capable of saying no when you needed him.
You know, just like you, Officer Kenny Shaver, who was injured in the attack with Billy. And never has there been more strain—and I've been here a long time; I've been here since 1972 as U.S. Senator—'73—has so much strain and responsibility been placed on the shoulders of the Capitol Police. And yet you hear it, you see it, you watch them, and you watch them do their duty with pure courage and not complain.
You know, Sergeant Kyle King, I'm sorry you had to make the call—that telephone call that every family dreads when they have a son or daughter, husband, wife, brother, sister in uniform. Because every morning they pin that badge on, go to work, they expect to come home. In the back of your minds, ""We'll never get that call.""
You knew Billy since grade school. I think it was in fourth grade. I've got to deal with all the guys that I grew up and knew in fourth grade. When one passes away, the other one has to give up because he has too much information about you, too much to leave behind. [Laughter] But you know, I'm sure all those memories from North Adams and Clarksburg never changed who Billy was. He was defined by his dignity, his decency, his loyalty, and his courage. And, Mom, that's because of you and his dad. That's how it happened, not by accident.
Ms. Evans, you have—I have some idea of what you're feeling like. I buried two of my children. And people have come up to you and are going to come up to you for some time and say, ""I know how you feel."" They're going to say that to sis. They're going to say that to the kids. They're going to say that to his former wife. And after a while—you know everybody means well—you feel like saying, ""You have no idea.""
But the truth is that a time is going to come, I promise you—not believable now—when a memory, a fragrance, a scene, a circumstance, the way his son tilts his head the way he did when he was that age—it's going to bring back the memory. And for the longest time, it's going to feel like, at that moment, that memory—it's going to feel like you got the phone call just that moment ago. And there are going to be people celebrating Billy's life. And as much as you appreciate it—all of you—it also is hard; you relive everything again. And you know, I got a phone call when I first got here and lost my family—part of my family—from a person I never knew, never met: the former Governor of New Jersey, who was literally 40—45 years my senior. And he told me he knew how I felt. And I didn't say anything.
He said, ""I know what you're thinking."" He said, ""But I did know."" He said: ""I used to come home—I was the attorney general of New Jersey before I was Governor. And I'd come home for lunch because I lived just across the green from my office. And one day, a woman who helped out at our home came running across the green saying, 'She's gone. She's gone.'""
His wife had had an aneurysm. And he said, ""You know what I did?"" He said, ""I kept a—I got graph paper, and 4 months out, I would put the month on it and then a horizontal line. I'd put the date and the month. In the vertical line, I put the numbers 1 to 10. Ten would be the happiest day of my life, and one would be like the moment I got the phone call.""
And he said: ""And every night before I'd go to bed, I'd graph it. I'd put on a dot on that day where I was."" And he said, ""Don't look at it for 3 or 4 months."" He said, ""And you'll look at it and you'll see."" He'd put it on a graph. ""The downs are just as far down, but they get further and further and further apart.""
That's how you're all going to know that you're going to make it: by holding each other together, and most importantly, by holding Logan and Abigail as tightly as you can. Because as long as you have them, you've got Billy. As long as you have them.
You know, my prayer for all of you is that a day will come when you have that memory, and I've said, ""Just smile before you bring a tear to your eyes."" It's—I promise you it's going to come. It just takes a while. It takes a while.
But when it comes, you'll know, because he's still with you. He's still in your heart. Losing a son, daughter, brother, sister, mom, dad—it's like losing a piece of your soul. But it's buried deep, but it comes back.
There's a great quote by R.G. Ingersoll. It was read when my son, who was the chief law enforcement officer in the State of Delaware—the attorney general—came back from Iraq after a year, and he died. And they read this poem from R.G. Ingersoll, who said, ""When will defies fear, when duty throws the gauntlet down to fate, when honor scorns compromise with death, this is heroism.""
Your son, your husband, your brother, your dad was a hero. And he's part of you. It's in your blood. My prayer for you is that moment when a smile comes before the tear, quicker than longer.
Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 11:30 a.m. in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol.

12-Apr-21,Remarks Prior to Meeting With Members of Congress on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Hello, everybody.
Police-Involved Shooting of Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota/Protests and Civil Unrest in Metropolitan Minneapolis 
I told you a moment ago that I would comment briefly on what happened in Minnesota last night. We've spoken to the Governor and the mayor. I've spoken to the authorities there.
And I haven't called Daunte Wright's family, but our prayers are with the family. It was a really tragic thing that happened. We're—and—but I think we've got to wait and see what the investigation shows—and the entire investigation.
You've all watched, I assume—as I did—the film, which is fairly—the body cam—which is fairly graphic. The question is: Was it an accident? Was it intentional? That remains to be determined by a full-blown investigation.
But, in the meantime, I want to make it clear again: There is absolutely no justification—none—for looting, no justification for violence. Peaceful protest, understandable.
And the fact is that, you know, we do know that the anger, pain, and trauma that exists in the Black community in that environment is real, it's serious, and it's consequential. But it doesn't—it will not justify violence and/or looting.
And so, the question is how we, in an orderly way, make clear that they get down to a full-blown investigation to determine what the facts are and what is likely to have happened.
In the meantime, we're calling for peace and calm. And we should listen to Daunte's mom, who is calling for peace and calm.
And that's all I have to say at this moment on that issue. So——
Protests and Civil Unrest in Metropolitan Minneapolis/Trial of Former Police Officer Derek Chauvin in the Death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25, 2020 
Q. Mr. President, do you think there should be Federal resources to help keep the peace? Do you think you need to take any additional steps?
The President. There are already Federal resources. And we have a significant—we've spent a significant amount of time, unrelating to this particular case, in dealing with what may be the aftermath of anything that happens with the trial that's underway.
But there will not be lack of help and support from the Federal Government if the local authorities believe it's needed. I hope it's not.
Q. Are you concerned things could be on a razor's edge, sir?
The President. I'm not going to speculate now. I'm hopeful that there will be a verdict and an outcome that will be supported by the vast majority of the people in the region. And that's my expectation and hope.
Thank you.
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, do you want to speak on infrastructure?
The President. Thank you. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, do you want to speak on infrastructure at all, sir?
The President. I think—that's why we're here. It's a bipartisan meeting here. We've got the Dean here. Don Young is here. We've got the Dean. [Laughter] So everything is going to be all right.
But, all kidding aside, we're—we're—I'm prepared to negotiate as to how—the extent of the—my infrastructure project, as well as how we pay for it. But I—if we get in a serious conversation about how to do that.
I think everyone acknowledges we need significant increase in infrastructure. It's going to get down to what we call infrastructure. Some people don't think that—I'm not suggesting anybody here has that view, but there's a lot of folks saying that the fact that we have millions of people not able to drink water because there's lead in the—there—it's coming through lead pipes—I think that's infrastructure. I think broadband is infrastructure. It's not just roads, bridges, highways, et cetera.
So that's what we're going to talk about, and I'm confident everything is going to work out perfectly. [Laughter]
Bipartisanship 
Q. Mr. President, some Republicans—some Republicans say that they're concerned about being ""window dressing,"" Mr. President.

12-Apr-21,Remarks at a Virtual CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain Resilience and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Well, look, the reason I'm here today is—all of these technology manufacturing leaders around the country and all over the world on the screen—is to talk about how we strengthen our domestic semiconductor industry and secure America's supply chain.
This is an issue that has broad support in United States Congress. We've talked about whether or not we're doing anything in terms of bipartisanly. Well, we are. Both sides of the aisle are strongly supportive of what we're proposing, and I—and where I think we can really get things done for the American people.
In fact, today I received a letter from 23 Senators—bipartisanly—and 42 House Members—Republican and Democrats—supporting the CHIPS for America program. Now, let me quote from the letter. It says, ""the Chinese Communist Party has—aggressively plans to reorient and dominate the semiconductor supply chain . . ."" And it goes into how much money they're pouring in to being able to be able to do that. But I've just—I've been saying for some time now: China and the rest of the world is not waiting, and there's no reason why Americans should wait.
We're investing aggressively in areas like semiconductors and batteries. That's what they're doing and others; so must we. We are seeking a significant investment in the—in this piece of legislation. And it's important, but we know it's not sufficient.
The American Jobs Plan that I've put forward is part of—about revitalizing American manufacturing and securing our supply chains, investing in research and development, as we used to, in a very healthy manner.
But it's also about much more than that. It's about investing in infrastructure and infrastructure not for the 20th century, but the 21st century. It's not just roads and bridges. We're investing in water systems so Americans can have clean water infrastructure. We're investing in high-speed rail infrastructure. We're building charging stations to support America's electric future—electric vehicle future and investing in that infrastructure; and building out America's supply chains so we never again are at the mercy of another country or any other nation for the critical needs. That's what we would mean by investing in infrastructure.
And we're investing in a more resilient grid, investing—I understand you discussed that a little bit earlier today. Investing as well in asbestos-free schools for our kids, that's investing in infrastructure. Building a support system to take care of our elderly parents and our kids with disabilities at home so that people can go to work, that's investing in infrastructure.
Chips, like the one I have here——
[At this point, the President displayed a wafer as a visual example.]
——these chips, these wafers, or batteries, broadband, it's all infrastructure. This is infrastructure.
So, look, we need to build the infrastructure of today, not repair the one of yesterday. And the plan I propose is going to create millions of jobs, rebuild America, protect our supply chains, and revitalize American manufacturing. And it's going to make American research and development a great engine again. We led the world in the middle of the 20th century. We led the world toward the end of the century. We're going to lead the world again. We're going to lead it again in the 21st century. We're—we have the best minds in the country; many of them are on the screen right now. And they know better than anyone that our competitiveness depends on where you invest and how you invest.
For too long as a nation, we haven't been making the big, bold investments we need to outpace our global competitors. We've been falling behind on research and development and manufacturing. And put it bluntly, we have to step up our game.
And I'm not ready to give up. I'm ready to work with all of you, with the Congress—both parties—to pass the American Jobs Plan and to make a once-in-a-generation investment in America's future.
Again, we'll provide the innovation and spur breakthroughs. And we need the support—all your support—on the screen and others, in order to get this work done. And we need you, in turn, to support the American workers and American communities in every part of the country.
This is a moment for American strength and American unity; for government, industries, communities to work together to make sure that we're ready to meet the global competition that lies ahead, not continuing to slide in terms of our investment. We're ranked, like, number 25th in the world now. That's not American.
So I want to thank you all very much. And I appreciate all the time you've given us.

9-Apr-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Economic Advisers,"Death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, of the United Kingdom 
Well, first of all, Jill and I, and the entire administration, send our condolences to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the loss of Prince Philip. He was a heck of a guy. He—you know, he was—in his lifetime of service to the United Kingdom and the whole Commonwealth was visible to everybody for a long, long time, and his bravery serving in World War II, as well as his being a champion of the environment, as well as the charity—the charitable things he set up.
So we really do express our condolences for an extraordinary life that was led by the Prince. And it—I think he's going to be missed, particularly in the United Kingdom. Ninety-nine years old, and he never slowed down at all, and—which I admire the devil out of.
Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Guidance 
And today we're meeting on—we're having an economic briefing here with the team. I sent to Congress my funding priorities for the appropriations process, including two key public health initiatives that I'm pushing.
The first is—like DARPA in the Defense Department, which was designed to develop, and has developed, breakthroughs to protect us and enhance our physical safety—I'm proposing a $6.5 billion appropriation for what we call ""ARPA-H,"" which is focused on going to—focused on health issues.
This is a pioneering breakthrough that we hope we can detect and treat and prevent diseases like Alzheimer's and diabetes and give us a chance to end cancer as we know it, because we'll focus exclusively on those items.
And secondly, I'm proposing a historic funding increase of 50 percent up to—of $4 billion to end the opioid crisis, which still ravages the country and has taken so many lives over the last 2 years; resources both to the States and to Tribes for treatment, as well as prevention.
That also includes the single largest funding increase ever for title I schools—for disadvantaged schools—to lift up the millions of children in low-income families. And it will put them in a position where all the data is—we've—I've talked a lot about this—the data shows that it puts a child from a household that is a lower income household in a position, if they start school—not daycare, but school—at 3 and 4 years old, there's overwhelming evidence that they are able to compete all the way through high school and beyond.
And so it doubles the funding as well for VAWA services, including resources to end the rape-kit backlog. We've been working on this for a long, long time, and we still have a backlog on the rape kit. And the point is: A significant number of women who have been raped—and the person has not been found or convicted is because they're sitting in jail. The average rapist rapes about six times.
And so, out there, we're—we want to make sure we go through this backlog and find out, to bring some certitude to—for the woman who is saying: ""No, no, it was true. That's the man. He did it."" And it changes the whole perspective—all the hearings we held on that.
And also there—it makes major investments in the fight against climate change. And there's issues that are personal to millions of Americans in the area of VAWA, because I get that asked, and we get spoken to by everyone from mayors and Governors, local officials of both parties.
So I look forward to working with Congress to advance these and other priorities. I think we're going to be able to get—I'm hoping we will have some bipartisan support across the board. I've already spoken to some of my Republican colleagues about dealing with the infrastructure legislation we have up there, as well as other budget items. So we're going to work on seeing if we can get some bipartisan support across the board here.
But that's what we're about to do now. We're going to talk about our economic priorities, and we'll get the brief from the team here. But thank you all for coming.",NOTE: The President spoke at 2:25 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. Participating in the meeting were Vice President Kamala D.

8-Apr-21,Remarks on Gun Violence Prevention Efforts,"Thank you, Kamala—Madam Vice President. Thank you very much.
You know, we're joined today by the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, who I've asked to prioritize gun violence. It's also good to see the Second Gentleman, who is here. And it's good to see the First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden, who cares deeply about this issue as well.
And I look out there and I see so many Members of Congress who have led in this fight. So many of you who have never given up. So many of you who are in—absolutely determined, as Murphy and others are, to get this done.
We've got a long way to go. It always seems like we always have a long way to go. But I also—today we're taking steps to confront not just the gun crisis, but what is actually a public health crisis. Nothing—nothing—I'm about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment. They're phony arguments suggesting that these are Second Amendment rights at stake from what we're talking about.
But no amendment—no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You can't yell crowd—you can't yell ""fire"" in a crowded movie theater and call it freedom of speech. From the very beginning, you couldn't own any weapon you wanted to own. From the very beginning that the Second Amendment existed, certain people weren't allowed to have weapons. So the idea is just bizarre to suggest that some of the things we're recommending are contrary to the Constitution.
Gun violence in this country is an epidemic. Let me say it again: Gun violence in this country is an epidemic. And it's an international embarrassment.
You know, we saw that again. Last night, as I was coming to the Oval office, I got the word that, in South Carolina, a physician with his wife, two grandchildren, and a person working at his house was gunned down—all five. So many people—so many of the people sitting here today—know that well, unfortunately. You know, they know what it's like when the seconds change your life forever.
I have had the pleasure of getting to meet, in awful circumstances, many of you who have lost your children, your husbands, your wives. You know, they know what it's like to bury a piece of their soul deep in the Earth. We understand that. Mark and Jackie, I want to tell you: It's always good to see you, but not under these circumstances.
I want to say, before I introduce the rest of the folks, is, you know, what—a lot of people have not been through what they've been through—don't understand. It takes a lot of courage to come to an event like this. They're absolutely, absolutely determined to make change. But Mark and Jackie, whose son Daniel was a first grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School are—Daniel loved sports—loves outdoors sports, getting muddy.
I see my friend Fred Guttenberg. His daughter Jaime was a freshman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. She was an accomplished dancer.
I see Brandon Wolf, who—the shooting at the—at the impulse—at the Pulse club—nightclub. He survived, but his two best friends died.
Greg Jackson, who was just walking down the street when he was caught in the crossfire of a gunfight. And of course, I see a close friend of Jill's and mine, Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who is here. Who was speaking with her constituents in front a grocery store in her State when she was shot and a member of her staff was killed.
You know, they're here, and their pain is immense. And you know, what a lot of you—hopefully, many of you don't know is if you've gone through a trauma, no matter how much you work to make sure others don't go through it, every time you show up at an event like this, it brings back when you got that phone call. It brings back the immediacy of what happened at that moment.
So I genuinely mean it: Thank you. Thank you for having the courage: the courage to be here, the courage to continue this fight. Senator Blumenthal understands it. A lot of the folks out here understand it. But it takes real courage, so thank you.
To turn pain into purpose and demand that we take the actions that gives meaning to the word ""enough."" Enough. Enough. Enough. Because what they want you to know, what they want you to do is not just listen.
Every day in this country, 316 people are shot. Every single day. A hundred and six of them die every day. Our flag was still flying at half-staff for the victims of the horrific murder of 8 primarily Asian American people in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass murder in Colorado.
You probably didn't hear it, but between those two incidents, less than 1 week apart, there were more than 850 additional shootings—850—that took the lives of more than 250 people and left 500—500—injured. This is an epidemic, for God's sake. And it has to stop.
So I'm here to talk about two things: First, the steps we're going to take immediately, and, second, the action that needs to be taken going forward to curb the epidemic of gun violence.
I asked the Attorney General and his team to identify for me immediate, concrete actions I could can take now without having to go through the Congress. And today I'm announcing several initial steps my administration is taking to curb this epidemic of gun violence.
Much more need be done, but the first—first, I want to rein in the proliferation of so-called ""ghost guns."" These are guns that are homemade, built from a kit that include directions on how to finish the firearm. You can go buy the kit. They have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can't be traced.
And the buyers aren't required to pass a background check to buy the kit to make the gun. Consequently, anyone from a criminal to a terrorist can buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a weapon.
You know, I want to see these kits treated as firearms under the Gun Control Act, which is going to require that the seller and manufacturers make the key parts with serial numbers and run background checks on the buyers when they walk in to buy that package.
The section action we're—the second action we're going to take—back in 2000—the year 2000, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms released a report on its investigations into firearms trafficking in America. The report was of pivotal value. It was an important tool for policymakers when I was in the Senate and beyond, at all levels, to stop firearms from being illegally diverted into dangerous hands.
Today, with online sales and ghost guns, times and trafficking methods have changed, and we have to adjust. We also have to ask the Justice Department to release a new annual report. This report will better help policymakers address firearms trafficking as it is today, not what it was yesterday. The third change: We want to treat pistols modified with stabilizing braces with the seriousness they deserve. A stabilizing brace—you're going to pistol—essentially, it makes that pistol a hell of a lot more accurate and a minirifle. As a result, it's more lethal, effectively turning into a short-barreled rifle. That's what the alleged shooter in Boulder appears to have done.
I want to be clear that these modifications to firearms that make them more lethal should be subject to the National Firearms Act. The National Firearms Act requires that a potential owner pay a $200 fee and submit their name and other identifying information to the Justice Department, just as they would if they went out and purchased a silencer for a gun.
Fourthly, during my campaign for President, I wanted to make it easier for States to adopt extreme-risk protection order laws. They're also called ""red flag"" laws, which everybody in this lawn knows, but many people listening do not know. These laws allow a police or family member to petition a court in their jurisdiction and say: ""I want you to temporarily remove from the following people any firearm they may possess because they're a danger and a crisis. They're presenting a danger to themselves and to others."" And the court makes a ruling.
To put this in perspective, more than half of all suicides, for example, involve the use of a firearm. But when a gun is not available, an attempt at suicide, the death rate drops precipitously. States that have ""red flag"" laws have seen and—seen a reduction in the number of suicides in their States.
Every single month, by the way, an average of 53 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. It's been a constant struggle to keep it moving. We know ""red flag"" laws can have a significant effect in protecting women from domestic violence. And we know ""red flag"" laws can stop mass shooters before they can act out their violent plans.
I'm proud—""Excuse the point of personal privilege,"" we used to say in the Senate—I'm proud that the red flag law in my home State of Delaware was named after my son, Attorney General Beau Biden—our son; excuse me, Jill—who proposed that legislation back in 2013.
I want to see a national ""red flag"" law and legislation to incentivize States to enact their own ""red flag"" laws. Today I asked the Justice Department to publish a model ""red flag"" legislation so States can start crafting their own laws right now. Just like with background checks, the vast majority of Americans support these extreme-risk protection order laws, and it's time to put these laws on the books and protect even more people. The Attorney General will have more to say about this in a moment.
Additionally, we recognize that cities across the country are experiencing historic spikes in homicides, as the law enforcement can tell you. The violence is hitting Black and Brown communities the hardest. Homicide is the leading cause of death of Black boys and men ages 15 to 34—the leading cause of death.
But there are proven strategies that reduce gun violence in urban communities, and there are programs that have demonstrated they can reduce homicides by up to 60 percent in urban communities. But many of these have been badly underfunded or not funded at all of late.
Gun violence in America—for those of you who think of this from an economic standpoint listening to me—estimated to cost the Nation $280 billion—let me say it again—$280 billion a year. They said, ""How could that be, Joe?"" Hospital bills, physical therapy, trauma counseling, legal fees, prison costs, and the loss of productivity. Not to mention the psychological damage done to the children who live in these cities, watching this happen, knowing someone it happened to. This gun violence in our neighborhood is having a profound impact on our children, even if they're never involved in pulling the trigger or being the victim of—on the other side of a trigger.
For a fraction of the cost of gun violence, we can save lives, create safe and healthy communities, and build economies that work for all of us and save billions of American dollars in the meantime, much of it, as Senator Cicilline knows, is taxpayer money.
Finally, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the key agency enforcing gun laws, hasn't had a permanent Director since 2015. Today I'm proud to nominate David Chipman to serve as the Director of the AFT. David knows the AFT well. He served there for 25 years. And Vice President Harris and I believe he's the right person, at this moment, for this important agency.
And I've said before: My job, the job of any President, is to protect the American people. Whether Congress acts or not, I'm going to use all the resources at my disposal as President to keep the American people safe from gun violence. But there's much more that Congress can do to help that effort. And they can do it right now.
They've offered plenty of thoughts and prayers—Members of Congress—but they've passed not a single new Federal law to reduce gun violence. Enough prayers. Time for some action.
I believe the Senate should immediately pass three House-passed bills to close loopholes that allow gun purchases—purchasers to bypass the background checks. The vast majority of the American people, including gun owners, believe there should be background checks before you purchase a gun. As was noted earlier, hundreds of thousands of people have been denied guns because of the background checks. What more would have happened?
These bills, one, require background checks for anyone purchasing a gun at a gun show or an online sale. Most people don't know: If you walk into a store and you buy a gun, you have a background check. But you go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want, and no background check.
Second thing is to close the Charleston—what's known as the ""Charleston"" loophole. Like people here, I spent time down at that church in Charleston. What happened is, someone was allowed to get the gun used to kill those innocent people at a church service. If the FBI hasn't completed—didn't complete the background check within 3 days. There's a process. If wasn't done in 3 days, according to Charleston loophole, you get to buy the gun. They bought the gun and killed a hell of a lot of innocent people who invited him to pray with them.
And three, reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which would—the so-called—close the ""boyfriend"" and ""stalking"" loopholes to keep guns out of the hands of people found by a court to be an abuser and continuing threat.
I held over a thousand hours of hearings to pass the Violence Against Women Act, and one thing came through. If in fact a stay-away order—an order preventing the abuser from coming in a certain distance of the person he has abused or she has abused—and now the idea that they can own a weapon when they have a court order saying they are an abuser?
These are some of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence and save lives. But all these bills, they had support of both Democrats and Republicans in the House. And universal background checks are supported by the vast majority of the American people and, I might add, the vast majority of responsible gun owners.
So let me be clear: This is not a partisan issue among the American people. This is a view by the American people as an American issue. And I'm willing to work with anyone to get these done. And it's long past time that we act.
Now, I know this has been a hobbyhorse of mine for a long time—got it done once. We should also ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country. For that 10 years we had it done, the number of mass shootings actually went down. Even law enforcement officials have told me, and told other champions of this legislation, they sometimes feel outgunned by assault weapons with large-capacity magazines. There's no reason someone needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds, 100 bullets that can be fired from that weapon. Nobody needs that. Nobody needs that. We got that done when I was a United States Senator. It wasn't easy going up against the gun lobby, but it saved lives.
And we should also eliminate gun manufacturers from the immunity they received from the Congress. You realize—again, the people here because they're so knowledgeable out here in the Rose Garden. But one piece that people don't realize: The only industry in America, a billion-dollar industry that can't be sued—has exempt from being sued are gun manufacturers.
Imagine how different it would be had that same exemption been available to tobacco companies who knew and lied about the danger they were causing: the cancer caused and the like. Imagine where we'd be.
But this is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued. If I get one thing on my list—the Lord came down and said, ""Joe, you get one of these""—give me that one. Because I tell you what, there would be a ""come to the Lord"" moment these folks would have real quickly. But they're not. They're not. They're exempt.
I know that the conversation about guns in this country can be a difficult one. But even here, there's much more common ground than we—anyone would believe. There's much more common ground.
Everything that's being proposed today is totally consistent with the Second Amendment. And there's a wide consensus behind the need to take action. I know that when overwhelming majorities of Americans want to see something change that will affect their lives and it still doesn't change, it can be demoralizing to our fellow citizens. It can feel like our entire political process is broken.
I know it's painful and frustrating that we haven't made the progress that we'd hoped for. But it took 5 years to get Brady bill passed, and it took even more years to work to pass the assault weapons ban. And it saved lives.
No matter how long it takes, we're going to get these passed. We're not going to give up. We have an opportunity to fulfill the first responsibility of Government: to keep our people safe. And in the process, we can show the world and show ourselves that democracy works, that we can come together and get big things done.
When I look around and see such brave survivors sitting out here in the Rose Garden, public servants who devoted their lives to dealing with this, advocates who feel strongly and are pushing every day to make the rational changes, and courageous parents and family members, I know that progress, even in this most difficult of issues, is possible.
So, folks, this is just the start. We've got a lot of work to do. But I know almost every one of you sitting in the garden here; none of you have ever given up. We're not going to give up now.
The idea that we have so many people dying every single day from gun violence in America is a blemish on our character as nation.
Let me say to all of you: God bless you, but most importantly, the memory of all many of you have lost to this senseless gun violence.
And now I'd like to hand it over to the Attorney General for him to speak and make some comments. And I hope I get a chance to see some of you after this is over.

7-Apr-21,Remarks on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon, everyone.
Last week in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, I announced my plan to rebuild what I refer to as the ""backbone of America"" through the American Jobs Plan. It's not a plan that tinkers around the edges; it's a once-in-a-generation investment in America unlike anything we've done since we built the Interstate Highway System and won the Space Race decades ago.
It's the single largest investment in American jobs since World War II, and it's a plan that puts millions of Americans to work to fix what's broken in our country: tens of thousands of miles of roads and highways, thousands of bridges in desperate need of repair. But it also is a blueprint for infrastructure needed for tomorrow—not just yesterday, tomorrow—for American jobs, for American competitiveness.
Last week, I said that once Congress is back from recess, I'd get to work right away because we have no time to lose. So here we are. Democrats and Republicans will have ideas about what they like and what they don't like about our plan. That's a good thing. That's the American way. That's the way democracy works. Debate is welcome. Compromise is inevitable. Changes are certain.
In the next few weeks, the Vice President and I will be meeting with Republicans and Democrats to hear from everyone. And we'll be listening. We'll be open to good ideas and good-faith negotiations. But here's what we won't be open to: We will not be open to doing nothing. Inaction simply is not an option.
Now, since I announced this plan, I've heard from my Republican friends say that it's—many of them say it's too big. They say, ""Why not focus on traditional infrastructure, fix what we've already got—the roads and the highways that exist and the bridges?"" I'm happy to have that debate. But I'm going to tell you my view. We are America. We don't just fix for today, we build for tomorrow.
Two hundred years ago, trains weren't ""traditional"" infrastructure either until America made a choice to lay down tracks across the country. Highways weren't ""traditional"" infrastructure until we allowed ourselves to imagine that roads could connect our Nation across State lines. The idea of infrastructure has always evolved to meet the aspirations of the American people and their needs, and it's evolving again today.
We need to start seeing infrastructures through its effect on the lives of working people in America. What is the foundation today that they need to carve out their place in the middle class to make it: to live, to go to work, to raise their families with dignity, to ensure that good jobs will be there for their kids, no matter who they are or what ZIP Code they live in?
That's what infrastructure means in the 21st century. It still depends on roads and bridges, ports and airports, rail and mass transit, but it also depends on having reliable, high-speed internet in every home. Because today's high-speed internet is infrastructure.
It depends on the electric grid, a grid that won't collapse in a winter storm or be compromised by hackers at home or abroad. It depends on investing in ""Made in America"" goods from every American community, including those that have historically been left out: Black, Latino, Asian American, Native Americans, rural communities. Talk to folks around the country about what really makes up the foundation of a good economy. Ask a teacher or a childcare worker if having clean drinking water—noncontaminated drinking water—in our schools, in our childcare centers is part of that foundation, when we know that the lead in our pipes slows a child's development when they drink that water.
Ask the entrepreneur whose small business was destroyed by the second hundred-year flood in the last 10 years in Iowa or wildfires in the West that burned 5 million acres last year, an area roughly the size of the entire State of New Jersey. More fires than ever. Or the devastating damage—seeing more frequent and more intense hurricanes and storms on the East and Gulf Coasts.
Ask all those farmers and small-business owners and homeowners whether investing in clean energy to fight the effects of climate change is part of infrastructure.
Ask folks in rural America, where more than 35 percent of the people lack a reliable, high-speed internet, limiting their ability to conduct business or engage in remote learning for their schools. Ask them whether investing in internet access will lead to better jobs in town, new markets for farmers, and better opportunities for their kids.
And I'm serious about this. Ask the moms and dads in the ""sandwich generation""—the folks carrying enormous personal and financial strains trying to raise their children and care for their parents—their elderly parents—or members of their families with a disability. Ask them what sort of infrastructure they need to build a little better life, to be able to breathe a little bit.
It's expanded services for seniors. It's homecare workers, who go in and cook their meal, help them get around and live independently in their home, allowing them to stay in their homes, and I might add, saving Medicaid hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. It's better wages and benefits and opportunities for caregivers, who are disproportionately women, women of color, and immigrants.
Or ask our wounded warriors and military families. To my Republican colleagues in Congress, shouldn't we modernize VA hospitals, update them? Many of them are more than 50 years old. How about the estimated 450,000 post-9/11 veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder, who, when they make that emergency call—or their husband, wife, son, daughter makes that call to the VA hospital—""Dad needs help, we have to bring him in."" And they hear: ""You have to wait. We don't have room now. Come back. Call me back in 8 days, 10 days, 12 days.""
Look at the—more suicides in the military than people getting shot. Is it really your position, my friends, that our veterans don't deserve the most modern facilities? We could catch that cancer diagnosis quicker, with access to better roads, cleaner water, high-speed internet that delivers information faster and more of it.
Above all, infrastructure is about meeting the needs of a nation and putting Americans to work and being able to do and get paid for doing—having good jobs. Plumbers and pipefitters replacing those, literally, thousands of miles of dangerous lead pipes. They're still out there.
Everybody remembers what happened in Flint. There's hundreds of Flints all across America. How many of you know, when you send your child to school, the fountain they're drinking out of is not fed by a lead pipe? How many of you know the school your child is in still has asbestos in the walls and lacks the ventilation? Is that not infrastructure?
Line workers and electricians laying transmission lines for a modern grid, providing over 500,000 charging stations on the highways we are going to build to accommodate electric vehicles so we can own the future.
Construction workers and engineers building modern hospitals and homes for American families. Health care workers, steelworkers, folks who work in the cutting-edge labs. Nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created by our American Jobs Plan can be filled by people who don't have a college degree. Seventy-five percent don't need an associate's degree.
Now, as I said last week, this is a blue-collar blueprint for increasing opportunity for the American people. It also includes the biggest investment in nondefense research and development on record.
I promise you—this is not part of my speech—but I promise you, you're all going to be reporting over the next 6 to 8 months how China and the rest of the world is racing ahead of us in the investments they have in the future, attempting to own the future. The technology, quantum computing, investing significant amounts of money in dealing with cancer and Alzheimer's—that's the infrastructure of a nation.
There's a new book out about how we've fallen behind. America is no longer the leader of the world because we're not investing. It used to be we invested almost 2.7 percent of our GDP in infrastructure. Now it's about 0.7 percent. When we were investing in it, we were the leader in the world.
I don't know why we don't get this. One of the only—a few major economies in the world whose public investment in research and development has declined as a percentage of GDP in the last 25 years—declined: the United States of America—that led the world.
Why does this matter? Investing in research and development help lead to lithium batteries, LED technology, the internet itself. It helped lead to vaccine breakthroughs that are helping us beat COVID-19; to the Human Genome Project, which has led to breakthroughs in how we understand and fight cancer and other diseases.
Government—meaning, the taxpayers—funded this research. Government. When we stop investing in research, we stop investing in the jobs of the future, and we give up leading the world. And when we do invest in research, what we're really doing is raising the bar on what we can imagine.
Imagine a world where you and your family can travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas, or in a high-speed train, close to as fast as you can go across the country in a plane. Imagine your children growing up to work in innovation, good-paying jobs in fields that haven't even been invented yet, like the parents of every computer programmer, every graphic designer, every renewable energy worker once did—imagined.
We invest today so that these jobs will be here in America tomorrow, so America can lead the world that is—as it's historically done. That's why I brought back scientists into the White House. We need to think.
Look, do we think the rest of world is waiting around? ""We're not going to make those kinds of investments,"" the rest of the world is saying. Take a look. Do you think China is waiting around to invest in its digital infrastructure or in research and development? I promise you, they are not waiting, but they're counting on American democracy to be too slow, too limited, and too divided to keep pace.
You've heard me say it before: I think this generation is going to be marked by the competition between democracies and autocracies, because the world is changing so rapidly. The autocrats are betting on democracy not being able to generate the kind of unity needed to make decisions to get in that race. We can't afford to prove them right. We have to show the world—and much more importantly, we have to show ourselves—that democracy works; that we can come together on the big things. This is the United States of America for God's sake.
Of course, building the infrastructure of tomorrow requires major investments today. As I said last week, I'm open to ideas about how to pay for this plan, with one exception: I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year. If others have ideas out there on how to pay for this investment without violating that rule, they should come forward.
There's all kinds of opportunities. Just list all the tax breaks that I find difficult to explain: wealthy deductions, $360 billion if you cap them; top rate of 39 percent, which it used to be for a hundred—for years, all the way to the Bush administration; almost a quarter of a trillion dollars, corporate minimum tax; and the fossil fuel giveaways at $40 billion, et cetera. I could go on.
But let me tell you what I proposed, how to do it. We're going to raise the corporate tax rate. It was 35 percent for the longest time, which was too high. Barack and I thought it was too high during our administration. We all agreed 5 years ago that it should come down somewhat, but the previous administration reduced it all the way down to 21 percent.
What I'm proposing is that we meet in the middle: 28 percent. Twenty-eight percent—we'll still have lower corporate rates than any time between World War II and 2017. It will generate over a trillion dollars in taxes over 15 years.
A new, independent study put out last week found that at least 55 of our largest corporations lose the very—use the various loopholes to pay zero Federal tax—income tax—in 2020. It's just not fair. It's not fair to the rest of the American taxpayers.
We're going to try to put an end to this. Not fleece them—28 percent. If you're a mom, a dad, a cop, firefighter, police officer, et cetera, you're paying close to that in your income tax.
I've also proposed a global minimum tax, which is being proposed around the world for U.S. corporations, of 21 percent. Let me tell you that means. It means that companies aren't going to be able to hide their income in places like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, in tax havens. We're going to also eliminate deductions used by corporations for offshoring jobs and shifting assets overseas. They offshore the jobs, shift the assets overseas, and then don't have to pay taxes on all they make there.
And we'll significantly ramp up IRS enforcement against corporations and the super wealthy who either failed to report their income or underreport it. It's estimated that would raise tens of billions of dollars. It adds up to more than what I proposed in just 15 years. It's honest. It's fair. It's fiscally responsible. And it pays for what we need and reduces the debt over the long haul.
And by the way, I didn't hear any of our friends, who are criticizing this plan, say that the corporate tax cut, which added $2 trillion to the debt—the Trump tax cut, $2 trillion, $1.9 trillion in debt—wasn't paid for, the vast majority of which went to the top 1 percent of the wage earners. I didn't hear anybody hollering in this recovery—the so-called—before I became President—this ""K-shaped"" recovery, where billionaires made $300 billion more dollars during this period. Where's the outrage there? I'm not trying to punish anybody. But damn it, maybe it's because I come from a middle class neighborhood, I'm sick and tired of ordinary people being fleeced.
Let me close by saying this: Whatever partisan divisions there are around other issues, there don't have to be around this one. The divisions of the moment shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing for the future. These aren't Republican bridges, Democratic airports, Republican hospitals, or a Democratic power grid. Think of the transcontinental railroad, Interstate Highway System, or the space race. We're one Nation, united and connected.
As I said last week, I'm going to bring Republicans to the White House. I invite them to come. We'll have good-faith negotiations. And any Republican who wants to get this done, I invite. I invite them. We have to get this—things done. We're at an inflection point in American democracy. This is a moment where we prove whether or not democracy can deliver. Whether it can lay the foundation for an economy built from the bottom up and the middle out, not trickle-down economics from the very top. Whether it can lay a good foundation for good jobs in a 21st-century economy.
I tell the kids—the young people who work for me and told my kids—when I go on college campuses, they're going to see more change in the next 10 years than we've seen in the last 50 years. We're going to talk about commercial aircraft flying at subsonic speeds—supersonic speeds. Be able to, figuratively, if you may—if we decided to do it, traverse the world in about an hour, travel 21,000 miles an hour. So much is changing. We have got to lead it.
I believe democracy can come through when the American people come together. We saw it in the American Rescue Plan. We're seeing it with the Jobs Plan. And the American Rescue Plan, which got so badly criticized—how many of my Republican colleagues have you seen gone on your stations or your newspapers and say, ""Boy, people in my State really like it""? Because it would be improper having asked permission. The number of Republicans and Democrats who were hesitant and have called me saying, ""God, this really works.""
Overwhelming majority of the American people—Democrats, Republics, and Independents—support infrastructure investments that meets the moment. So I urge the Congress: Listen to your constituents, and together, we can lay a foundation for an economy that works for everyone and allows America to remain the world leader. When we do that, I believe, as I said last week, that in 50 years from now, when people look back, they'll say this was the moment, together, that we won America's future. I really believe that.
Thank you all. May God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Corporate Tax Rates 
Q. Mr. President, are you willing to go lower than the 28-percent corporate tax rate?
The President. I'm willing to listen to that. I'm willing to—I'm wide open to, but we've got to pay for this. We've got to pay. There's many other ways we can do it, but I'm willing to negotiate that.
I've come forward with the best, most rational way—in my view, the fairest way—to pay for it. But there are many other ways as well, and I'm open.
Bipartisanship/American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 
Q. Will you have failed on your promise of bipartisanship if you don't get Republicans on board with this plan? Your first plan passed along party lines.
The President. Look, what I said was, I would try to work with my friends on the other side. There are things we're working on together, some of which we've passed and some we will pass.
But the last plan I laid out what was available, what I was suggesting, and how I'd deal with it. And a bipartisan group came to see me. And then, a Republican group came to see me. And they started off at $600 billion, and that was it.
If they come forward with a plan that did the bulk of it and it was a billion-three or -four, -two or -three, that allowed me to have pieces of all that was in there, I would have been—I would've been prepared to compromise, but they didn't. They didn't move an inch. Not an inch.
But, for example, I am dealing with a bipartisan group that came to see me. Now it's about—what?—3, 4 weeks ago when they came about computer chips and about—and they said: ""Look, we have to have our own supply. We have to work together."" We're working on that.Chuck Schumer and, I think, McConnell are about to introduce a bill along those lines. So I'm prepared to work. I really am. But to automatically say that the only thing that's infrastructure is a highway, a bridge, or whatever, that's just not rational. It really isn't. I think the vast majority of Americans think everything from the sewer pipes to the sewer facilities, to the water pipes—I think they're infrastructure.
Anyway. Thank you all so very much.

6-Apr-21,Remarks on COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon, everyone.
I just visited a vaccination clinic in Virginia, at the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia. The seminary and other houses of worship in the area are partnering with the community health centers to offer vaccination and vaccination sites. They're seeing these kinds of partnerships where—and not just there, but we're seeing them all over the country.
People are coming together across the different faiths to serve those most in need, with a special focus on vaccinating seniors from all races, backgrounds, and walks of life. It's an example of America at its finest. And they're all meeting what Pope Francis calls the ""moral obligation"": Get vaccinated—something which can, he went on to say, can save your life and the lives of others.
And I was at the seminary clinic to mark an important milestone as well. Yesterday we crossed 150 million shots in 75 days—the first 75 days my administration—on our way to hitting our goal of 200 million shots by the 100th day in office. That, of course, is the new goal I set after passing the original mark of 100 million shots in my first 100 days, doing it in just 58 days.
At the time, some said 100 million shots was ""too ambitious,"" and then they said, ""It wasn't ambitious enough."" Well, we've got to keep moving. If we could raise it up higher, I'd do that as well. But we know what we have to do: We have to ramp up a whole-of-Government approach that rallies the whole country and puts us on a war footing to truly beat this virus.
And that's what we've been doing: getting enough vaccine supply, mobilizing more vaccinators, creating more places to get vaccinated. And we're now administering an average of 3 million shots per day, over 20 million shots a week. On Saturday alone, we reported, more than 4 million shots were administered. We're the first country to administer 150 million shots and the first country to fully vaccinate over 62 million people.
But here's the deal: I promised an update to the American people every 50 millionth shot, and I'm already back to update you a little over 2 weeks, 2½ weeks later. I promised in the beginning that I'd always give you the straight scoop, straight from the shoulder, the good and the bad.
Well, here's the truth: The good news is, we're on track to beat our goal of 200 million shots in the first 100 days. More than 75 percent of the people over the age of 65 have gotten shots, up from 8 percent when we took office. That's a dramatic turnaround and critical, because seniors account for 80 percent of all COVID deaths.
To help support my goal of safely reopening a majority of K-through-8 schools by my 100th day in office, I directed States in early March to make educators and children—childcare workers eligible for vaccines and to get [set]* a goal of getting all who wanted the vaccination to be able to have one and to do it in the month of March.
I'm pleased to report, according to CDC estimates, over 80 percent of teachers, school staff and childcare workers received at least one shot by the end of March. And that's great progress protecting our educators, our essential workers. And because our vaccine program is in overdrive, we're making it easier to get a vaccination shot. Last week, I announced that by April 19 of this month, 90 percent of all Americans will be within five miles of a vaccination site.
And further good news is that we're getting more and more data on just how effective the vaccines are. Dr. Fauci recently cited two studies from the New England Journal of Medicine that found fully vaccinated care workers—health care workers on the frontlines had an extremely low infections rate, less than two-tenths of 1 percent, compared to unvaccinated health care workers who had considerably higher infection rates.
So we're making incredible progress. There is a lot of good news, but there is also some bad news. New variants of the virus are spreading, and they're moving quickly. Cases are going back up. Hospitalizations are no longer declining. While deaths are still down—way down from January—they're going up in some places. So you might ask—everybody is asking: What does that mean?
I understand that people may find it confusing that the vaccination program is saving tens of thousands of lives, but the pandemic remains dangerous. Let me explain it in a single word: Time. Time. Even moving at the record speed we're moving at, we're not even halfway through vaccinating over 300 million Americans. This is going to take time. Remember: For a two-dose vaccine, it takes weeks from the time you get your first one until you are able to get your second shot, which makes you fully protected.
If you get your first shot next week, in mid-April, you won't be fully protected until—until May—late May. If you get your first shot in mid-May, you aren't fully protected until late June. So look—now, on the one hand, June isn't that far away given how long this has been going on, but it isn't here yet either. So the virus is spreading because we have too many people who, seeing the end in sight, think we're at the finish line already.
But let me be deadly earnest with you: We aren't at the finish line. We still have a lot of work to do. We're still in a life-and-death race against this virus. Until we get more people vaccinated, we need everyone to wash their hands, socially distance, and mask up in a recommended mask from the CDC.
Think about it this way: Better times are ahead. And as I've said before, we can have a safe, happy Fourth of July with your family and friends, in small groups in your backyard. The real question is: How much death, disease, and misery are we going to see between now and then?
In January—just the month of January—we lost 95,747—excuse me, 95,774 Americans. In March, that was 37,172 Americans. All told—as you're all about to know—I keep doing this, I know, but I carry this card, every day, with my schedule on it. And on the back, I have a COVID update. The total number of deaths in the United States to date is 554,064 dead. That's lives that have been lost.
What we do now is going to determine how many people we'll save or lose in the month of April and May and June before we get to July 4. So, please, until we're further along in this accelerating, successful, but still growing vaccination effort, please wash your hands. Practice social distancing. Wear a mask, as recommended by the CDC. Get vaccinated when it's your turn.
While I'm asking Americans—the American people to do their job, here's what I'm doing. When we first started our vaccination program, the real question is how quickly we could get shots in people's arms. Well, by the end of May, the vast majority of adult Americans will have gotten at least their first shot. That success—that success—is going to save lives and get this country back to normal sooner. But it's not enough. On March the 11th, I announced that I was opening up all vaccination sites to all adults by May 1. Many Governors—Democrats and Republicans—responded and decided to beat that date, which was good. Thanks to their hard work and the hard work of the American people, and the hard work of my team, I'm announcing today that we're moving that date up from May 1 to April 19, nationwide. That means, by no later than April 19, in every part of this country, every adult over the age of 18—18 or older will be eligible to be vaccinated. No more confusing rules. No more confusing restrictions.
My message today is a simple one. Many States have already opened up to all adults. But beginning April 19, every adult in every State, every adult in this country is eligible to get in line to get a COVID vaccination.
And today, in advance of that new national full-eligibility date, I want to make a direct appeal to our seniors and everyone who cares about them. While we have made incredible progress vaccinating three-quarters of our seniors and putting vaccination sites within 5 miles of 90 percent of the public, it still isn't enough. It's simple: Seniors, it's time for you to get vaccinated now. Get vaccinated now.
To make it easier, my administration is sending aid to community groups to drive seniors to vaccination sites. We're incredibly grateful to all the volunteers, houses of worship, and the civic groups that are helping us in this effort. This is America. We take care of one another. And we have to keep it up.
As I ask seniors to sign up for their shots now, I also have a message for people under 65. If you know someone over 65 who has not gotten this lifesaving vaccine, call them now. Work with them to get their shots this week or next. Pick them up, drive them. It can be your parents, your grandparents, your aunt, uncle, your neighbors.
And finally, even after we open up vaccinations to all adults and put a site within 5 miles of 90 percent of the public, we know there are many people who still struggle to get access to a shot. We know that there are a number of seniors and people with disabilities and people in many communities of color who may be isolated and lack access to transportation.
That's why we're ramping up transportation to vaccination centers and deploying more mobile units and pop-up clinics in the places close to where people live. That's why we're working with faith-based organizations and other community groups to host vaccination clinics, sign people up for appointments, get help—help them get those appointments.
That's why we're sending even more vaccines to community health centers, like the one I was in today, that all together serve nearly 30 million Americans, like the ones I visited today. Two-thirds of the patients at community health centers live at or below the poverty level. Sixty percent are racial and ethnic minorities. To reach them, we're investing nearly $10 billion to expand testing, treatment, and vaccinations for the hardest hit yet most underserved communities.
Let me close with this: We've vaccinated more people than any other nation on Earth. The vaccines have proven to be safe and effective. That should give us real hope, but it can't let it—we can't let it make us complacent.
Despite the progress we're making as a nation, I want every American to know in no uncertain terms that this fight isn't over. This progress we've worked so hard to achieve can be reversed. Now is not the time to let down. Now is not the time to celebrate. It's time to do what we do best as a country: do our duty, our jobs, taking care of one another. And we can and will do this, but we can't let up now.
My hope is, before the summer is over, I'm talking to you all about how we have even access to more vaccines than we need to take care of every American, and we're helping other poor countries, countries around the world that don't have the money, the time, the expertise. Because until this vaccine is available to the world and we're beating back the vaccine—the virus in other countries, we're not really completely safe.
So we've made great progress. I'm still looking forward to the prospect if we keep the pace we're on and we listen to one another and take the precautions I talked about, that you'll be able to have a Fourth of July, an Independence Day on July the 4th, as I defined about 3 weeks ago. I want to have an Independence Day, an independence from the COVID, so you're able to get in the backyard with a small group of people, of friends and neighbors, and celebrate Independence Day because you've been vaccinated, because you're safe, because you're in the clear.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much for listening. Thank you.
Iran Nuclear Negotiations in Vienna, Austria 
Q. Mr. President—how are the talks going, Mr. President? In Vienna, how are the Vienna talks going?
The President. I'll report on that later.
2021 Master's Golf Tournament in Augusta, Georgia/Georgia Election Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, do you think the Masters golf tournament should be moved out of Georgia?
The President. I think that's up to the Masters. Look, you know, it is reassuring to see that for-profit operations and businesses are speaking up about how these new Jim Crow laws are just antithetical to who we are.
There's another side to it too. The other side to it too is, when they, in fact, move out of Georgia, the people who need the help the most—people who are making hourly wages—sometimes get hurt the most.
I think it's a very tough decision for a corporation to make or a group to make, but I respect them when they make that judgment, and I support whatever judgment they make. But it's—the best way to deal with this is for Georgia and other States to smarten up. Stop it. Stop it. It's about getting people to vote.
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President——
Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts/Vaccine Hesitancy 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Despite your personal appeal now, there are many Americans who are very reluctant to take the vaccine, especially in red States. Why the White House hasn't used a more forceful campaign, like advertisement on television, for example, to convince Americans to take that vaccine so we can reach the herd immunity?
The President. We are. We are doing that. And by the way, the number of people who are reluctant to take it continues to diminish. It continues to diminish across the country as they see their neighbors, particularly in communities that have been very—now, there's a different group of people. There's a group of people who've been reluctant because of past—how can I say it?—past wrongs that had been done to them, experimentation, not sure that they're being told the truth, et cetera.
But then, there's another group that seems, to me, to be—I probably shouldn't characterize it, but Mitch McConnell keeps speaking to them, which I give him credit for, saying, ""The idea""—he said the polling data shows Republican men, particularly young men, don't think they should have to take the vaccine; it's their patriotic right not to do it, their freedom to choose. And he's saying: ""No, no, take the vaccine. Take the vaccine."" And I'll add a phrase he didn't, but I think he believes: It's a patriotic responsibility you have.
Last question.
Q. Mr. President——
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell 
Q. Mr. President, have you spoken to the Federal Reserve Chairman, Jay Powell, yet?
The President. I have not.
Q. Can you say why? Do you plan to speak to him soon, sir?
The President. I am not—look, I think the Federal Reserve is an independent operation. And starting off my Presidency, I want to be real clear that I'm not going to do the kinds of things that had been done in the last administration, either talking to the Attorney General about who he's going to prosecute or not prosecute and under what circumstances or the Fed, telling them what they should and shouldn't do, even though that wouldn't be the basis upon which I'd be talking to him.
So I've been very fastidious about not talking to them, but I do talk to the Secretary of Treasury.
Thank you all very much.
Coronavirus Pandemic 
Q. And one more on COVID, Mr. President. You mentioned 554,064 American dead from COVID-19. A lot of families want to know how this happened, how it got here. Have you had a chance to speak to any of your international partners, any of—President Xi, who I know you go way back with? Have you had the chance to ask him if these reports are true, that China maybe misled the world at the beginning?
The President. No, I have not had that conversation with President Xi. Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 4:10 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the White House.

Federal Coronavirus Response/Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, quickly: Do you think the worst is behind us with COVID-19?
The President. I think if everyone continues down the road we're on now, it will be behind us. But it's not over yet. We're in a situation where we—I believe, by the end of this summer, we'll have a significant portion of the American public vaccinated.
I'm going to be making a speech when I leave here. There's no place to do it here, but back at the White House, we're going to announce how far down the road we are in terms of the number of people vaccinated with at least one shot.
I think before another 25 days, we'll probably have somewhere in excess of 200 million shots that have been administered. And the good news is: A clear, overwhelming majority of people over the age of 65 have gotten at least one shot. And that's the most susceptible age bracket.
And the good thing also: All these strains you're hearing about, you should not worry. They are more virulent, and they are—some are more dangerous, but the vaccines work on all of them. So the idea is, don't think that means you shouldn't get a vaccine. That increases the need to get one quickly, because that's how we're going to beat this. And you're going to beat it.
But keep wearing a mask.
Participant. Yes.
The President. Social—wash the hands and socially distance, which I'm not doing. [Laughter] I'm going to get in trouble here. Is this your second shot?
Participant. Second shot.

And I'm thankful to our friends at the White House Historical Association and the National Park Service for helping us deliver thousands of commemorative eggs to vaccination sites in communities and health care centers all across America.
Easter is a day of joy, when we celebrate resurrection and renewal. But this year, we know many are still going without the familiar comforts of the season.
The virus is not gone, and the second year in a row, most will be apart from their families or friends and a full congregation to fill us with so much joy. But the Scripture tells us, ""Joy cometh in the morning.""
As we celebrate the renewal of this season, we know that longed-for dawn is almost here. We will rebuild our Nation. We will reengage and reimagine what we can be. We'll remember that with faith, hope, and love, anything is possible. And we look forward to next year when the White House will ring with joy of the season once again and there'll be an Easter Egg Roll, God willing.

The President. Let me say something. We'll be talking about—a lot about infrastructure today. And it's kind of interesting that when the Republicans put forward an infrastructure plan, they thought everything from broadband to dealing with other things would—trains were infrastructure. Now they're saying that there's—only a small portion of what I'm talking about is infrastructure.
The fact of the matter is that when you're in a situation where you can't turn on the water fountain in school and worry you're going to drink polluted water that affects your health, replacing all those pipes is infrastructure. When I'm talking about making sure that you take that asbestos out of schools, that's infrastructure. When I'm talking about building high-speed rail, that's infrastructure. When I'm talking about making sure you're in a situation where we can redo some of the Federal buildings that are just absolutely leaking energy every single day, that's infrastructure. And it gets to the roads and bridges and highways and broadband.
So I—it's interesting how their definition of infrastructure has changed. But they know it's—they know we need it.
Corporate Tax Rates 
Q. Are you worried that a higher tax will drive corporations to——
The President. Not at all.
Q. ——other countries, though?
The President. Not at all. Look, the tax——
Q. Why not?
The President. Because there's no evidence of that. The tax was 36 percent. It's now down to 21 percent. And the idea that—that's bizarre. We were talking about a 28-percent tax that everybody thought was just fair enough for everybody. The idea—you have—here you have 51 or 52 corporations of the Fortune 500 haven't paid a single penny in taxes for 3 years. Come on, man. Let's get real.
So I'll have a lots to talk about.
The President's Infrastructure Proposal 
Q. Other than how to pay for the plan, where is the room for negotiation with Republicans? What parts of your plan are you willing to do away with, given the definition of infrastructure here is so different?
The President. Well, I'm not going to negotiate with you on that. [Laughter]
Q. Well, no, but what would you——
The President. No, but I mean, why would I say that?
Q. What would you tell the American people about where you——
The President. Well, I'd tell the American people——
Q. ——you're willing to compromise?
The President. ——I'm going to push as hard as I can to change the circumstances so we can compete with the rest of the world—compete with the rest of the world. Everybody around the world is investing billions and billions of dollars in infrastructure, and we're going to do it here.
Thank you.
Q. And, Mr. President, are you concerned about a fourth wave of the coronavirus? Are you concerned about a fourth surge, Mr. President?",NOTE: The President spoke at 11:43 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White House.,"Joseph R. Biden, Remarks and an Exchange With Reporters Upon Arrival From Camp David, Maryland Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/349424 ",,,,,,,,,,,
2-Apr-21,Remarks on the National Economy and the Federal Coronavirus Response and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Before I start, I hope you all have a good weekend.
Q. Thank you!
Q. You too.
The President. I'm looking forward to it. [Laughter] I'm looking forward to it.
Well, good morning. This morning we've learned that our economy created 900,000 jobs in March. It means the first 2 months of our administration has seen more new jobs created than the first 2 months in any administration in history. But we still have a long way to go to get our economy back on track after the worst economic and job crisis in nearly a century.
But my message to the American people is this: Help is here. Opportunity is coming. And at long last, there's hope for so many families—so many families. Credit for this progress belongs not to me, but to the American people: hard-working women and men who have struggled through this pandemic, never given up, and are determined to get the country back on track, as well as their families.
But I think it's also a reflection of two things we're doing here. First, the new economic strategy we've launched: one focused on building from the bottom up and the middle out, and one that puts government on the side of working people—and that rewards work, not wealth.
When we invest in the American people, it's not just those at the top that make our economy grow. They're the ones that make it grow: ordinary Americans. We saw the economy gain traction in March as the American Rescue Plan moved and got passed, bringing new hope to our country. And we're going to continue to implement that law in the weeks ahead.
By April 7—next week—over 130 million households will have gotten their $1,400 per-person rescue check. Funds are on their way to local communities to put educators, health care workers, home health care aides, police, firefighters, sanitary workers back on the job. They're getting more aid for small businesses, and we're also going to hang an ""open"" sign again on the door to rehire folks that had to be let go.
And, in the months ahead, a new childcare tax credit will cut taxes and provide help to millions of families with young children. There is nothing—nothing—I know you're tired of hearing me say this, but I mean it: There's nothing the American people cannot do if we give them a chance. And the American Rescue Plan does precisely that for hard-working, middle class folks at long last.
Secondly, today's report also reflects the progress we've made on my other key priority: getting the American people vaccinated. We've turned around a slow-moving vaccination program into being the envy of the world. Yesterday we set an alltime record for Thursday vaccinations, ending a 7-day period—that was the first ever—where we administered 20 million shots in 70 days—in 7 days. That's 20 million shots in a week. No other country has come close to doing that.
So we've made significant progress on that front, but the fight is far from over. We know that vaccines are safe and effective. We're vaccinating more people than any other country on Earth. We also have progress on jobs and progress on vaccinations. But in the face of this great news, I need also to make this clear and direct statement to the American people: The progress that we have worked so hard to achieve can be reversed.
On the economic front, the benefits and the impacts of the American Rescue Plan are temporary by design. It was a—it is a rescue plan. But as we get the economy back on its feet, we need to do the hard work of building back better for good, for—not just for a while, but for good; not just the short term, but for good.
That's why I proposed the American Jobs Plan on Wednesday in Pittsburgh. It's an 8-year program that invites—and let me put it another way. I've heard from everybody all across the country about the need for infrastructure. How many times have we heard, ""This is infrastructure week"" over the last 4 years? About every second week was infrastructure week, but no infrastructure was built.
Well, this is an 8-year program that invests in our roads, our bridges, broadband, airports, ports, and fixing our water systems. It's going to repair our VA hospitals across the country. Many of them are more than 50 years old and are in real need of help. It will invest in research and development to outcompete China and the rest of the world.
Independent analysis shows that if we pass this plan, the economy will create 19 million jobs: good jobs, blue-collar jobs, jobs that pay well. That's long-term jobs for pipefitters, health care workers, those who work in the steel factories and the cutting-edge labs as well.
The new report out this week shows that nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan can be filled by people who don't have a college degree. Seventy-five percent of those good-paying jobs don't need a associate's degree. It's a blue-collar blueprint for increasing the opportunity for people.
This an economic opportunity for those who've helped build the country and have been ignored or neglected for much too long by our Government. It's a once-in-a-generation investment in our economic future—a chance to win the future—paid for by asking big corporations, many of which do not pay any taxes at all, just to begin to pay their fair share. And it won't raise a penny tax on a family making less than $400,000 a year—no Federal tax, no addition.
When Congress comes back after this Easter break, I'm going to begin meeting with Democrats, Republicans about this plan. I've spoken to Republicans on the phone. I'm going to be looking forward to meeting with them.
They all have their ideas about what it will take, what they like, and what they don't like. That's a good thing. That's the American way. Debate is welcome. Compromise is inevitable. Changes in my plan are certain. But inaction is not an option.
The American people have been promised action on infrastructure for decades. They've been promised that after our leaders would take our country and make it more competitive for decades.
I've made my plan to address this long-overdue need. And it's clear: Polls already shows strong support for infrastructure investment for the American people, whether they're Democrats, Republicans, or Independents. Congress should debate my plan, change it, and offer alternatives if they think that's what they have to do. But Congress should act.
Likewise, on the virus, our program there, too, can be undone. As fast as we're moving, more adults remain to be vaccinated in April, May, and June than have already been vaccinated in February and March. We are not even halfway done yet.
Too many Americans are acting as if this fight is over. It is not. I've told people that if my administration did the hard work of getting shots to all Americans in the next few months and if the American people continued to do their part—mask up, practice social distancing—we could have a more normal July the 4th.
But this is still April, not July. We aren't there yet. And so, cases are going up again. The virus is spreading more rapidly in many places. Deaths are going up in some States. So I ask, I plead with you: Don't give back the progress we've all so—fought so hard to achieve.
We need to finish this job. We need every American to buckle down and keep their guard up in this homestretch. Wear your mask. Keep safe distance from one another. Wash your hands. Get vaccinated when it's your turn. That's how we're going to beat the virus, cast off the weight of the pandemic that's holding our economy back.
While the earliest signs from this job report that's announcing today are promising and the American Rescue Plan is starting to make a real difference, today's report also reminds us how deep a hole we started in. After a year of devastation, there are still 8.4 million fewer jobs today than there were last March—8.4 million. We created 900,000 again. But 8.4 million jobs fewer today than last March.
So, too many Americans who have been unemployed for longer than 6 months. Too many women have been forced out of the workforce. Unemployment among people of color remains far too high. Yes, we've made progress by starting to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. And yes, the American Rescue Plan is laying the foundation for that economy. But we still need the American Jobs Plan to build on that foundation to build this country back better.
So the bottom line is this: Today's report is good news. Today's report shows that the country can—what it can do when we act together to fight a virus, to give working people the help they need. But we still have a long way to go, but I know that we are going to get there and we're going to get there together.
May God bless you all. And may you have a happy Easter and a holy Easter. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President——
Employment Rate/National Economy 
Q. How much credit are you taking for today's numbers?
The President. I'm giving credit to the American people.
Q. [Inaudible]—five percent——
Corporate Tax Rate 
Q. Is there a risk, sir, if raising taxes could slow the economy?
The President. Raising taxes, the studies show, will not slow the economy at all. Asking corporate America just to pay their fair share will not slow the economy at all. It will make the economy function better and will create more energy.
The President's Infrastructure Proposal 
Q. Mr. President, Mitch McConnell says he's going to fight your administration every step of the way. What is your reaction to that?
The President. [Laughter] If the Republicans argue that we don't need infrastructure, it need not—they've been talking about the need for it for years now. If the Republicans decide that we need it, but they're not going to pay for it, it's just going to increase the deficit; if the Republicans say the next phase of my plan—we don't need to invest in VA hospitals and keep the sacred obligation we've made to so many Americans; if the Republicans say that the 400,000 homes and our schools and daycare centers that have lead pipes—lead pipes—delivering water to their doors—if they say we shouldn't be doing that, what do you think would happen if they found out all the lead pipes were up in the Capitol every time they turned on a water fountain?
So I think—look, I think we're going to have—I think the Republicans' voters are going to have a lot to say about whether we get a lot of this done.

1-Apr-21,Remarks Prior to a Cabinet Meeting,"Well, again, thank you all for coming together to form this historic Cabinet. This is the first in American history that the Cabinet looks like America. That's what we promised we were going to do, and it's—and we've done it.
I'm grateful that the Senate acted in a bipartisan way, at a modern record speed, to get the Cabinet confirmed. It's hard to believe, but we are among the quickest formed of all the Cabinet members being put in place.
We have a lot to discuss, but while the press is here, I want to make one announcement. Yesterday, in Pittsburgh, I laid out my vision for rebuilding America with the American Jobs program. And while most of the Cabinet will have a role in helping shape and press the Jobs Plan, today I'm announcing that I'm asking five Cabinet members to take special responsibility to explain the plan to the American public.
Working with my team here in the White House, these Cabinet members will represent me in dealing with Congress, engage the public in selling the plan, and help work out the details as we refine it and move forward. These five members will be Pete Buttigieg, Jennifer Granholm, Marcia Fudge, Marty Walsh, and Gina Raimondo. And I think—I want to thank them in advance for the role they're going to play with this added assignment I'm asking them to take on. And we'll be discussing that today and among other things.
And one of those other things—our administration—is a commitment to ""buy American,"" the plan we're putting forward to make sure that when the Government is spending taxpayers' money, that they're spending it on American-made goods of American corporations and American employees.
Today I'm directing every member of the Cabinet—I mean this sincerely—every one—to take a hard look at their agency's spending and make sure it follows my ""buy American"" standard, which we set out in January. I'm going to ask you all to report back to me at the next Cabinet meeting.
And now we've got a lot of business to do, to get done. And I thank the press for being here, but I'll talk to you all later.
Thank you.",NOTE: The President spoke at 1:29 p.m. in the East Room at the White House.,"Joseph R. Biden, Remarks Prior to a Cabinet Meeting Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/349376 ",,,,,,,,,,,
1-Apr-21,Remarks During a Videoconference on Faith and Community Engagement,"The President. Well, thank you very much. That's a very generous introduction. [Laughter] I hope that's true, but I'm not so sure.
Look, folks, first of all, I want to thank you all for this—the faith community leaders getting together. And I want to thank my buddy, Cedric, for honchoing this for me and—because we both believe that you have profound influence on not only your congregations, but on the public at large. You are the community leaders. And Jill and I want to send our warmest wishes to all of you, your families, your congregations, and your communities on this holiday and holy season.
You know, what I always find remarkable as one of my avocations is—and I think I drive Cedric crazy and some of you crazy—has been theology and comparative religion. And one of the interesting things—think about the confluence of the—this season marks remarkable confluence of holy days across a number of traditions.
Jill and I, we're looking forward to our Easter celebration, where we get to get together with our family. And because we've had the great honor of being vaccinated, we may be able to get together with some of them this Easter. And—but Passover began last week. The Hindu holiday of Holi was last week. Ramadan is right around the corner.
And you know it's not only a time of reverence and celebration, it's one of the most important opportunities of the year to connect with your congregations and with your communities. And all of the great confessional faiths have the same notion about the value of human beings and the value in that we're made in the image of God, and that's why all of you gotten involved in the way you have. And no one—no one—no one is not important; everyone is important.
And so, you know, everybody is looking to you this season. They—you know, they trust you. It's one of the most important opportunities of the year to connect with your congregations. And I hope that doesn't sound instructive; I don't mean to sound that way. I—you know better than I do. But it's—but to connect with your congregations and those in your community.
And so, you know, I think they're looking to you this season. As I said, they trust you. And you have a chance to deliver not only a spiritual direction, but comfort and guidance; prayers of joy, love, reflection; you know, rebirth that's synonymous with these holidays. Because in the last year, you've been through—we've been through an awful lot of tough, tough times, particularly all of you in the faith community.
How many times did you watch on a cell phone a parishioner having to say goodbye to his mother or father in a ward where they couldn't be there? A nurse holding up that phone. And all—how many times have you lamented the fact that leaders in your faith community have not even been able to have the funerals that they deserve and the remembrance that is so important, because there's a finality? How many of you have not been able to, you know, be at the cemetery site and with the family? I mean—and there's so many things that people look to you for comfort for.
And you know, I said earlier this week, we're in a race against this virus, and the race is far from over. You know, it's—we—it's taken far too many moms and dads; sisters; brothers; you know, grandpops, grandmoms. You know. And they—we put dreams and plans on hold, and it's kept us physically apart, which is not the instinct of human beings. They want to congregate. They want to be with other—and they want to be with one another of like views, like conscience, like values.
And so we all know many families are still going without a familiar comfort to the season. We know that, despite the progress we've made, this fight is far from over.
We also know that signs of hope have emerged. I was—we were looking at a mass vaccination site out in—I think it was in Arizona, and the nurse was talking to us—virtual. And the nurse was saying that—she said—well, I was asking her how many shots had been given, and she said: ""These are shots of hope. These are shots of hope."" Hope springs eternal. You're a source of so much hope.
And more than a—we've now given—I'm very proud to say we've administered over 130 million shots. And 75 percent of all seniors now have received the shots, which is a drastic change and increases exponentially the prospect that they'll live out their lives in the way they anticipated. And you know, 100 million of those shots in fewer than 9 weeks, and more every day.
And families are getting the financial relief they need so they can take a breath. I don't know how many of you have had to carry people who have been—in your communities—because they've been—the food shortages—the failure—people getting thrown out of their apartments or not able to pay their mortgage.
Well, with the legislation I was able to—[inaudible]—with the help of Cedric and so many other people—get passed, it has brought genuine relief, serious, serious relief to people. It's about, you know, ""What you do unto the least of my brethren, you do unto me."" I mean, it's—this is really—it is significant.
And also, you know, we launched a program to—because, you know, this has been an unequal killer. It has focused mainly—you know, the African American community; the Hispanic community; the AAP—the Asian Pacific community. It has—it has damaged them much more than others. They are three to four times more likely to die if they've gotten the COVID. And they're about the same percentage likely to get the COVID over the traditional—the remainder of the white population. And so I've been—we've set up, in our effort to deal with COVID and the COVID team we put together, a scientist who is nothing but racial equity to make sure we can get to the people.
And by the way, I need not tell you all I come from a community that has a very large African American population, and I spent a lot of time in the Black church, because it does more for my community than most anything else. And I—I don't know—you know, I can remember discussions way back—when I was a kid getting started in public life—about how there was a distrust for—for some docs and mass vaccination things.
And even when we were—I—my wife put together an ability to get mammogram vans to go around communities. There's distrust because, you know, there have been experimentation on African Americans in World War II, so many things where the treatment has not been fair and decent.
So I wanted to make—you know, Cedric and I want to make sure that this does not ever happen again. And we've been totally science-based. But you're trusted voices in the community. You know, this is the moment that the people you serve are looking for—for direction, looking for some help.
And we need to get the word out. And the word is that these vaccines are safe, I promise you. I promise you they're safe. That's why I've made sure to get one on television so people can see the President of the United States. Why would I take a vaccine that I thought wasn't safe? And they're safe.
And—but we also made it more available. One of the things we did—and initially caused a little bit of a stir among some Governors—but you know, we made vaccinations available to 17,000 local pharmacies because that's where people were most comfortable—where they can go.
And then, I've scaled that up to now 40,000 local pharmacies and stores you can get these shots. This is going to put vaccination sites within 5 miles of 90 percent of all Americans. We also have hundreds of mobile vehicles going out in rural and African American and Hispanic communities, because a lot of people that are older, they can't get to where they have to go.
And the—and Health and Human Services is making $3 billion in grants available for community groups within States to increase access at our federally run vaccination centers. We partner with faith-based organizations—many of you on the phone, I'm sure—to reverse the vaccine, you know, delay and make sure we can reserve appointments for members.
And we're soon going to be in place where everybody—every American will be able to get the vaccine and should get in line. There should be no restrictions based on age any longer because we're able to get over—over—you know, we've gotten millions and millions of shots—vaccines available.
So look, the point I guess I'm trying to make is: The faith community—as faith community leaders, you've been critical partners with us in our COVID response and our vaccine efforts already, including many of you on this call.
We're enormously grateful for all you've done, including help educate folks about the relief we're delivering through the Rescue Plan; the $1,400; money for childcare; the childcare [child]* tax credit, which is—we're reducing child poverty by 40 percent—are cutting it in half, actually—50 percent. And because of what we've been able to do to provide funding for people who have children—and anyway, it's a long—I don't want—I'm going on too long.
But we need you to spread the word. Let people in our communities, in your communities know how important it is to get everyone vaccinated when it's their turn. And soon, they'll just be able to just line up and just get their name on a list. And that's how we're going to defeat this virus. And that's how we're going to come together again in our communities, in our houses of worship, in my view.
You know, I know people think I'm kidding when I—what I'm worried about now, as the scientists tell me, is that people are getting too cavalier—where, you know, we're traveling a great deal, we're gathering in larger crowds—and people aren't wearing their masks, aren't social distancing, aren't washing their hands. And you see that it's starting to spike in other areas again.
So we're not finished with this. So, you know—and I don't, you know—some people think that's an imposition on people's freedom. I think it's the—a godly thing to do. Protect your brother and sister. That's what this is about. It's about protecting people. It's a patriotic duty I think we have.
But they're going to listen to your words more than they are me as President of the United States. When they're in your sanctuaries, you can talk to them about what we have to do, what's available, and not to be fearful—not to be fearful getting the vaccine. And I've said, I think it's—I guess I should say, and I'll conclude by saying: I think it's more than a patriotic duty; I think it's a moral duty. Put an end to the dark years behind us—a dark year—and do our part to spread the light in the spirit of all holidays of this spring season.
I want to thank you all for what you're doing. I look forward to being able to get back into houses of worship and visit like I have in the past and will hope to do again.
But, in the meantime, God bless you all. Thank you for looking out for your—our brethren. And I think we can get this done. But thank you. Thank you. Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 12:15 p.m. at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to White House Director of Public Engagement Cedric L.

31-Mar-21,"Remarks on the American Jobs Plan in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","Thank you. Gov, Mike asked me—and I say to Bobby, my good friend—he asked me back there—he said, ""Do you ever get nervous?"" And I—he said, ""Because I got up this morning, made breakfast for my kids, said I've got to introduce the President.'""
And what I say to you, Mike: You did a heck of a job. But I'd get nervous if I had to get up in the middle of the night, climb up a telephone pole, replace—in the middle of a storm—a connection that knocked out everybody's electricity and put a transformer in. That's what would make me nervous. So what you did was really good. I couldn't do what you do, pal. [Laughter] I couldn't do what you do.
And I want to—and it's true, Mike. You're a union guy; me too. I got in trouble, but I don't make any apologies for it. I'm a union guy. I support unions. Unions built the middle class. It's about time they start to get a piece of the action.
To all my colleagues—from the county executive, to the mayor, to everyone who's here, I want to say: Thank you. Thank you, Congressman, for the passport into your district. And I appreciate being here. I'm honored to be with you.
Two years ago, I began my campaign here in Pittsburgh, saying I was running to rebuild the backbone of America. And today I return as your President to lay out the vision of how I believe we do that—rebuild the backbone of America.
It's a vision not seen through the eyes of Wall Street or Washington, but through the eyes of hard-working people, like the people I grew up with; people like Mike and his union family; union workers in this Carpenters Training Center; people like the folks I grew up with in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware; people who get up every day, work hard, raise their family, pay their taxes, serve their country, and volunteer for their communities, and just looking for a little bit of breathing room—just a little bit of light.
Ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. The people who break their necks every day for their families and the country they love—a country that, in fact—which, on the day I was elected, was in extreme distress with a virus on a deadly rampage that has now killed four thousand—excuse me, five hundred—I carry it in my pocket every day. I have the list of exactly how many have died: 547,296 Americans dead from the virus—more than all the people killed in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam war, 9/11. 547,296 Americans. And an economy that left millions out of work and created so much anxiety.
That's why I moved so quickly to pass the American Rescue Plan with the help of my friends here in the Congress. I really mean that. It didn't pass by a whole lot, but with the leadership of Conor and Bobby and the mayor, and—just, you got it done, because it was an emergency. We needed to act to save jobs, to save businesses, and to save lives. And that's what we did.
We're beginning to see the results. We're on our way to having given 200 million vaccination shots in the first 100 days of my Presidency. When I said I'd get 100 million done, people thought it was a significant exaggeration. We're going to get 200 million done—twice the original goal—because of all the help of all of you.
Leading economists are now predicting our economy will grow 6 percent this year. That's a rate we haven't seen in years and years. We can cut child poverty in half this year. With the American Rescue Plan, we're meeting immediate emergencies. Now it's time to rebuild. Even before the crisis we're now facing, those at the very top in America were doing very well, which is fine. They were doing great. But everyone else was falling behind. The pandemic only made the division so much worse and more obvious. Millions of Americans lost their jobs last year, while the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans saw their net worth increase by $4 trillion. It just goes to show you how distorted and unfair our economy has become. It wasn't always this way.
Well, it's time to change that. I'd note, parenthetically, that I got criticized for giving tax breaks to middle class and poor folks this last time. I didn't hear that cry—hue and cry when we were doing the same thing when Trump's tax bill passed and 83 percent of the money went to the top 1 percent.
You know, this is not to target those who've made it, not to seek retribution. This is about opening opportunities for everybody else. And here's the truth: We all will do better when we all do well. It's time to build our economy from the bottom up and from the middle out, not the top down. That hasn't worked very well. For the economy overall, it hasn't worked, because Wall Street didn't build this country; you, the great middle class, built this country. And unions built the middle class.
And it's time—in this time, we'll rebuild the middle class. We're going to bring everybody along. Regardless of your background, your color, your religion—no matter—everybody gets to come along.
So today I'm proposing a plan for the Nation that rewards work, not just rewards wealth. It builds a fair economy that gives everybody a chance to succeed, and it's going to create the strongest, most resilient, innovative economy in the world. It's not a plan that tinkers around the edges. It's a once-in-a generation investment in America, unlike anything we've seen or done since we built the Interstate Highway System and the space race decades ago.
In fact, it's the largest American jobs investment since World War II. It will create millions of jobs, good-paying jobs. It will grow the economy, make us more competitive around the world, promote our national security interests, and put us in a position to win the global competition with China in the upcoming years.
It's big? Yes. It's bold? Yes. And we can get it done.
It has two parts: the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. Both are essential to our economic future. In a few weeks, I'll talk about the Americans Family Plan, but today I want to talk about the Americans Jobs Plan.
I'll begin with the heart of the plan: It modernizes transportation infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our airports. I just left your airport. The director of the airport said, ""We're about to renovate the airport."" Is that right, Mr. County Executive? ""We're going to renovate. We're going to employ thousands of people."" And she looked at me and said, ""I can't thank you enough for this plan.""
It grows the economy in key ways. It puts people to work to repair and upgrade so—that we badly need. It makes it easier and more efficient to move goods, to get to work, and to make us more competitive around the world.
Some of your local officials know, when someone wants to come into the area and a company wants to invest, what do they ask? ""Where's the first rail bed? How can I get to the railroad? What access to interstate do I have? What's the water like? Tell me about it."" And it goes on and on.
It's about infrastructure. The American Jobs Plan will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main streets that are in difficult, difficult shape right now. It will fix the Nation's 10 most economically significant bridges in America that require replacement. Remember that bridge that went down? We've got 10 of the most economically significant bridges with more commerce going across it that need to be replaced. We'll also repair 10,000 bridges, desperately needed upgrades to unclog traffic, keep people safe, and connect our cities, towns, and Tribes across the country.
The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days. It will reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports.
The American Jobs Plan will lead to a transformational progress in our effort to tackle climate change with American jobs and American ingenuity. It will protect our community from billions of dollars of damage from historic superstorms, floods, wildfires, droughts, year after year, by making our infrastructure more secure and resilient and seizing incredible opportunities for American workers and American farmers in a clean energy future.
Skilled workers, like one we just heard from, building a nationwide network of 500,000 charging stations, creating good-paying jobs by leading the world in the manufacturing and export of clean electric cars and trucks.
We're going to provide tax incentives and point-of-sale rebates to help all American families afford clean vehicles of the future. The Federal Government owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which are going to be transitioned to clean electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles right here in the United States, by American workers, with American products.
When we make all these investments, we're going to make sure, as the Executive order I signed early on, that we buy American. That means investing in American-based companies and American workers. Not a contract will go out, that I control, that will not go to a company that is an American company with American products, all the way down the line, and American workers.
And we'll buy the goods we need from all of America, communities that have historically been left out of these investments: Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, rural, small businesses, entrepreneurs across the country.
Look, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes—where they get their water from—pipes that are lead-based pipes, including pipes for drinking water. According to scientists, there is simply no safe exposure to lead for a child. Lead can slow development, cause learning behaviors and hearing problems.
The American Jobs Plan will put plumbers and pipefitters to work, replacing 100 percent of the Nation's lead pipes and service lines so every American, every child can turn on a faucet or a fountain and drink clean water.
With each $5,000 investment replacing a line, that can mean up to $22,000 in health care costs saved, a chance to protect our children, help them learn and thrive. We can't delay. We can't delay another minute. It's long past due.
You know, in America, where the early interest was in internet—this thing called the internet that we invested—we invented, the early internet was invented here. Millions of Americans, though, lack access to reliable high-speed internet, including more than 35 percent of rural America.
It's a disparity even more pronounced during this pandemic. American Jobs will make sure every single—every single—American has access to high quality, affordable, high-speed internet for businesses, for schools. And when I say ""affordable,"" I mean it. Americans pay too much for internet service. We're going to drive down the price for families who have service now, and make it easier for families who don't have affordable service to be able to get it now.
As you saw in Texas and elsewhere, our electrical power grids are vulnerable to storms, catastrophic failures, and security lapses, with tragic results.
My American Jobs Plan will put hundreds of thousands of people to work—hundreds of thousands of people to work—line workers, electricians, and laborers—laying thousands of miles of transmission line; building a modern, resilient, and fully clean grid; and capping hundreds of thousands of old, literally, orphan oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up because they're abandoned, paying the same exact rate that a union man or woman would get having dug that well in the first place.
We'll build, upgrade, and weatherize affordable, energy-efficient housing and commercial buildings for millions of Americans.
Even before the pandemic, millions of working families faced enormous financial and personal strain trying to raise their kids and care for their parents at the same time—the so-called ""sandwich generation""—or family members with disability. You've got a child at home, you can't stay home from work to take care of that child unless you lose—you're going to put the child at risk, or you lose your job; or you have an elderly parent you're taking care of. And seniors and people with disabilities living independently feel that strain as well. But we know, if they can remain independently living, they live longer.
The American Jobs Plan is going to help in big ways. It's going to extend access to quality, affordable home- or community-based care. Think of expanded vital services like programs for seniors, or think of homecare workers going into homes of seniors and people with disabilities, cooking meals, helping them get around their homes, and helping them be able to live more independently.
For too long, caregivers—who are disproportionately women and women of color and immigrants—have been unseen, underpaid, and undervalued. This plan, along with the American Families Plan, changes that with better wages, benefits, and opportunities for millions of people who will be able to get to work in an economy that works for them.
You know, decades ago, the United States Government used to spend 2 percent of its GDP—its gross domestic product—on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1 percent. I think it's seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Here's why that matters: We're one of only a few major economies in the world whose public investment in research and development as a share of GDP has declined constantly over the last 25 years. And we've fallen back. The rest of the world is closing in and closing in fast.
We can't allow this to continue. The American Jobs Plan is the biggest increase in our Federal nondefense research-and-development spending on record. It's going to boost America's innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs: markets like battery technology, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy, the competition with China in particular.
Critics say we shouldn't spend this money. They ask, ""What do we get out of it?"" Well, they said the same thing when we first flew into space for the first time. They said the same thing. Well, pushing the frontiers led to big benefits back home. When NASA created Apollo's digital flight control system—unheard of at the time—it led to technologies that help us today to drive our cars and fly our planes. When NASA invented ways to keep food safe for the astronauts, it led to programs that have been used to—for decades to keep food safe in supermarkets. At least 2,000 products and services have been developed and commercialized as a result of American space exploration.
GPS has helped us find each other. Computer chips allow us to see and talk to one another, even when we're separated by mountains and oceans: singing ""Happy Birthday"" and watching the first steps of that new baby grandchild; comforting each other when comfort is needed. Think about what it means to you and your loved ones. We just have to imagine again.
I had a long discussion with Xi Jinping, the leader of China, when he called to congratulate me. We spent two hours on the phone. And he said—and I was astonished, my national security team and the China experts who were on the line—he said, ""You've always said, Mr. President, that you can define America in one word: possibilities."" That's who we are.
In America, anything is possible. Like what we did with vaccines a decade ago that laid the foundation for COVID-19 vaccines we have today. Like we did when the Interstate Highway System that transformed the way we traveled, lived, worked, and developed.
Americans could visit relatives anywhere in the country with just a family station wagon. Businesses here in Pittsburgh could load up a truck and get a product to Portland or Phoenix. To this day, about a quarter of all the miles Americans drive each year on one of those very original highways.
Imagine what we can do, what's within our reach, when we modernize those highways. You and your family could travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas onboard a high-speed train. We can connect high-speed, affordable, reliable internet wherever you live. Imagine knowing that you're handing your children and grandchildren a country that will lead the world in producing clean energy technology and will need to address one of the biggest threats of our time. That's what we'll do.
Altogether, along with the American Rescue Plan, the proposal I put forward will create millions of jobs, estimated by some Wall Street outfits, over 18 million jobs over 4 years; good-paying jobs. It also works to level the playing field, empower workers, and ensure that the new jobs are good jobs that you can raise a family on, and ensure free and fair choice to organize and bargain collectively.
That's why my plan asked Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act—the PRO Act—and send it to my desk.
This plan is important, not only for what and how it builds, but it's also important to where we build. It includes everyone, regardless of your race or your ZIP Code. Too often, economic growth and recovery is concentrated on the coast. Too often, investments have failed to meet the needs of marginalized communities left behind.
There is talent, innovation everywhere. And this plan connects that talent through cities, small towns, rural communities; through our businesses and our universities; through our entrepreneurs, union workers all across America.
We have to move now. Because I'm convinced that if we act now, in 50 years, people are going to look back and say this was the moment that America won the future. What I'm proposing is a one-time capital investment of roughly $2 trillion in America's future, spread largely over 8 years. It will generate historic job growth, historic economic growth, help businesses to compete internationally, create more revenue as well. They are among the highest value investments we can make in the Nation, investing in our infrastructure. But put it another way, failing to make these investments adds to our debt and effectively puts our children at a disadvantage relative to our competitors. That's what crumbling infrastructure does. And our infrastructure is crumbling. We're ranked 13th in the world.
What's more, it heightens our vulnerability to—it attracts our adversaries to compete in ways that they haven't up to now. And our adversaries are worried about us building this critical infrastructure.
Put simply, these are investments we have to make. We can afford to make them—or, put another way, we can't afford not to.
So how do we pay for it? I spoke to the majority leader and—no longer—I guess he's no longer the majority leader—[laughter]—he has been for a long time. I spoke for the Republican—I spoke to the Republican leader about the plan. Everybody is for doing something on infrastructure. Why haven't we done it? Well, no one wants to pay for it.
Less than 4 years ago, as I said, the Congress passed a tax cut of $2 trillion, increasing the national debt $2 trillion. It didn't meet virtually any of the predictions it would in terms of growing the economy. Overwhelmingly, the benefits of that tax package went to the wealthiest Americans. It even included new investments that would profit by shifting profits and jobs overseas if you're a corporation. It was bad for American competitiveness, deeply unfair to the middle class families, and wrong for our future.
So, here's what I'd do. I start with one rule: No one—let me say it again—no one making under $400,000 will see their Federal taxes go up. Period. This is not about penalizing anyone. I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires. I believe American—in American capitalism. I want everyone to do well.
But here's the deal: Right now a middle class couple—a firefighter and a teacher with two kids—making a combined salary of, say, $110-, $120,000 a year pays 22 cents for each additional dollar they earn in Federal income tax. But a multinational corporation that builds a factory abroad—brings it home and then sell it—they pay nothing at all. We're going to raise the corporate tax. It was 35 percent, which is too high. We all agreed, 5 years ago, it should go down to 28 percent, but they reduced it to 21 percent. We're going to raise it back to—up to 28 percent.
No one should be able to complain about that. It's still lower than what that rate was between World War II and 2017. Just doing that one thing will generate $1 trillion in additional revenue over 15 years.
In 2019, an independent analysis found that are 91—let me say it again, 91 Fortune 500 companies—the biggest companies in the world, including Amazon—they used various loopholes so they'd pay not a single, solitary penny in Federal income tax. I don't want to punish them, but that's just wrong. That's just wrong. A fireman and a teacher paying 22 percent? Amazon and 90 other major corporations are paying zero in Federal taxes?
I'm going to put an end to that, and here's how we'll do it. We're establishing a global minimum tax for U.S. corporations of 21 percent. We're going to level the international playing field. That alone will raise $1 trillion over 15 years.
We'll also eliminate deductions by corporations for offshoring jobs and shifting assets overseas. You do that, you pay a penalty; you don't get a reward in my plan. And use the savings from that to give companies tax credits to locate manufacturing here—in manufacturing and production here in the United States.
And we'll significantly ramp up the IRS enforcement against corporations who either fail to report their incomes or under-report. It's estimated that could raise hundreds of billions of dollars. All of this adds up to more than what I've proposed to spend in just 15 years. It's honest. It's fiscally responsible. And by the way, as the experts will tell you, it reduces the debt—the Federal debt—over the long haul.
But let me be clear: These are my ideas on how to pay for this plan. If others have additional ideas, let them come forward. I'm open to other ideas, so long as they do not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000.
Let me close with this: Historically, infrastructure has been a bipartisan undertaking, many times led by Republicans. It was Abraham Lincoln who built the transcontinental railroad; Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, the Interstate Highway System. I could go on.
And I don't think you'll find a Republican today in the House or Senate—maybe I'm wrong, gentlemen—who doesn't think we have to improve our infrastructure. They know China and other countries are eating our lunch. So there's no reason why it can't be bipartisan again. The divisions of the moment shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing for the future.
I'm going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office; listen to them, what they have to say; and be open to other ideas. We'll have a good-faith negotiation with any Republican who wants to help get this done. But we have to get it done.
I truly believe we're in a moment where history is going to look back on this time as a fundamental choice having to be made between democracies and autocracies. You know, there's a lot of autocrats in the world who think the reason why they're going to win is democracies can't reach consensus any longer; autocracies do.
That's what competition between America and China and the rest of the world is all about. It's a basic question: Can democracies still deliver for their people? Can they get a majority? I believe we can. I believe we must.
Delivering for the American people is what the American Rescue Plan was all about. And it's been overwhelmingly popular. When I wrote it, everybody said I had no bipartisan support. We're overwhelming bipartisan support with Republican—registered Republican voters. And ask around. If you live in a town with a Republican mayor, a Republican county executive, or a Republican Governor, ask them how many would rather get rid of the plan. Ask them if it helped them at all.
It's what the American Jobs Plan is about, the new one I'm proposing. I hope Republicans in Congress will join this effort. I hope and believe a number of businesses will join this effort. And I hope and believe the American people will join this effort: Democrats, Republican, and Independents.
We can do this. We have to do this. We will do this. We just have to remember: This is the United States of America. And I've said it a thousand times: There's nothing beyond our capacity if we act together. So it's time to move together.
Thank you. And I hope I get to come back to see you folks after this plan is passed. And the question is: You have to attract even more apprentices, more people, because the—we're building so much.

And the Vice President, thank you——
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Of course.
The President. ——for your focus on small business.
We're pushing lenders to raise their game and provide more help to small—many small businesses. As you know, particularly Hispanic, as well as African American small businesses are just out of business because they got bypassed the first time around.
Today I'm proud to sign the extension, which I'm going to do in a second, of the Paycheck Protection Program. It is a bipartisan accomplishment.
Nearly 90,000 business owners are still in line, and there's money left. Without somebody signing this bill today, there are hundreds of thousands of people who could lose their jobs, and small and family businesses that might close forever. And, as you know, small business is the backbone of our economy, representing almost 50 percent of all the employees in America.
And I want to thank Senators Cardin, Shaheen, Rubio, and Collins for their work in the Senate—it was a bipartisan effort—and Young Kim and Velazquez, as well as Luetkemeyer for their work in the House to make sure this happened.
And, the last 2 months, we've approved forgivable loans for three-thousand—excuse me, three-million-six-hundred small businesses—six-hundred-thousand small businesses. And three-million-three-hundred [thousand]* of those small businesses were less than—higher—had fewer than 20 employees, which is the backbone of most of the communities.
So, with that, I'm going to sign this. And thank you all for coming.

29-Mar-21,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and the National Vaccination Effort and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon. Last week, we set a goal of 200 million shots by day 100 of our administration, double the original goal that I had said. And to make that progress, over the last 3 days, we've had a record number of shots in arms with over 10 million shots recorded in the weekend. Over 10 million shots in 3 days—that would have been inconceivable in January.
The progress we've made on vaccinating this country is a great American story. The Federal Government has stepped up, taken responsibility, and launched a massive Federal vaccination program. Governors and mayors of both political parties—Republicans and Democrats—have stepped up as well. Our military, our National Guard, FEMA—they have all been incredible. Health care providers, community leaders from all walks of life, so many volunteers of all ages and backgrounds stepped up as well. And my fellow Americans, look at what we have done the past 10 weeks. No other country has come close: 100 million shots in less than 60 days, and now we're moving on to the next 100 million shots in just 40 days.
You've heard me say it many times before: Our progress on vaccination is a stunning example that there is nothing—nothing—this country cannot do if we put our minds to it and we do it together. But as I've also said, I will always give you it straight, straight from the shoulder. Our work is far from over. The war against COVID-19 is far from won. This is deadly serious.
We share the sentiment of Dr. Walensky, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC expressed earlier today: This is not the time to lessen our efforts. That's what she said. We could still see a setback in the vaccination program. And most importantly, if we let our guard down now, we could see a virus getting worse, not better.
You know, as many people as we have vaccinated, we still have more Americans left to go. You know, we will administer more shots in March than any country on Earth. But even so, we have to give more shots in April than we did in March. Because we're in the life-and-death race for the virus that is spreading quickly with cases rising again. New variants are spreading. And sadly, some of the reckless behavior we've seen on television over the past few weeks means that more new cases are to come in the weeks ahead.
With vaccines, there's hope, which is a—which is a very good thing, to state the obvious. But people are letting up on precautions, which is a very bad thing. Look, to this point, cases have fallen two-thirds since I took office. Deaths have also fallen two-thirds. But now cases are going back up, and in some States, deaths are as well. You know, we're giving up hard-fought, hard-won gains. And as much as we are doing, America, it is time to do even more. All of us have to do our part, every one of us.
So let me start here: First, this week, thanks to my administration's intensive work with vaccine manufacturers and distribution efforts, the amount of vaccines that are going to be available for vaccinators—vaccination sites will be a new record: 33 million doses of vaccine this week.
By getting more vaccine supply to States, community health centers, and pharmacies, we can vaccinate the highest risk Americans even more quickly than we already are. And then, we make it possible to open up supplies for all adults and to try to beat the renewed spread of this virus. As a result, I'm also pleased to announce that we're on track this week—just 10 weeks after I became President—to achieve nearly 75 percent of Americans over the age of 65 getting at least one vaccination shot. When I took office on January 20, that number was 8 percent. It's going to 75 percent. That's a lot of grandparents who are now able to safely hug their grandchildren, and they couldn't do so just a short time ago.
And with the supply we're releasing this week—just this week alone—there are more doors—there are more doses of vaccine available for seniors this week than any week thus far. So, seniors, please, if you have not gotten your shot yet, get it this week. Get it.
Second, I'm reiterating my call for every Governor, mayor, and local leader to maintain and reinstate the mask mandate. Please, this is not politics. Reinstate the mandate if you let it down. And businesses should require masks as well. The failure to take this virus seriously—precisely what got us in this mess in the first place—risks more cases and more deaths.
Look, as I do my part to accelerate the vaccine distribution and vaccinations, I need the American people to do their part as well. Mask up. Mask up. It's a patriotic duty. It's the only way we ever get back to normal: to cheer together in stadiums full of fans; to gather together on holidays again safely; go to graduations, weddings.
Third, I announced on March 11 I'd direct every State, Territory, and Tribe to open up their vaccinations to all adults no later than May 1. I issued that order because moving beyond priority groups to enable all adults to get vaccinated is critical to having a July 4 that's closer to normal. I want this to come as quickly as possible.
And I want to thank the Governors—Democrats and Republicans—who have responded to this directive. In fact, the vast majority of Governors have set open access dates even earlier than the deadline of May 1. But in this race against the rapidly spreading virus, as fast as we are going, we need to go faster.
So to make it easier for Americans to get vaccinated as the supply grows and vaccination eligibility expands, I'm directing my COVID team to ensure there is a vaccine site within 5 miles of 90 percent of all Americans by April the 19th, 3 weeks from today.
Look, we're going to do this by growing from having 17,000 pharmacies giving out vaccination shots to nearly 40,000 pharmacies doing it within the next 3 weeks. That will more than double the number of pharmacies where you can go get vaccinated. But we aren't stopping there.
In the next 3 weeks, we'll add 12 more Federally run mass vaccination sites. Every day at these sites, tens of thousands of people are able to drive up, get a vaccine shot while in their car, and leave in less than an hour. And over 60 percent of the shots given at these sites goes to minority communities because they're in minority communities. We have to reach out. They're the ones most affected by the vaccine—by both the vaccine, but also by the pandemic.
We're also going to send more aid to States to expand the opening of more community vaccination sites—more vaccines, more sites, more vaccinators—all designed to speed our critical work. But we also need to make it easier for those who want shots but cannot access vaccination sites to get vaccinated. This is also where we're focused on the seniors most immediately.
While we have made incredible progress in starting to vaccinate nearly three-quarters of our seniors and now putting vaccination sites within 5 miles of 90 percent of all Americans, that still isn't enough as far as we're concerned. We know that there are a number of seniors and people with disabilities who may be isolated and have lack of access to transportation, and there are community groups that can help. They're trying to help now.
So our fourth announcement today is that I'm sending out millions of dollars, through the Department of Health and Human Service, to provide assistance, including transportation, so more vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities can get their shots, because they get help to physically get there, to get the shot. Neighbors helping neighbors: What a truly American effort. We cannot let transportation be a barrier to any senior getting a vaccination.
And so where does this put us? We're making progress on vaccinations, but cases are rising, and the virus is spreading in too many places still. That's why, today, I'm taking these steps to make our American turnaround story a—our vaccination program move even faster. Thanks to all the work we've done these past 10 weeks, the added steps I'm announcing today—with them—I'm pleased to announce that at least 90 percent of all adults in this country will be eligible to be vaccinated by April the 19th, just 3 weeks from now, because we have the vaccines.
For the vast, vast majority of adults, you won't have to wait till May 1. You'll be eligible for your shot on April 19. Finally, 10 percent will be eligible no later than—the final 10 percent will be eligible no later than May 1.
And as I just said, due to the steps we're taking today, 90 percent of Americans will be within 5 miles of a location where they can get a shot as of April the 19th. So we're moving toward ""90/90"" by April 19. That is, by April 19, 3 weeks from today, 90 percent of adults—people over 18 and over—will be eligible get vaccinated. Ninety percent of all Americans will be living within 5 miles of a place they can get a shot.
And of course, it will take time for everyone to get their appointment. It's a big country. And as fast as we're going, and we still have a long way to go to finish this vaccination effort. In fact, we aren't even there—we aren't halfway yet. But being at 90/90 just 3 weeks from today should give hope to the country.
Let me close with this: The progress we're making is a significant testament to what we can do when we work together as Americans. But as I've always said, we still need everyone to do their part. We still are in a war with this deadly virus. And we're bolstering our defenses, but this war is far from won.
Together, we have so much to be proud of in the past 3 weeks—past more than 3 weeks, past 10 weeks. We also have so much to be sorrowful about. Nearly 1,000 Americans a day are still dying from COVID-19 as we approach 550,000 deaths in a single year.
Until this country is vaccinated, each of us has to do our part. We have an obligation—a patriotic obligation: Wash your hands, stay socially distanced, wear a mask as recommended by the CDC, and get vaccinated. Get your friends and family vaccinated when you can help.
Now is not the time to let down. Now is not the time to celebrate. It is time to do what we do best as a country: our duty, our jobs; take care of one another; and fight this to the finish. We can and will do this, but don't let up now. Don't let up now.
Thank you. And may God protect our troops. Thank you very much.
Rise in Coronavirus Cases 
Q. Mr. President, Dr. Walensky said she's scared of an ""impending doom"" with COVID cases on the rise. Are you?

Coronavirus Prevention Efforts

26-Mar-21,"Remarks at a Virtual Fundraiser for Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, Georgia","[The President spoke via video conference from his residence in Wilmington, Delaware.]
Well, look, Mayor—can you hear me now? I truly apologize to everybody, especially on a Friday afternoon, as the mayor said.
I want to thank the mayor for her leadership, and more importantly, I want to thank her for her friendship. And for everyone on this call, you should know that Keisha endorsed me, as I said, very early in my campaign, back when most folks didn't think I had a chance. She stuck with me when things were bad and—[inaudible]. But through it all, she believed in me, and I'm forever grateful.
But maybe the person I should be thanking most is Keisha's mom. Keisha often tells me stories about how her best polling source is her mom and what her mom is hearing about at the bridge club every Saturday. Well, when Keisha's mom said she believed in me, I guess that was good enough for Keisha. And just like she had my back, I have hers.
And we need her, and Atlanta needs her. You know, we saw it just weeks after—just weeks after we found ourselves—[inaudible]—to the mass shooting. When the Vice President—when I—when the Vice President and I traveled to Atlanta, we met with the mayor and saw her strength keeping the city together, especially for the Asian American community that remains in fear and is hurting right now.
And we've seen her leadership during this pandemic, believing in science and leading a city that's home to a tremendous public servant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC. We saw her stand tall and speak out during the summer of protests and pain. And during the campaign that tested our very democracy, she was always there. So many of you stepped up as well.
And if anyone ever doubted that voting matters, Georgia just proved that it did. If anyone ever wondered if one vote can make a difference, Georgia proved it 11,779 times. And if anyone ever wondered if voting can change a country, Georgia just proved that. And if you're wondering whether Republican officials will finally stop their attacks on the right to vote and actually try and win over votes, they just proved yesterday they won't. It's—[inaudible]—America and what they're doing—that it cannot stand.
So, above all, Keisha knows democracy is not just about winning elections. It's about governing, making government work. It's about making government work for working families, for the people who are the backbone of this country.
And that's why we fought so hard to pass the American Rescue Plan. It's making a difference. Just last week, we passed 100 million shots in arms in the first 58 days in office. We're going to get—[inaudible]—200 million in my first 100 days. That includes a $10 billion investment to make sure we reach the hardest hit and highest risk communities.
And yesterday we reached 100 million checks for $1,400 into people's pockets and their bank accounts. By the time this money is distributed, 88 percent of all adults and children in Georgia will receive such a check. That's going to change their lives. The American Rescue Plan will cut child poverty literally in half, including for 171,000 Georgia children. It provides $4 billion for Georgia's schoolchildren, in grades K through 12, to keep them open and keep them open safely.
And one of the biggest things for Georgia and the Atlantic—and Atlanta: Georgia is now eligible for about $2 billion in expanded Medicaid. That means another 500,000 Georgians will be covered all across the State with Medicaid that they don't have right now. And that's on top of the lower premiums and expanded coverage, if you have a plan through Obamacare.
Your State—the State of Georgia—will also get around $5 billion to make up for the lost revenues. Local governments will get around $3.5 billion. That's going to make it possible to keep police officers, firefighters, teachers, first responders on the job, rather than have to lay them off because of a lack of funding.
And who is going to deliver this help on the ground? The mayor. The mayor. But that's just the beginning.
And as we rescue the economy in the coming weeks, I'll be laying out my vision for a Build Back Better plan to rebuild America's own 21st century, modernizing our infrastructure: our transportation systems, our broadband systems, our water and power systems.
And we're going to make historic investments in research and development, and we're going to create millions—and it's not just me; it's not just a Democratic think tank. Wall Street has pointed out millions of good-paying jobs here in America—manufacturing, clean energy, and so much more. Just manufacturing in general.
A big piece of that, as the mayor knows and as I promised on the campaign, is historic investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities to help the next generation of Black students get access to good-paying jobs now and in the future.
We're also going to invest in our families, making—[inaudible]—housing more affordable, and caregiving economy stronger for millions of Americans, mostly women and women of color who care for children and aging loved ones. And they deserve to be paid well.
All this is going to help us outcompete the rest of the world, and it will depend on government being able to work for the American people. That's why I need people like Keisha leading the way, and I really mean that.
I'm going to close with this—I've kept you too long already: There is so much we can do if we do it together, if we stand together; if we once again believe and invest in science; if we stand up for justice and equality and the right of Americans to vote and have access to voting.
And Keisha is leading our efforts as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. You have to remember, we're here to help all the people of this country, the bottom up and the middle out, not just those in the top few. Folks, if we do that, then there's not a single solitary thing we can't do if we do it together.
So to Keisha and to all of you, I apologize for the mixup. I'm not—I don't want to be fastidious about making sure—[inaudible]—to do this. So I'm—[inaudible]—home, and we just got a little messed up here. But I truly apologize.
And I—and again, let me thank all of you who—that we called on our contribution list, asking about Keisha—[inaudible]—coming through. She is the real deal. She's bright. She's honorable. She's tough. She has great integrity. And it really matters that we have people like Keisha to—[inaudible].
So, Keisha, I want to thank you as well for being my buddy. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Have a good weekend. Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 5:37 p.m. from his residence. In his remarks, he referred to Sylvia Robinson, mother of Mayor Bottoms.

24-Mar-21,Remarks on Equal Pay Day,"The President. Well, good afternoon, everyone. Megan and Margaret, thank you. Thank you for being here. And to all your teammates virtually, thank you as well. I'm an unadulterated fan. [Laughter] Not a joke. Not a joke.
And both of you and your entire team—I'm not joking—have inspired our daughters and our granddaughters, who, I might add, are all really good athletes: one two-time All-State; my niece, All-American. There's a whole lot of talent in the Biden family athletics, almost all on the women's side of the equation. [Laughter] But I—really, thank you for what you've done.
You know, you're all heroes for so many people—and that's not hyperbole to suggest that—on and off the field. You know, and it matters that you lent your voice to the issues and the issue of fair pay and decency for so many years.
Megan, it's hard to believe it was almost a year ago that we met virtually during the campaign. I said it last April, when we spoke, and I'll say it again: The fact that Jill and I get to talk with you and your teammates makes us heroes with our granddaughters. Not a joke. I went so far as I took—they might may say—a privilege of getting our granddaughter Maisy, who is a rising junior at the University of Pennsylvania—up taking a course right now—I got her on the phone so she—all she wanted to do was meet both of these women and meet them virtually. And she's a soccer player.
And as Jill mentioned, seeing you win the World Cup back in 2015, that was an incredible moment for our family and our country. And I didn't bore you with all the pictures we still have walking on the field—[laughter]—no, I'm serious—and off the field. You all made me a hero with my granddaughters.
And the reason we're here today is because it's Equal Pay Day, which has been around for 25 years. It was declared 25 years ago—Equal Pay Day—though not enough people know about that and they—as they should. You know, it's a day that measures how much longer women typically have to work to match what men make in a single year. That's what Jill was talking about. And it's shocking when you look at the numbers.
Twelve years ago, when President Obama and I came into office, the very first law we enacted was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and Lilly was standing at our side. This year—that year, I should say, in 2009, we marked—Equal Pay Day occurred in late April. By late April, women will have made, at that time, on average, what men make in 12 months. They had to go all the way through January, February, March, and April to catch up. That meant that it took women until April of 2009 to earn the same amount of money that a man made in all of 2008.
Another way to look at it is, it took more than 15 months for a woman to earn the same amount that a man made in 12. And more than 3 extra months—it's more than that. And it's even longer for women of color. And it's wrong.
This year, Equal Pay Day falls in late March, which is a little bit better, but not much: from late April to late March. And frankly, we shouldn't be satisfied until Equal Pay Day is no longer even necessary to mention at all.
The reality, though, is that in nearly every job—more than 90 percent of the occupations—women still earn less than men: 82 cents on the dollar on average. For AAPI women, it's 87 cents for every dollar a white man earns. For Black women, it's 63 cents. For Native American women, it's 60 cents. For Hispanic women, it's 55 cents.
It doesn't matter if you're an electrician, an accountant, or part of the best damn soccer team in the world, the pay gap is real. And this team is living proof that you can be the very best at what you do and still have to fight for equal pay.
You know, as Jill mentioned, this pandemic has only exacerbated the problem. Women are on the frontlines as essential workers, particularly women of color, in hospitals, grocery stores, childcare facilities, farms, factories, but they're still earning less.
More than 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce since the pandemic started—2 million. And now we're at the lowest rate of women participation in the labor force that we've been in more than 30 years. Let me say it again: The lowest percent of women in the workforce—had to go back 30 years to get to where we are today.
A lot of that is because so much extra weight of caregiving and responsibility is falling on their shoulders. It causes women to miss work, cut hours, and leave their jobs and care for their children and aging loved ones. That in and of itself sows some discrimination. How many men are staying home and doing it, and the woman's staying in the workforce?
It undermines financial security. And, by the way, it's hard. I was a single parent with two children after my first wife and daughter were killed well over 40 years ago. And the fact of the matter is, I was a U.S. Senator. I was 29 years old. I was making $42,000 a year, and I couldn't afford help to take care of my kids while I worked. Thankful—thankfully, my mother—my sister gave up her job. My brother—they helped me raise my kids.
It undermines financial security for women and families. It hurts our entire economy when we lose the talent and hard work of so many people.
In the American Rescue Plan you've heard so much about that we just passed, it was designed to address this core challenge. It puts money directly into the pockets of people who need it the most: $1,400 checks for 85 percent of American households. The hundredth million check has been deposited as of today, and many more are on the way.
It also expanded the childcare tax credit. And here's what that means, for those who don't know: Right now, if you file for Federal income tax, you get up to a $2,000 credit for each child. But if you need help the most, if you're making a minimum wage job and you don't have to—you don't make enough to pay Federal income tax, then you don't get this credit.
But because of the American Rescue Plan we passed, if you have two children under the age of six, for example, and you're making $7.25 an hour—which is the minimum wage that so many people are making—you'll get a check for $3,600 per child or $7,200. Roughly, you get $500 a month mailed to you by the Federal Government. That's life-changing.
The American Rescue Plan is going to cut poverty across the board in America by about 31 percent. And that's a significant lift up for women. The law provides $360 billion for funding State and local governments. What that means is that's going to prevent layoffs on jobs often held by women—nurses, teachers, health care workers, home health care aides—because the States have to balance their budget, because if they can't—because of the lack of income coming in without the help from the Federal Government—they'll have to lay off those essential workers.
And the law also includes $130 billion to reopen our schools safely; $40 billion for—invest in childcare investments; $160 billion to get the country vaccinated and beat this pandemic. All this is going to give millions of women, including many moms and dads too, the freedom to rejoin the workforce and make the career choices that are best for them and their families. But there's so much more we need to do. So much more. We need the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, the bill to remove loopholes in the law allowing employers to justify gender pay disparities. It would help hold employers accountable for systemic pay discrimination. It would help level the playing field for women and people of color by making it easier for workers to challenge the disparities as a group. It would increase pay transparency.
By that, I mean, you know, there's a whole range of American corporations—if you sign the Fortune 500—you sign up with them, you cannot reveal—it says in your contract you cannot reveal your salary to another employee. Why is that? They don't want me sitting there saying, ""Well, I'm making $60,000."" And the woman doing the same job, and she looks and said: ""You're making 60? I'm making 40."" They actually try to hide it. That's what I mean by transparency.
Some employers may not allow you to know exactly, like I said, how much the person sitting next to you is making. Some may even discipline you for asking that. That has to change. Too often, secrecy is part of the problem. We know information is power. You can't solve the problem if you don't know you're not getting paid fairly.
My administration is going to fight for equal pay—for it to become a reality for all women. It's about justice. It's about fairness. It's about living up to our values and who we are as a nation. Equal pay makes all of us stronger.
It's not just women who care about this. I've been around the country. I've gone right into union halls and asked the men in the room, ""How many of you—how would you feel if your wife or your sister didn't earn the same amount of money as the man doing the same job next to you?"" And you hear them say—you hear them respond, they don't like it. Why? When your spouse or your sister is making the same amount of money the man she's standing next is making, it means that when the hot water heater breaks, you can replace it. You can get four new tires on the car. It means everybody's life is made better in that family.
Let me close with this: that to come out of this crisis and build back better, we need to erase the gender pay gap by ensuring that women have access to good-paying jobs; by raising wages for working folks and fighting for the right to organize and collectively bargain, because we know unions lift women's wages even more than they lift men's; and by investing our care—in our care infrastructure—our care infrastructure—in paid leave, childcare, homecare—so that people can care for their families and also go to work.
There's a lot to do, but together we can ensure that our daughters have all the same rights and opportunities as our sons. And if we're able to do this, it will be transformational for our Nation. That's the goal. That's what this is all about. That's what this team, all of you, are all about.
Let me make one more point. You know, I've told my daughters, granddaughters from the time they got old enough to understand what I was saying—and I mean it: There's not a single thing a man can do that a woman can't do as well or better. Not a single thing.
I was among the first Senators ever to appoint a woman to the Naval Academy. I was just able to, as President of the United States, appoint two women as four-star generals, who now are combatant commanders. Three out of the six are combatant commanders, and they're women. Women. There are so many, some in the Congress, who were jet fighter pilots flying at twice the speed of sound. So many doing so much.
But this soccer team, America's team, has done more to lift up people's sense of who they can be, particularly young girls and women, above anything that's been done. So, as President of the United States, I thank you. I thank you for the example you've set and for your willingness to say: ""Look, we're not going to take it anymore. We're not going to take it."" Figuratively speaking, ""You can take my trophies, but you can't take my pride."" As I said, my dad used to say, ""Joey, a job is""—when he lost his job and had to get another one. We had to move. He'd say: ""You know, Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your sense of yourself and your self-worth. It's about your place in the community."" That's what this is all about, and that's why you guys are leading the way.
And now it's my great pleasure and honor—I'd like you to stand next to me, if you would, while I sign a Proclamation making Equal Pay Day—naming it—an expression of our commitment to seek equal pay as we build back better and restore this economic growth.
Thank you, folks. I'm going to sign it now. Come on over here.
The title of the proclamation is ""National Equal Pay Day, 2021.""

24-Mar-21,Remarks with Vice President Harris in a Meeting on Immigration,"The President. Well folks, today I have two announcements to make. One is, we've got ourselves a Secretary. Xavier, welcome.
Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thanks for being willing to do this, and I really appreciate it. And also today, I've—I said when we became a team and got elected that the Vice President was going to be the last person in the room. She didn't realize that means she gets every assignment. [Laughter]
But the Vice President and I, and all of us here, have been working very hard to pass the legislation that is going to beat this virus, as well as get people back to work and change their prospects. And so she's traveling all over the country working that.
In addition to that, there's about five other major things she's handling, but I've asked her, the VP, today—because she's the most qualified person to do it—to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that help—are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border.
And you know, back when I was Vice President, I got a similar assignment, but one of the things we did was, we made sure that we got a bipartisan agreement with Democrats and Republicans to provide over $700 million to the countries in the Northern Triangle to determine the best way to keep people from coming is keep them from wanting to leave.
And the reason why so many people were leaving, we learned, was that not only gang violence and trafficking and cartels, but natural disasters, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes. And so it's not like someone sits around a hand-hewn table somewhere in Guatemala and says: ""I've got a great idea: Let's sell everything we have, give the money to a coyote, have him take our kids or us to the border of America, take us across, leave us in the desert. We don't speak the language. Won't that be fun?""
And one of the ways we learned is that if you deal with the problems in country, it benefits everyone. It benefits us, it benefits the people, and it grows the economies there.
Unfortunately, the last administration eliminated that funding—did not engage in it, did not use it—even though there was over $700 million to help get this done. We're reinstituting that program. And there are—as I said, there are many factors as to why people leave in the first place.
But this is the source of one of the reasons why we've had such a—before we took office, in the midst of the last administration's somewhat draconian policies of separating children from their parents, et cetera, what happened was that we found that there were a serious spike in the number of people heading to the southern border, even in the midst of that. And as Alejandro can tell you, is that was because there were serious natural disasters that occurred in those countries. They were coming north, and we did nothing to do any—much about it.
So this new surge we're dealing with now started with the last administration, but it's our responsibility to deal with it humanely and to stop what's happening. And so this increase has been consequential, but the Vice President has agreed—among the multiple other things that I have her leading—and I appreciate it—agreed to lead our diplomatic effort and work with those nations to accept the returnees, and enhance migration enforcement at their borders—at their borders.
We're already talking with Mexico about that; she's already done that. We're going to be dealing with a full team now that we have to be able to deal with the problem here at home, but also to deal with it now in terms of in country.
And I can think of nobody who is better qualified to do this than a former—this is a woman who ran the second largest attorney general's office in America—after the U.S.—after the United States Attorney General—in the State of California and has done a great deal upholding human rights, but also fighting organized crime in the process.
So it's not her full responsibility and job, but she's leading the effort, because I think the best thing to do is to put someone who, when he or she speaks, they don't have to wonder about is that where the President is. When she speaks, she speaks for me. Doesn't have to check with me. She knows what she's doing, and I hope we can move this along.
But—so, Madam Vice President, thank you. I gave you a tough job, and you're smiling, but there's no one better capable of trying to organize this for us.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Well, thank you, Mr. President and for having the confidence in me. And there's no question that this is a challenging situation. As the President has said, there are many factors that lead precedent to leave these countries. And while we are clear that people should not come to the border now, we also understand that we will enforce the law and that we also—because we can chew gum and walk at the same time—must address the root causes that cause people to make the trek, as the President has described, to come here.
And I look forward to engaging in diplomacy with government, with private sector, with civil society, and the leaders of each in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to strengthen democracy and the rule of law and ensure shared prosperity in the region.
We will collaborate with Mexico and other countries throughout the Western hemisphere. And as part of this effort, we expect that we will have collaborative relationships to accomplish the goals the President has and that we share.
I also look forward to working with Members of the Congress who, I think, share our perspective on the need to address root causes for the migration that we've been seeing. And needless to say, the work will not be easy, but it is important work. It is work that we demand—and the people of our countries, I believe, need—to help stem the tide that we have seen.
So thank you, Mr. President, for your confidence. Thank you.
The President. Well, thank you for willing to do it. Now we're going to get down to business here.

23-Mar-21,"Remarks on the 11th Anniversary of the Enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in Columbus, Ohio","The President. Tameka, thank you very much. I guess I'm supposed to keep this on, correct? Yes. So—good afternoon, almost getting into evening. Before I begin, as the Congresswoman said, earlier today at the White House, I addressed the mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado. While the investigation is ongoing—and I spent time on the telephone with the Attorney General, as well as the head of the FBI, this—the investigation is still ongoing.
My heart goes out to the families of the victims and the survivors. I want to commend the heroic actions of Officer Eric Talley, the father of seven children, who left for work yesterday morning assuming he'd be able to go home—and for the ultimate sacrifice for others.
Now, let me turn to why I came today: to talk about, initially, the American Rescue Plan and the progress we're making on tackling COVID. Tameka, thank you for sharing your stories and what you're doing—my daughter is also a social worker, and you have a profound impact on people's lives—and all you do to connect folks here in Ohio with the coverage and care they need.
I want to thank Joyce, Congresswoman, for sticking with me during the day, and Marcy, my old friend—good to see you, Marcy. Thanks for being here. And Tim Ryan. I always kid with Tim. If you're—if I got to be in a foxhole, he's the guy I want to be with. [Laughter] He always keeps his word, does exactly what he says he's going to do. And it's great seeing you, Tim. My best to the family.
And Madam President, thanks for having served in the Obama-Biden administration, and you're doing an incredible job here. And all of the docs that are here that I got a chance to meet with today: Thank you. You are—you're an incredible group of individuals.
I also want thank Sherrod Brown, who wanted to be here today, but he had to be in Washington to cast important votes in the United States Senate.
Look, I want everyone to be aware that there are three key parts to the American Rescue Plan all of my colleagues supported here. First, we're going to more rapidly acquire—and we set out to more rapidly acquire enough vaccine to vaccinate every single American quicker than anticipated.
And what my COVID team and—went through—and with the use of the Defense Production Act, we've been able to organize and help increase the number of doses in a much shorter time.
So, by the end of May, we're going to have on hand roughly 600 million doses, enough for every American. And the American Rescue Plan is also going to provide the funding for more vaccinations, vaccination sites, vaccinators, and the paraphernalia needed to put that vaccine in one's arm.
In addition, there is a second important piece of that plan. It's focused on dealing with the economic deprivation so many Americans have become subject to, a consequence to this virus, through no fault of their own. Millions have lost their jobs, and they're still out of work. Around 11 million children in America are going hungry through no fault of their own. But as a result of the pandemic and the economic crisis, millions of Americans are not able to maintain their mortgage payments or rental payments and have found themselves on the verge of being evicted and having their homes repossessed. But we stepped in, and we prevented that from happening with the American Rescue Plan. Hundreds of thousands of businesses are now—not going to go under, but they're going to have an idea—an opportunity to reopen and have the financial assistance to be able to do it the right way and safely.
Schools closed and children losing up to a year or more in learning capacity. You're ahead of the States here in Ohio, but, across the Nation, the help was badly needed, and we've now provided the funding for that.
Because of isolation—and violence against women is up; abuse of children is up—and the need for mental health problems—to deal with mental health problems and the consequence of them is up, as a consequence of COVID. And, in addition to that, suicides are up.
The second—so, second, the American Rescue Plan brings relief to a population that's badly hurting. And one more element of our response is that—first and foremost, is the commitment to get Americans a $1,400 check per person, including per child. So a firefighter and school teacher making $120,000 combined, with two kids, are going to get a $5,600 in cash.
If they already have an account online with the IRS, which many do, by tomorrow, we will have distributed 100 million of those checks just since the legislation passed. We're on the verge of doing that as of tomorrow. But for someone who doesn't have direct deposit, they're getting a check in the mail for all of that.
So we expand the child—we also expanded the Childcare Tax Credit. Right now, if you file your Federal income tax, you'll get to a $2,000 deduction for every child you have. But if you're making the minimum wage, you don't earn enough to file for Federal taxes. But because of the American Rescue Plan, if you have two children, for example, under the age of 6, you're going to get a check for $3,600 if you have a child. And so, if you have two children, $7,200 will be paid on a monthly basis. This is going to be life changing. It's estimated this will do more to end child poverty in America than anything we've ever done.
There's also the Earned Income Tax Credit. If you are over the age of 19 and not a full-time student and you are a childless worker, now you will get a check for $1,500 if you file.
Small businesses not only will be able to borrow money to keep business afloat, but get loan forgiveness in improving your business to get us back in the game.
And by the way, all of this—economists left, right, and center argue and acknowledge—will create 7 million more jobs and increase economic growth. Increase economic growth.
There's so much more, but help is here. But I'm here in this great hospital to talk about a third way to help. And that is for your health—the third type of help, and that's health care.
I just concluded a tour of the Radiation Oncology Department here at the James Cancer Center, which was expanded thanks to a $100 million grant in the Affordable Care Act that Sherrod Brown was instrumental in making happen. That's in addition to the research funding Ohio State received under the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot.
Because of our investments, this department has gone from being able to treat 60 to 70 patients a day to nearly 300 a day. This place is a source of hope. I have said that I want to—when I ran, I said I wanted to be a President who would preside over the end of cancer as we know it.
And when we see the strides we've made—you talk to the docs and researchers—I can tell you, it's within our reach. We're all benefited from the breakthroughs pioneered by the Defense Department, for example, research agency called DARPA, which helped bring us everything from the internet to GPS. Well, I'm going to be proposing to my friends in Congress that we launch a similar operation at the Department of—at the Department of Health—a new effort called ""ARPA-H""—to deliver health breakthroughs to find cures for cancer and other diseases by investing billions of dollars that companies are not willing to do—drug companies are not—don't have the capacity. And I know we can do this. And I know we can find great breakthroughs.
America does big things. Eleven years ago today, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, historic achievement that would not have been possible but for the vision and determination of one of the most successful Presidents in recent American history: Barack Obama.
I might note, parenthetically, when I got in the automobile to go over to the—to HHS, he was laughing. I didn't know what he was laughing about. And he said: ""Did you hear? They picked up what you said on the mike."" All I could think was, ""Thank God my mother wasn't around to hear it."" [Laughter]
But look, on this anniversary, we should remember just how close we have come to losing that act we so fought so hard for. And we have a duty not just to protect it, but to make it better and keep becoming a nation where health care is a right for all and not a privilege for a few.
When I ran for President, I promised I would build on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act. And just 50 days into my administration, we've delivered on that promise with the American Rescue Plan. It does that by making health care more affordable. It means better coverage and lower premiums for millions of Americans.
If you're enrolled in Obamacare, you're going to save an average of $50 a month—$600 a year—by the reduction of payments. For a family of four earning $90,000 a year, that could save you $200 a month in savings. For a 60-year-old couple here in Ohio earning $75,000 per year, it could save them about $1,000 per month and to maintain this health—same health care. That's $12,000 a year in your pocket that you didn't have before.
Because of the American Rescue Plan, if you lost health care because you lost your job or your hours were cut, we pay your contribution and your employer's contribution under the so-called COBRA. That's what your employer-based health insurance was. And so since—if they've gone out of business or you're no longer there because you had to be laid off, you can stay covered for up to 6 months until you get back on your feet, because, we'll—the Federal Government will cover both ends of that COBRA payment.
For millions who are out of work and have no coverage, thanks to this law, there's an Obamacare plan that most folks can get with zero-dollar premiums. Copays will still be there, but zero-dollar premiums.
Four out of five Americans shopping on the Obamacare marketplace can get quality health care with a premium of $10 a month or less. Let me say that again: Four out of five Americans who shop for a plan will find one for $10 or less per month. It's especially important in communities that historically have gone without insurance at higher rates. Very few communities that have always faced health disparities—Black, Brown, and Asian, Native American communities—have borne the brunt of the COVID crisis.
And we're also making it easy to—easier to sign up for Obamacare. We've opened healthcare.gov for special enrollments on February the 15. In the first 2 weeks alone, more than 200,000 Americans gained coverage. Today I'm pleased to announce that we've extended that period to run through August the 15th. Just go to healthcare.gov or call the national hotline: 1-800-318-2596. That's 1-800-318-2596. A few clicks and a short conversation—that's all it takes to start seeing these benefits of increased coverage and lower premiums. I'll close with this: With the American Rescue Plan and the Affordable Care Act, millions of families will be able to sleep a little more soundly at night because they don't have to worry about losing everything if they get sick.
I, like many of you, grew up in a middle class—I guess, technically, lower middle class—household based on outcome. We lived in a three-bedroom split-level home with four kids and our grandpop living with us. And the paper—the walls were paper-thin. I can remember lying in bed and hearing my dad rolling back and forth, and I could tell there was something wrong. I remember asking my mom the next morning, ""What's the matter with Dad?"" She said: ""Honey, he's just worried. We just lost our health insurance. He no longer has his coverage.""
People lying in bed wondering: ""My God, what happens? What happens if, in fact, I get sick? What happens if I turn and she has breast cancer or I end up with a heart condition? What happens?"" And God forbid you're sitting on the edge of a hospital bed with someone you love—like I did with my son Beau as he was dying, and all you have to think about is—all they have they have to think about is getting better, not what happens if an insurance company can come in, like they did before Obamacare, and say, ""Sorry, you've outrun your coverage."" I used to sit there and think: ""My God, what would happen? What would I do?""
That's the difference. And we're going to keep building until every American has that peace of mind and to show that our Government can fulfill its most essential purpose: to care for and protect the American people. When we work together, we can do big things, important things, necessary things.
We saw it 11 years ago with the Affordable Care Act. We saw it 11 days ago when we marked the signing of the American Rescue Plan. But we're not done yet.
Last week, we met my goal that I announced of administering 100 million shots in my first 100 days in office. At the time, the press said that's awfully ""audacious."" Now that we've done it in 58 days, they're saying, ""Boy, he sure set the bar awful low.""
Well, this week, we're announcing a new goal: to get more people vaccinated. But we need all Americans to keep washing their hands, staying socially distanced, and wearing the mask when you're in public, as recommended by the CDC. And get vaccinated when it's your turn. It's a patriotic responsibility you have.
Now is not the time to let down our guard. If we all do our part, after a long, dark year, we can show once again that we are the United States of America; that there's nothing we have—cannot do if we do it together.
We're going to beat this pandemic. And because of the great docs up this staircase here, we're going to beat cancer as we know it as well. We're going to make sure, once and for all, that health care is a right, not a privilege, in this Nation.
So I want to say to, again, the docs who spent the day with me, all the incredible work you're doing—I told them that when my son contracted stage-four glioblastoma when coming home from Iraq—when he was in Iraq, that I had the opportunity—the President asked me to do what they called a Cancer Moonshoot.
I put together an organization made up of seven Nobel laureates, as well as another 30 docs in the cancer field, and I was able to go and visit every major cancer facility in the world save one. And we have some of the finest minds in the world, and they're right here: right here at Ohio State, right here in Ohio, right here in the United States of America. And they break their necks every single day for us. We owe them.
I want to thank you all. May God bless you, may God bless us all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you for the hospitality.","NOTE: The President spoke at 5:26 p.m. at the Arthur G.

23-Mar-21,"Remarks in an Exchange With Reporters During a Tour of the Radiation Oncology Department of the Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute in Columbus, Ohio","[The President's remarks were joined in progress.]
The President's Involvement With Cancer Research Initiatives/Hazards Faced by Deployed U.S. Servicemembers 
Q. Sir, is it comforting or is it hopeful or more painful for you to hear about cancer developments like this?
The President. It's mostly hopeful, because I don't want to see anybody go through what my son went through.
One of the things you should be aware of: There are probably more soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines coming home with brain cancers than any time in American history because of exposure. Some of you have read about the book ""Burn Pits."" There's a lot of research that still has to be done to determine whether or not exposure to these toxins in the air have had something to do with it. Also, you have an awful lot of these IEDs have caused trauma—brain trauma in other ways as well.
So it really is something that I think is going to encourage us to spend a lot more time in the Government focusing on. A little bit like, you know, what used to have to with Agent Orange: You'd have to prove that, even though you were drenched in it and it rained on you, that whatever your problem was, was a consequence of that. It was very hard to prove. I finally got a bill passed, as a Senator, saying, if you were drenched, you're automatically assumed, whatever your problem is, related to that.
Same thing now with an IED. If you were near a concussion, you have a problem with brain—it's assumed the Government has responsibility for it. And—but there's a lot going on, and the doc could tell you more.
But something that really excites me, Doc, is the idea that we're moving into potential immunotherapy initiatives that—what they did with Beau, they injected an adenovirus into the brain.
Radiation Oncology Department Chair Arnab Chakravarti. Yes. Exactly.
The President. And it—they were—they were giddy, initially, at all of the—the human body coming in to eat up the virus, but it just kept going. And because there had been some damage from radiation on a blood vessel, it—things got—it didn't work.
But there's real hope for people. There's real hope.
Dr. Chakravarti. And, Mr. President, with this FLASH therapy, there's more—much more synergism with immune therapy than with conventional radiation——
The President. Yes, I agree with that.
Dr. Chakravarti. ——we're finding.
The President. Not that I agree. I don't mean like—as if I—matters what I agree on.
Dr. Chakravarti. And our Proton Center, which will be—will treat our first patient 2023—will have FLASH capabilities. So it will combine the benefits of protons, FLASH, and immunotherapy together. So——
The President. Explain the difference between a proton and radiation going to——
Dr. Chakravarti. Yes, great question. Great question.
The President. It's really important.
Dr. Chakravarti. Yes. So with conventional radiation therapy, like this unit right behind you, sir, this produces high-level X-ray energy radiation that's penetrative. It goes through normal tissues as well as tumor. So everything is treated: normal tissues and tumor together.
With proton therapy, the dose stops right at the tumor so you're not treating normal tissues. So it's a major advancement in the treatment of cancers.
The President. And treating normal tissue sometimes is a very bad thing. Just—it also—it can destroy the normal tissue. It can destroy the cancer—hit that—but it goes through the cancer and destroys whatever is beyond it. Not just in the brain, but wherever that is.
And so that's why I think some of the—a few of the Nobel laureates on my cancer facility are—would argue that we should get—we should start to focus on proton.
Dr. Chakravarti. Yes.
The President. And because it doesn't have the same application, but it does less damage when it occurs—when there is damage done.
And—but it really is one of my regrets of becoming President: I had to give up the Biden Cancer Initiative, because I couldn't raise any money for it. But we proposed—there's literally six Nobel laureates on the board. A group of people that are like the Doc. I tried—I almost called you to ask for you—it's a long story but——
Dr. Chakravarti. Yes, yes.
The President. And—but it is something that there's a lot—these guys are on the edge of so many things. Think about it: Jimmy Carter was declared basically gone 5 times. Obviously, he's in trouble now, but it's amazing that—you know, it's a little bit like—it's why you should never give up hope. When the breakthrough comes, it just comes through. Not planned—it's just, ""Whoa, we've got it.""
Dr. Chakravarti. Yes.
The President. Anyway. I'm talking too much.
Gun Control Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, do you believe you have the political capital to make changes on gun measures right now?
The President. I hope so.
Q. Are you——
The President. I don't know. I haven't done any counting yet.

23-Mar-21,"Remarks on the Shooting in Boulder, Colorado, and an Exchange With Reporters","The President. There's still a great deal we don't know about the killer and the motivation of the killer in Boulder, Colorado, and other critical aspects of this mass shooting. I've been briefed this morning by the Attorney General of the United States, the Director of the FBI. I've spoken with the Governor, and I'll be speaking with the mayor on the aircraft.
We're working very closely with the State and local law enforcement officials, and they're going to keep me updated as they learn more. You're going to ask me to speculate—understandably, you'd ask me to speculate—on what happened, why it happened, and I'm not going to do that now because we don't have all the information, not until I have all the facts.
But I do know this: As President, I can use all the resources at my disposal to keep the American people safe. As I said: At this moment, a great deal remains unknown. But three things are certain. First, 10 lives have been lost, and more families have been shattered by gun violence in the State of Colorado. And Jill and I are devastated. And the feeling—I just can't imagine how the families are feeling—the victims whose futures were stolen from them, from their families, from their loved ones who now have to struggle to go on and try to make sense of what's happened.
Less than a week after the horrific murders of eight people and the assault on the AAPI community in Georgia, while the flag was still flying halfstaff for the tragedy, another American city has been scarred by gun violence and the resulting trauma.
And the State that—I even hate to say it because we're saying it so often: My heart goes out. Our hearts go out for the survivors. The—who had to flee for their lives and who hid, terrified, unsure if they would ever see their families again, their friends again. The consequences of all this are deeper than I suspect we know. By that, I mean the mental consequences, a feeling of—anyway, it just—we've been through too many of these.
The second point I want to make is: My deepest thanks to the heroic police and other first responders who acted so quickly to address the situation and keep the members of their community safe. And, to state the obviously—the obvious, I commend the exceptional bravery of Officer Eric Talley. And I send my deepest condolences to his family—his close, close family of seven children.
You know, when he pinned on that badge yesterday morning, he didn't know what the day would bring. I want everybody to think about this: Every time an officer walks out of his or her home and pins that badge on, a family member that they just said goodbye to wonders whether they'll—subconsciously—will they get that call. The call that his wife got.
He thought he'd be coming home to his family and his seven children. But when the moment to act came, Officer Talley did not hesitate in his duty, making the ultimate sacrifice in his effort to save lives. That's a definition of an American hero.
And thirdly, I want to be very clear—this is the one thing I do know enough to say on it, in terms of what's happened there: While we're still waiting for more information regarding the shooter, his motive, the weapons he used—the guns, the magazines, the weapons, and the modifications that apparently have taken place to those weapons that are involved here—I don't need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take commonsense steps that will save the lives in the future and to urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to act. We can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country once again. I got that done when I was a Senator. It passed. It was law for the longest time, and it brought down these mass killings. We should do it again.
We can close the loopholes in our background check system, including the ""Charleston loophole."" That's one of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence. The Senate should immediately pass—let me say it again: The United States Senate—I hope some are listening—should immediately pass the two House-passed bills that close loopholes in the background check system. These are bills that received votes of both Republicans and Democrats in the House. This is not and should not be a partisan issue; this is an American issue. It will save lives—American lives—and we have to act. We should also ban assault weapons in the process.
I'll have much more to say as we learn more, but I wanted to be clear: Those poor folks who died left behind families—that leaves a big hole in their hearts. And—and we can save lives increasing the background checks so that they're supposed to occur and eliminating assault weapons and the size of magazines. We don't know all the detail yet on that. But I'll be talking to you more later today or in the next couple of days about what else we know.
May God bless you all and those families who are mourning today because of gun violence in Colorado and Georgia and all across the country. We have to act so there's not more of you—there's fewer of you—as time goes on.
Thank you so much.

19-Mar-21,"Remarks at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia","Thank you, and good afternoon. Sorry we're a little late, but we had an opportunity to meet with leaders of the AAPI community downstairs, and it was heart wrenching to listen to them.
As many of you know, we originally planned to hold a car rally to thank our supporters. But given the recent days—events of recent days, we didn't feel it was appropriate, so we canceled that rally. But we want our supporters to know we'll come back and hold that rally another trip. But today we want to speak about something else.
I said from the beginning of my campaign for President that we needed to come together; that we needed to unite as one people, one Nation, one America. I said in my kickoff speech in Philadelphia. I said that very same thing when I spoke at Gettysburg. I said that in my inaugural address. And I believe it with every fiber of my being.
There are simply some core values and beliefs that should bring us together as Americans. One of them is standing together against hate, against racism, the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our Nation.
The Vice President and I, as I said, met a little bit earlier, just before this, with leaders from the Asian American community here in Georgia. We talked about Tuesday's mass shooting, about another example of public health crisis, of gun violence in this country. Eight people killed, seven women. Six were of Asian descent. All fellow Americans. Each one of them we mourn.
Their families are left with broken hearts and unanswered questions. And the investigation is ongoing. And the Vice President and I are being regularly updated by the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, working closely with Governor Kemp and Mayor Bottoms and local officials.
But whatever the motivation, we know this: Too many Asian Americans have been walking up and down the streets and worrying, waking up each morning the past year feeling their safety and the safety of their loved ones are at stake. They've been attacked, blamed, scapegoated, and harassed. They've been verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, killed.
Documented incidents against—of hate against Asian Americans have seen a skyrocketing spike over the last year, let alone the ones that happened and never get reported. It's been a year of living in fear for their lives just to walk down the street. Grandparents leave—to leave—afraid to leave their homes. Small-business owners targeted and gunned down. Attacks on some of the most vulnerable people in our Nation: the elderly, low-wage workers, and women.
In fact, Asian American women suffer twice as many incidents of harassment and violence as Asian American men. We're learning again what we've always known: Words have consequences. It's the coronavirus. Full stop.
The conversation we had today with the AAPI leaders—and that we're hearing all across the country—is that hate and violence often hide in plain sight. And it's often met with silence. That's been true throughout our history, but that has to change, because our silence is complicity. We cannot be complicit. We have to speak out. We have to act.
My first week in office, I signed an Executive order directing Federal agencies to combat this resurgence of xenophobia. The Department of Justice is strengthening its partnership with the AAPI community to prevent these crimes, in addition to its other work to take on violent extremists and domestic terrorism.
I'm calling on Congress to pass and get my—to get to my desk the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. And the House just passed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, a law I authored more than 25 years ago and is one of my proudest legislative achievements. I call on the Senate to swiftly pass it and get it to my desk. But for all the good that laws can do, we have to change our hearts. Hate can have no safe harbor in America. It must stop. And it's on all of us—all of us, together—to make it stop.
Something else should bring us together, and that is a belief in science. Science isn't something that should divide us. There's nothing political about it. There's nothing partisan about it. One of America's best examples of commitment to science is headquartered right here in Atlanta: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC represent the best of this Nation: brilliant minds, deep faith in science, and a strong commitment to public service. We came here to thank them for all the work they do and especially the work they've done over the course of this pandemic. We owe them and their families our gratitude.
And we wanted to convey to them the absolute commitment to give them everything they need to do their work and get it done, free of politics and guided by science. And because of them, we're making real progress. We just met my goal of administering 100 million shots before my first 100 days in office. We did it in about 60 days. We're not stopping now.
The American Rescue funds more vaccines, more vaccination centers, and more increases in testing. It's going to help us accelerate our nationwide effort to reopen schools safely.
Last week, I directed all States, Tribes, and Territories to make all adults eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1. But while this is a time of optimism, it's not a time for relaxation. I need all Americans to keep doing your part: wash your hands, stay socially distanced, keep masking up as recommended by the CDC, and get vaccinated when it's your turn.
None of this is political. It's all science-based. But now is not the time to let down our guard down. That's science-based as well.
In the last week, we've seen increases in the number of cases in several States. Things may get worse as new variants of the virus spread. That's why we need to vaccinate as many people as quickly as we possibly can, because it's the best thing we can do to fight back against these variants. We will do—we have to beat this virus. We have to, and we will. But we'll do it by setting aside politics and embracing science.
On another subject, the right to vote, that should bring us together as well, but it now divides us. This is a democracy, and the right to vote is fundamental. The fact that there was a record turnout in America in the last election, in the midst of a pandemic, should be something we celebrated, not attacked.
The fact that you held a free and fair election in Georgia that stood up to recount after recount, court case after court case, is something you should be proud of. The fact that your poll workers, your election workers, your volunteers, your local officials, your State officials, your courts stood up to the immense pressure with character and honesty and integrity helped save our democracy. And this country will long be grateful for it.
But as this State, home to Martin Luther King and John Lewis, knows better than most: The battle for the right to vote is never, ever over. And it's not over here, in this State of Georgia.
So we're in the fight again. It's a fight we need to win. Because if anyone ever doubted that voting matters, Georgia just proved it did. If anyone ever wondered if one vote can make a difference, Georgia just proved it 11,779 times. And if anyone ever wondered if voting can change a country, Georgia just proved it can. Because when you elected two new United States Senators, you made it possible to pass the American Rescue Plan.
Landmark legislation will not only meet the emergency we're in, but transform this Nation—starting with this: For those folks who either already have or will soon have $1,400 in their pockets, you can thank Senators Warnock and Ossoff. But for their votes, it would not have happened.
What does that mean? It means 85 percent of the households in America will get that money. Here in Georgia, it means 88 percent of all adults and 88 percent of the children in this State will get that $1,400 as well. Just add it up. A typical family—two parents, two kids—earning $100,000 a year, each will get $1,400. That's $5,600 for that family that's in distress trying to figure out how to pay their mortgage, pay their rent, keep food on the table.
And that's not all. There's something called a ""child tax credit."" What that basically means is, you get a tax credit for every child you have. The American Rescue Plan expands that credit. It means that families of over 2 million children in Georgia will be eligible for an increase in that child tax credit of [up to]* $1,600 per year—per child. And it's going to be delivered on a regular basis. So, starting this summer, families with young kids will get $300 a month per child. This is going to lift 177,000 [171,000]* children in Georgia out of poverty.
The American Rescue Plan expands coverage and reduces costs under the Affordable Care Act. So for a family of four earning $90,000 per year, with insurance under the Affordable Care Act, they'll see about $200 a month off their monthly premiums.
And for Georgia's schools, the American Rescue Plan provides around $4 billion for Georgia's schoolchildren, from grades K through 12, to help them reopen safely.
And here's one of the biggest things for Georgia: Because of the American Rescue Plan, Georgia is now eligible for about $2 billion to expand Medicaid. What does that mean? It means another 500,000 Georgians will be covered all across this State with Medicaid that don't have it now.
For your State and local governments, this is what it does: State Government will get around $5 billion to make up for lost revenue. Local governments will get around $3.5 billion. That's going to make it possible to keep a lot of police officers, firefighters, teachers, and other first responders on the job.
And here's one final thing the American Rescue Plan does: For the first time in a long time, it puts the working families, the middle class—people who built this country—first, not last. Sixty-six percent of the tax breaks in this plan go to folks making $90,000 or less a year. And how much for the top 1 percent—where 83 percent of all of the tax cut—it was the last President's tax cut? Zero. The top 1 percent get zero.
But the American Rescue Plan isn't only about putting money in the pockets—people's pockets. It also will create and spur economic growth in America. That's why major economists—left, right, and center—support this plan. Even Wall Street agrees. According to Moody's, this law will help America create 7 million new jobs by the end of the year. And we'll do it by rebuilding the backbone of this Nation: the working people, the middle class—the people who built this country.
It's about giving those people a fair shot for a change. It's about providing and proving to the American people that their Government works and can deliver for them, which brings me to my last point. The American Rescue Plan is a plan that brings America together and benefits all America. That's why so many polls show that over 70 percent of the country support it, including Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. Maybe Republicans in Washington didn't vote for it, but the American Rescue Plan sure has brought the country together. And, for me, that measure of unity, that's what matters.
Let me end with this: There's so much we can do if we do it together; if we remember who we are; if we stand together against hate; once again believe and invest in science; if we stand up for the right of all Americans to vote and have access to voting; if we remember we're here to help all the people of this country, not just those few at the top; if we remember to do justice, love mercy, to walk humbly as fellow human beings and as fellow Americans; if we remember we're the United States of America and that, together, there is nothing—not a single thing—we cannot do if we do it together.
My heart goes out to all—all the family members who lost someone in those horrific shootings on Tuesday. I know they feel that—like there's a black hole in their chest they're being sucked into and things will never get better. But our prayers are with you. And I assure you the one you've lost will always be with you. Always be with you. And the day will come when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye, as unbelievable as that is now. It will take a while, but I promise you it will come. And when it does, that's the day you know you're going to make it.
May God bless all those families. May God protect our troops. Thank you very much.","NOTE: The President spoke at 5:45 p.m. in Convocation Hall. In his remarks, he referred to Georgia State Sens.

19-Mar-21,"Remarks During a Briefing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia","The President. You know, one of the things that caught my attention—I think we talked about this very early on, within the first 6 weeks of the virus becoming where it—everybody, and people starting to get sick, and some of them die. And—was I got a call from a mayor, a really great guy, a real hard-working fellow in Detroit, saying to me, ""Mr. President, you don't understand."" This was even before—I wasn't President then, actually. He called me, ""Mr. Vice President."" He said: ""You know, it's—I don't think people understand. You know, my community is now about 80 percent African American. And we're dying and getting sick at a much higher rate than the White community here or any other community.""
And I brought that up, initially, before I put together that group that you're leading and helping lead, and no one wanted to hear it. And I remember they—we had trouble getting your predecessors just to track it. But what you're doing really makes a difference. It makes a gigantic difference. As the Vice President knows as well or better than anybody, it really, really makes a difference. So thank you.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response Chief Health Equity Officer Leandris Liburd. Thank you.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Thank you.
Chief Health Equity Officer Liburd. Dr. Walensky. Thank you so much.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle P. Walensky. Any other questions for us?
The President. No, but why are you all standing? [Laughter]
That's the first one. You don't have to stand for us. Why don't you sit down? For real. Get comfortable.
Vice President Harris. No chair.
The President. No, they have chairs.
Participant. We do it all the time, sir.
The President. They have chairs. [Laughter] But you know, that's the first question.
And the second question is, why did only one person clap? I don't know. [Laughter] They might take that to say—you know what I mean? I'm teasing. I'm teasing.
The reason I do this, as the doc knows—[laughter]—you all are too serious here—we owe you a gigantic debt of gratitude, and we will for a long, long, long time, because I hope this is the beginning of the end of not paying attention to what's going to come again and again and again and again.
We can build all the walls we want. We can have the most powerful armies in the world, we can—but we cannot stop—we cannot stop these viruses, other than be aware of where they are and move quickly on them when we find them.
And the one thing that I—the reason I am so, so happy to have been able to—anyway—to have Doc here is that science is back. No, all kidding aside. Think about it: For the longest time, not just as it relates to CDC, but science was viewed as sort of an appendage to anything else we were talking about. But it's back.
Participant. That's right.
The President. And I just want you to have some confidence that it's not only—are the Vice President and I and the whole team, and the whole COVID team writ large committed, but the American people have moved. The American people have moved. This is a bipartisan effort now. Now, it isn't showing itself in the way Senators and Congressmen vote, but the public—the public. We were talking about it on a helicopter—on the airplane.
Vice President Harris. Yes, yes.
The President. The public in a bipartisan way.
When I came up with this $1.9 billion for this whole COVID—and the economic relief side of it as well—we were told that it could never pass; we'd never get any help. Well, we didn't get any help in the Senate or the House, but you have 55 percent of the Republicans in America supporting it. You have 90-some percent of the Democrats, 80-some—the point is, the public is thankful to you, because it's about science. That's what they understand. They understand.
And we're not going back to the old days. Even if tomorrow the whole administration changed, I think things have—you've changed things. You've changed them in a way that are going to make everybody healthier in this country. And when we have a crisis, you're prepared to meet it, because you speak truth and science to power, and that is the power.
So, to all of the folks listening—I guess you said there's hundreds or if not thousands of people listening.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response Incident Manager Henry Walke. Thousands. Yes.
The President. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
There's an entire generation coming up that is learning from what you've done. I don't just mean learning about how to deal with a virus. Learning about it makes a difference to tell the truth, to follow the science, and just wherever it takes you, and just be honest about it. And that's what you've all done.
So we owe you a debt of gratitude in all the lives you've saved. I carry in my pocket—and the doc knows—on the back of my schedule, I have listed every single day with the exact number of people who have died from COVID the day before. I mean for cumulative. We're at 535,217 dead as of yesterday, last night.
It's got to stop. But you're slowing it. It's stopping.
And it really, really matters. You know, that's more people than have died in all of World War—Americans—all of World War I, World War II, the Vietnam war, and 9/11 combined—combined—in a year. In a year.
And you are the Army. You're the Navy. You're the Marines. You're the Coast Guard. I really mean it. This is a war. And you are the frontline troops. It sounds silly to say it that way. It sounds sort of grand. But think about it.
And finally, we got the vaccines. We got the companies together. And then, they didn't have the wherewithal to be able to produce all the vaccines. So there's a thing called the Defense Production Act. As President, I'm allowed to enforce it. So I had people saying, ""Stop making that, and start making these."" We finally put together—did you ever think you'd see the day—because you've all been involved with medicine—see two major drug companies cooperate for the good of the country? [Laughter] One invents—one comes up with the drug, and the other says, ""Well, we'll manufacture it for you""?
So what you're doing really, really, really matters, not only—and I'll end with this—not only in saving lives, but changing the mindset of the country. Changing the mindset of the country. And it's affected everything, not just affected people's health. It's affected their attitude: the attitude about what we can do as a country.
Everybody thought that I was—I didn't quite understand when I announced that we were going to—we had over 100 million shots in less than—you remember when I said we're going to—my goal was to have 100 million shots in people's arms in the first 100 days as President? And everybody said, ""Oh, that sounds—yes, right."" Now it's, ""He should have been more—have been, you know""—[laughter]. ""Why didn't they say more?"" You know what I mean?
But here's the point: The point is that it is changing the way we look at a whole range of things. And when I announced it, everybody but the Vice President wondered why I also pointed out that we landed a rover on Mars at the same time: Because this is the United States of America, for God's sake. There is nothing, nothing, nothing we cannot do when we do it together. And that's what you're showing everybody.
So I came to say thank you. I really mean it. I have a whole lot of nice notes on here about the science, but—[laughter]—but I came here to say thank you, because you're not only—you're changing the psyche of the country. You're saving lives. You're saving lives. But you're changing the psyche of the country.
And this is, as I said—it's not being—I don't think we're being chauvinistic about our country, but this is—think about it: We're the only country in the world that has, every time we've gone into a crisis, have come out stronger immediately after the crisis than when we went in before the crisis. Think about it. It's about who we are.
Closing comment: I was with Xi Jinping in China. I spent more time with him, I'm told, than any world leader because when he was Vice President, I was Vice President. His President and mine wanted us to get to know one another because it was clear he was going to become the President. And I spent—traveled 17,000 miles with him in China, in the United States, and Asia generally, and met with him, I guess, they tell me, 24, 25 hours alone, just me and an interpreter, and he and an interpreter. And by the way, I handed in all my notes. [Laughter] Minor point.
But all kidding aside, he asked me—we were on the Tibetan Plateau. He asked me and said to me, ""Can you define America for me?"" And I said: ""Yes, in one word. And I mean it—in one word: possibilities."" Possibilities. That's what you guys believe in: possibilities, based on science and hard data.
And so I just thank you for not only your intellectual skills, but your heart—your heart, your determination. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And I shouldn't have done that because I wanted to yield to my Vice President, who's smarter than I am. [Laughter]
Vice President Harris. Well, there's not much to add to that, Mr. President. [Laughter]
The President. Oh, just sorry.
Vice President Harris. No, I—but I will say that I do believe that this administration, with the leadership of our President, is without any question about science. And everyone here knows, before the President was President, he was dedicated to science—the Moonshot, the—and so—and my mother was a scientist. I grew up—the first job I had, little-known fact, was cleaning pipettes at her lab. I was awful. She fired me. [Laughter]
And then, there was this moment of global crisis. And the President takes calls with leaders around the world. We talk with people around the world. And they have named their centers of disease control after this center of disease control. They put their—the name of their country, and they call it ""CDC.""
Participant. That's right.
Vice President Harris. You all are a model for the world around what can be done based on a pursuit of that which will uplift and improve human condition and life. And you guys do this work around the clock.
And so we are here to say thank you, because it's not easy. You're making difficult decisions right now, some of the most difficult, but you're making those decisions based on science, based on hard work, and based on a commitment to the public health. And therein lies part of the nobility of your work. You do this work on behalf of people you will never meet, on behalf of people who will never know your names because you care about our country and their well-being.
So we are here to thank you. Thank you.
The President. Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 2:17 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to Mayor Michael E.

18-Mar-21,Remarks on the 100 Million Shot Goal,"The President. Well, folks, good to see you all.
When I announced in early December that I had goal that I set of administering 100 million shots for the virus in the first 100 days of our office—100 million shots in 100 days—it was considered ambitious. Some even suggested it was somewhat audacious. Experts said that it was a—the plan was, quote, ""definitely aggressive,"" and distribution would have to be ""seamless"" for us to be successful. One headline simply put it, quote, ""It won't be easy."" End of quote. Well, it wasn't.
When I took office—when we took office, there was a lot that had to be done. We needed more vaccines, more vaccinators, more places for people to get vaccinated. And we needed a whole-of-Government approach.
So, I directed Jeff Zients, the coordinator of our COVID-19 response, to put us on a war footing—and I meant that in a literal sense—to get us on track to truly beat this virus.
And I'm proud to announce that tomorrow, 58 days into our administration, we will have met my goal of administering 100 million shots to our fellow Americans.
That's weeks ahead of schedule, and even with the setbacks we faced during the winter storms. And it's another big step on the path to checking the—putting checks in pockets and shots in people's arms.
When we crossed the 50 million doses just 3 weeks ago, I told you that every time we hit the 50 million mark, I'd update you on our progress.
So here is where we are today: Eight weeks ago, only 8 percent of seniors, those most vulnerable to COVID-19, had received a vaccination. Today, 65 percent of people aged 65 or older have received at least one shot, and 36 percent are fully vaccinated. And that's key, because this is a population that represents 80 percent of the well over 500,000 COVID-19 deaths that have occurred in America.
We have nearly doubled the amount of vaccine doses that we distribute to States, tribes, and territories each week. We have gone from 1 million shots a day—that I promised in December, before we were even sworn in—to an average of 2½ million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world significantly.
And here's how we accomplished this: Using the power given to a President under the Defense Production Act, we expedited critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies. We worked with vaccine manufacturers to speed up the delivery of millions more doses and brokered a historic manufacturing partnership between competing companies who put patriotism and public health first.
These steps put us on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult American by the end of May—months—months earlier than anyone expected.
And we stood up or supplied more than 600 community vaccination sites that are administering hundreds of thousands of shots per day. We launched the Federal Pharmacy Program, which has allowed millions of Americans to get a shot at one of 1,000—or, excuse me, one of 14,000 local pharmacies in this country, the same way they get their flu shot.
And for folks who aren't near a pharmacy or mass vaccination center, we've supplied more than 500 mobile clinics, like pop-up sites or vans, meeting people where they are—meeting people where they are.
We've developed nearly—we've deployed nearly 6,000 Federal personnel, including FEMA, Active Duty military, and Department of Health and Human Services to support vaccinations and serve as vaccinators—putting the needle in people's arms.
We're also supplying vaccines to community health centers to reach those who have been the hardest hit—the hardest hit—and suffered the most, especially Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities. This is really important, because we believe that speed and efficiency must be matched with fairness and equity.
Now, when [Vice]* President Harris and I took a virtual tour of a vaccination center in Arizona not long ago, one of the nurses on that tour, injecting people, giving vaccinations, said that each shot was like administering a dose of hope. ""A dose of hope."" That's how she phrased it.
Behind these 100 million shots are millions of lives changed when people receive that dose of hope. Grandparents can hug their grandchildren again. Frontline workers who can show up at their jobs without the same fear they used to have. Teachers—with the confidence to head back into the classroom.
These milestones are significant accomplishments, but we have much more to do. Much more to do. And the American Rescue Plan will help us do it.
In addition to the cash payments it provides to you and your families, it also provides the funds to add vaccinators, to supply more community vaccination—support more community vaccination centers, and increase testing.
It will help us accelerate nationwide efforts to reopen our schools safely. And as I told the Nation last week, I've directed all States, tribes, and territories to make all adults eligible to be vaccinated no later than May the 1st. I'm glad to see that several States are already taking that step to make more and more Americans eligible, even before May 1.
Tomorrow we will hit 100 million doses our administration has administered. But I've always said that's just the floor. We will not stop until we beat this pandemic. Next week, I will announce our next goal to put shots in arms.
This is a time for optimism, but it's not a time for relaxation. I need all Americans—I need all of you to do your part: wash your hands, stay socially distanced, keep masking up as recommended by the CDC, and get vaccinated when it's your turn. Now is not the time to let down our guard.
In the last week, we've seen increases in the number of cases in several States.
Scientists have made clear that things may get worse as new variants of this virus spread. Getting vaccinated is the best thing we can do to fight back against these variants.
While millions of people are vaccinated, we need millions more to be vaccinated. And, again, I need you to get vaccinated when it come—when it's your turn, when you're able to do that. I need your help. I need you to help, not just the country, but your family, your friends, your neighbors. Get them vaccinated as well. If we keep our guard up, stick together, and stick with the science, we can look forward to a Fourth of July that feels a bit more normal, with small groups able to gather for cookouts in backyards, and when we'll be—where we begin to declare our independence on Independence Day from the virus.
Look, together—together we're going to come through this stronger, with renewed faith in each other, in our Government that fulfills its most important function: protecting the American people.
Let me be clear again: wearing this mask in the meantime; making sure you wash your hands; making sure you socially distance and listen to the CDC. We've got to reach the point where we have herd immunity—meaning where we have a vast majority of the American people have been vaccinated—before we can stop wearing these.
So, please, please, don't let what's happening—you see happening in Europe and you see on television. Keep the faith, keep wearing the mask, keep washing your hands, and keep socially distanced. We're going to beat this. We're way ahead of schedule, but we've got a long way to go.
So I just wanted to bring you up to date. And I thank you very much. And may God bless America, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you so much.","NOTE: The President spoke at 3:26 p.m. in the East Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeffery D. Zients.

17-Mar-21,Remarks at a Virtual Irish Community Event,"I'm delighted to see you all. And I can see some familiar faces up there, and thank you for all you've done.
Look, you know, I—we all—I spent a lot of time with the Taoiseach today, and he was pointing out to me that my win for the Presidency was more popular in Ireland than it was in United States. [Laughter] And that's not too far off.
One of the things that happened is that, when I was Vice President, I'd spent a lot—I've been to Ireland many times as chairman of the European Affairs subcommittee. But I'm going back and forth, looking at you guys; I should look straight, I know.
The—but one of the things that happened was I would host—some of you know because you attended them—I'd always host a breakfast for the Taoiseach when I was chairman in the United States Senate. But when I became Vice President——
[At this point, the camera shifted.]
I'd leave that alone, guys. Okay? Tell them not to move that, all right? I'm having troubles here. Okay?
But here's the thing: One of the things that I did, I would host a breakfast for the Taoiseach. And then, I would take him in to meet the President, and then we'd go up to a thing that Tip O'Neill started when he was the Speaker, and host the—on St. Patrick's Day—host the Taoiseach and his delegation. And then, I'd always find some excuse to get to the Irish Embassy.
But toward the end of our term as Vice President, the Taoiseach came in and said, ""Barack, let the boy go back to Ireland."" And I've been to Ireland many times, but he said: ""Let him go back and bring his family and spend some time. He's not ever looked up his relatives.""
So they went and did a genealogy. The Irish Times had done—which I had already known—but had done the genealogy for Barack, as well, to identify his great-great-great-grandfather. And they did one for me as well.
And it's interesting that my great-great-great-grandfather Finnegan left for Ireland from County Louth—and he was a shoemaker—within a week of the time that Barack's grandfather left, and he was a shoemaker. And so when I got to Ireland, they pointed out to me—they had done the genealogy—that the likelihood that, as small as the population was and as close as they lived together, the idea of boarding two ships out Newry within a week of one another—actually 6 days—and then not knowing one another was highly unlikely.
And as they say in parts of Claymont, Delaware, ""Who woulda thunk it"" that two guys getting on what were thought to be coffin ships in 1847, making their way to United States, would produce a President and Vice President of the United States of America? And that's how the trip started.
But one of the things that I learned growing up was that, you know, that old Irish expression, ""May the hinges of our friendship never grow rusty."" Now, the truth of the matter is, of all the joys and honor in my 8 years as Vice President, it was hosting those St. Patrick's Day breakfasts, and the—with the Taoiseach in his visits to Washington. And while our—while, you know, the celebration has been virtual this year, we're able to continue that tradition with the Shamrock ceremony that you probably—I'd explained to you started back with Harry Truman. The Taoiseach would always send a crystal bowl with—full of shamrocks in it. And it was—the Taoiseach would always send his best from, quote, ""the home sod.""
But like many of you, I grew up hearing all these stories about Ireland from my ancestors. And I had a maiden aunt named Aunt Gertie—Gertrude Blewitt. And she was the older sister of my grandmother, Geraldine Blewitt Finnegan, who married my grandpop, Ambrose Finnegan.
And her father was the first Irish Catholic elected to the State Senate in the State of Pennsylvania, in 1907, I believe. And he served there for some time. And the unusual thing was: He was—back in those days, if you lived in Scranton or the coal mining area, and you were Catholic, you didn't get much of an opportunity to go to college. It was not something that was—there wasn't a whole lot of love and affection between the British who owned the mines and the Irish.
And—but my grandfather graduated from—my grandfather, Blewitt—Edward Francis Blewitt—graduated from college and—as a mining engineer. And I—they got—I was—I spoke at Lehigh University, and they showed me a picture of him in his letter sweater of '69—1869.
And so, for the longest time, I'd hear these stories about my grandfather and what he had done and what he hadn't done. And one of the things that I found out was that he—supposedly, I had this—back to my maiden aunt now: She lived with my grandmother and Grandfather Finnegan, and they had five children: four boys and my mom. And she lived in the house with them on North Washington Avenue—which, by the way, they've renamed, after I won to every precinct in Scranton—they renamed ""Joe Biden Way"" in Scranton—[laughter]—which is kind of interesting.
Anyway, what happened was that she did two things better than anybody else. When my dad lost his job, we went to live with my grandpop for a year while he came to Wilmington, Delaware, to get a job and get started again. He came home every weekend and—but I'd always—Aunt Gertie's room was on the third floor, which—half was turned into a nice bedroom.
And I'd always go up in Aunt Gertie's room because she had two things better than anybody else. One is that she was the best backscratcher in the world. And, two, no offense to the Greeks, but she made the best rice pudding in the world. And you go up, and you'd lie with Aunt Gertie when I was 7, 8 years old, and she'd tell these stories about how the British burned down the—[inaudible]—and what they did to the Irish and all the persecution that took place. And she—as if she'd lived through it all. She had never been to Ireland.
And I remember I—when my—I tell the story about the night she said to me: ""It's not your fault. Your father is a good man anyway."" And I never thought my father wasn't a good man. And she went on to tell me: ""It's not your father's fault that he has English blood. It's not his fault."" And so I tell that story a lot.
And my sister Val, who's my—both my keeper and smarter than me—my sister said: ""Joey, stop telling that story. I don't remember that. I don't think it's true. I think your memory is wrong, and the press is going to jump all over you for saying that one of these days."" And so I stopped saying it because I thought: ""Well, maybe she's right. Maybe my memory is not correct.""
And so my mom, when my dad passed away, moved in with me in Wilmington, Delaware, in our home. And when she died, I never had the courage to go through all her boxes of material that I had moved up to the third floor. And when I decided I was going to redo the third floor for my granddaughters, I figured, ""I'd better go through""—this is a year later—""go through the boxes and find out what's in the boxes,"" even though it was very emotionally difficult to do.
And the first box I opened had, on top of it, 112 or -13 pages—typewritten pages—that look like parchment. Literally, if you bent them, they would snap; they'd break. And they were poems my great-grandfather Blewitt—Senator Blewitt had written. And he was a poet. And I—he—first poem on top of everything else was a poem entitled—and I have this all in my office. I should've brought it and showed you. I have these all bound.
And it says—the title of the poem was ""My Mother's Land, Aroon""—A-R-O-O-N. And it started off the following paragraph: ""Oh, how I hate to learn that—how I learned to hate the British at my mother's knee. They bled poor Ireland dry until . . ."" Then, she goes on and on and on. Immediately called my sister to tell her that was the case—what was—that I was—my memory was correct.
But it's amazing the stories you hear when you're growing up if you're Irish, you have Irish grandparents or parents that have some knowledge of the past. My grandfather, Finnegan, was an all-American at Santa Clara, graduated in 1807. He was a newspaper guy. And he was the—Irishman of rectitude. He wouldn't wear funny hats or do crazy things on St. Patrick's Day, but he always talked about Irish history. And he'd talk about how his grandfather would talk about—Owen Finnegan, when he came—about how—what Ireland was like.
So the long story—to make a long story short, I was talking about this with the Taoiseach. And when I went back to Ireland for a 7-day period after—I told you, when Barack said—you know, when the Taoiseach said, ""Let the boy go home,"" I got an opportunity to literally talk to well over 10,000 people in Ireland. Ten thousand people showed up to see me in Mayo, where my great grandfather started the ""Sons of Mayo,"" which still exists in Scranton. And my grandfather, Finnegan, used to talk about County Louth and the Cooley Peninsula and all these things.
And what I found out was much of what they said turned out to be true about the pain and the suffering that people had gone through and about just how strong the connection to the land and, in most cases, from my case, on St. Patrick's Day, to the faith it was.
And so I found that, you know, one of the things that I—the only original quote I'm given credit for these days is my—over the years—is my characterization of the Irish: We're the only people in the world who are nostalgic for the future. The only people in the world who are nostalgic for the future. And it's a fascinating thing.
And what I admire so much about what are our parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great-grandparents did is their courage: their courage and their refusal to give up their optimism.
You know, I used to always quote Irish poets on the floor of the Senate, and people thought I did it because I was Irish. I didn't do it because—I said it because they're the best poets in the world. That's why I did it.
But all kidding aside, one of the poems that I would make the case of—I'm a great fan of Seamus Heaney, who passed away not long ago. I got to talk to him a little bit. He wrote a poem called ""A Cure at Troy.""
And the poem—the stanza in the poem that I think is appropriate for today is, he said:
History [teaches us not to] hope
On [this] side of the grave,
But then, once in a lifetime The longed for tidal wave
Of justice [rises] up
And hope and history rhyme.
I think that's who we are right now as a country. I think we've been through hell. The public has been through hell. People have lost—we've lost over 500,000 Americans—500,000 dead to COVID. Actually, it's about 531,000 to COVID.
People have got to—gotten a chance to see what we've been on the other side of, as an Irish grace, and that is, they've gotten to see the systemic racism that still exists in the country. They've gotten to see how difficult it is for so many people to—and how, in fact, they've observed for the first time—all those people who allowed us to stay healthy and at home, while they were at this—while they were stacking the shelves at the supermarket, driving the ambulance, being the first responders. The people who, in fact, allowed us to stay safe, allowed us to be where we are.
And I just think that there's a new sense of the ability of us to just come out—we're the only nation in the world, I think—and it's part of the Irish of it, not unique to us—but that have always come out of a terrible situation in this country better than when we went into it. Better than we went into it.
We have a chance to reach out, kind of like our—you know, our ancestors did, to reach out and help each other, to reach out and help people who are in trouble. And that's what I've been trying to do since we got elected. And one of the things that is really a consequence to me is—you know, I talked about this with the Taoiseach: We talked about how we can write a new chapter: a new chapter in the enduring friendship between our nations. And about—we started with the renewal of a partnership—the U.S. and Ireland and Northern Ireland—as enhanced—we have an enhanced cancer research and cancer care facility now.
We launched a new partnership between the Poetry Foundation of Chicago and the Poetry Ireland to promote appreciation for poetry in the United States and Ireland. You might have noticed that I'm a fan of those poets.
And they also dropped by Vice President Harris, who was meeting with the Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster, and Deputy Minister O'Neill. That represents Sinn Féin and the Unionists. And they're sitting in the same room at the same table I'm at here.
And I conveyed my continued support for the Good Friday Agreements and political and economic stability in Northern Ireland, which is still shaky. The National Security Council Senior Director of Europe, Amanda Sloat will join us in bit. We're going to provide more update on those meetings.
But the point is that I've often marveled at—that on one island, not much larger than the State of South Carolina, has given so much to America and so much to the world. I think the most precious gift that the Irish immigrant brought to America was the belief that this is a place of possibilities.
I always tell foreign leaders when they ask me, ""Can I define America?""—like President Xi asked me on the Tibetan Plateau—I said, ""Yes, in one word: possibilities."" Possibilities. If not for a belief in possibilities could a descendant of the Blewitts of Mayo County, the Finnegans of Louth sit here as President of the United States of America speaking to you in the White House, designed by an Irishman. An Irishman.
This is a—when you come to visit me, James Hoban designed the White House—an Irishman. The symbol of the nation of where the Irish blood led—bled 15 Ireland—Éire—Ireland-born generals were spilled defending this Nation in the War of Independence. In years since, Irish Americans have fought wars; built our roads, our canals; started up businesses; written our songs; starred in our movies.
Look, yes—you know, we know there's hard history of discrimination. We know hunger and hardship. We also know what's possible when we support each other. We've come together for progress.
The story of the Irish and the Irish Americans is the story of people who have weathered hard times but always come through, spirit intact. We faced hardships in these hard times like our ancestors faced in theirs: the pandemic, hunger, an economy that's not working for so many people.
We dream of a better, fairer, more prosperous America. We recognize that what Yeats wrote, ""In dreams began responsibility."" ""In dreams began responsibility."" Now, I want you to think of all your friendships, your support, and all—taking responsibility to build back the America we seek and we know we could have.
You know, I'll leave you with one additional blessing. My grandfather used to have—his Irish blessing was, ""May those who love us, love us; and those who don't, may God turn their ankles so we know they're coming by their limp."" That's not the one, though, I'd use.
But the one is, ""May your home always be too small to hold your friends."" I hope that in the future we'll be able to get together and put that blessing to the test.
I wish you all the best and a Happy St. Patrick's Day. And I'm going to turn it back to Jen.
But remember, there's not a damn thing—not a damn thing this country can't do when we do it together. And that's the Irish of it. It really is. We can do anything. We've been through a lot as a people. We can do anything we set our minds to.
Thank you all so much. I hope next year we're doing it here at the White House because I'm looking forward to seeing you. Thank you so much.","NOTE: The President spoke at 5:10 p.m. from the White House.

17-Mar-21,Remarks Prior to a Virtual Meeting With Prime Minister Michéal Martin of Ireland,"President Biden. I'm going to make a brief opening statement about a current thing going on in the United States here, and that is the shooting down in Atlanta where eight people were killed and—seven women, six of Asian American background. And I was just, on the telephone, briefed by the Attorney General of the United States and the Director of the FBI. And the investigation is ongoing, and the question of motivation is still to be determined.
But whatever the motivation here, I know that Asian Americans are in very—very concerned because, as you know, I've been speaking about the brutality against Asian Americans for the last couple months, and I think it's a—it is very, very troublesome.
And—but I'm making no connection at this moment for the motivation of what the—of the killer. I'm waiting for an answer from—as the investigation proceeds, from the FBI and from the Justice Department. So—and that's—so I'll have more to say when the investigation is completed.
Now, I want to say Happy St. Patrick's Day to the Taoiseach. [Laughter] It's good to have you on television. But next year, in Washington. Next year, in Washington. For years, as you know, Taoiseach, we celebrated this St. Patrick's Day. I always put on a breakfast at my home, and—at the Vice President's Residence—with leading Irish Americans, your Ambassador, our Ambassador, as well as some of the prelates who were involved with this. And it was always a good time.
Then, we'd go into this very office. You'd sit in the chair over here—the Taoiseach would sit there. And I'd sit where the—my National Security Adviser is sitting, and we'd have a long discussion with the President. And then we'd go up to the United States Capitol, where the Speaker of the House, starting with Tip O'Neill, would put on an event as well. And then I always snuck over to the Irish Embassy later.
I hope we can do that next year. I hope we can do that next year. And in the meantime, I want to thank you for the shamrock bowl. I don't know whether you can see it here, but it's a great tradition, a custom that goes all the way back to Harry Truman, who—I have a bust of Harry Truman over in that corner. I noticed he didn't move to grab any of the shamrocks, but——
And tonight, Taoiseach, I wish you—we hope you'll be able to see it, at least remotely. We're going to light up the White House in green. And we—to celebrate the deep, deep affection that the—we Americans have, particularly Irish Americans have for Ireland and the people of Ireland. And that includes millions of Americans like my great-great-grandfather and my great-grandfather and my grandfather, all of whom were Irish Americans on both sides of the family.
My grandfather, Ambrose Finnegan, who was a great football player—American football—and a newspaper man back at the turn of the 19th—of the 20th century, used to always say when—later when he was much older and I'd walk out of his home, he'd say, ""Joey, remember: The best drop of blood in you is Irish."" [Laughter] I remembered it, I promise you. And—because if I didn't, my grandmother, Geraldine Blewitt Finnegan, would take me down.
And we have a lot of great memories as well in our family because one of your predecessors—I went over. I've been to Ireland many times, but the first time I went to actually go back and look at my roots and meet my family was back when—the last year we were—I was Vice President of the United States. And we went both to Mayo, where the Blewitts are from, and Ballina, the city; and we went to County Louth, where the Finnegans are from. And it was a great, great opportunity for me to show my grandchildren and children and my brother and sister. I joked at the time, but I—after I left, I wondered why the hell we left in the first place. It's beautiful. It's beautiful.
And so, I think, you know, there's a lot of folks here in Ireland—my friends from Ireland would always say the American Irish think they're more Irish than the Irish. But the truth of the matter is that we have a great affection for the country and a great affection for the tradition.
And we have a—Ireland and the United States have a robust agenda that we've got to deal with on the substantive side of this—of these issues, Taoiseach, and—from combating COVID to strengthening global health security, to also discussing our economic cooperation and Ireland's leadership now in the U.N. Security Council, which we're working together. Our U.N. Ambassador is online with us here. And I just welcome the leadership and your partnership.
And you know my view and the view of my predecessor, my—of the Obama-Biden administration on the Good Friday Agreements. We strongly support them; think it's critically important that they be maintained. And the political and economic stability of Northern Ireland is very much in the interest of all our peoples—the people-to-people ties.
And I think the idea that we talked about, about renewing our partnership and the All-Ireland Consortium—Cancer Consortium. The U.S., Ireland, and Northern Ireland—it's a partnership that's—that I think we can learn a lot from one another. It's one of the things that, as President, Taoiseach, I am going to focus heavily on with our National Institute of Health: on dealing with cancer. We've all been victims of it, in terms of our families. We all know what it's like. And we're going to make major investments in NIH and cancer research and development. And I'm looking forward to working together.
As a matter of fact, my relatives in Mayo just dedicated a—my—Laurita, one of my cousins, headed up the hospice effort for cancer—not just cancer, but hospice in Ireland. And they just dedicated a new, significant facility to my son Beau Biden, who died of cancer.
And so, everything between Ireland and the United States runs deep, Taoiseach: our joys, our sorrows, our passion, our drive, and our unrelenting optimism and hope.
One of the few quotes that I've been given credit for of my career was, I said—but I mean it—maybe it's just my family—I said, ""We Irish are the only people who are nostalgic for the future."" [Laughter] And I think we are.
It's a great opportunity for you and I to get to talk a little bit. So I'm looking forward to our conversation, and I'm looking forward to getting deeper into discussion about some of the things that are of great mutual interest to both of us.
But as we used to say in the United States Senate, Taoiseach, ""I yield the floor to you.""
[At this point, Prime Minister Martin spoke via videoconference from Dublin, Ireland.]
Prime Minister Martin. Thank you very much indeed, Mr. President. I'm quite—first of all, again, on behalf of the Irish people, to you I express my condolences to the people of America and, indeed, to the people of Atlanta and the families of those who were killed and injured in the horrible and very shocking shootings yesterday. And our solidarity is with you, particularly with the Asian American community. We stand together against such mindless acts of violence.
But I know, Mr. President, that St. Patrick's Day is very special to you as a proud son of Ireland. Equally, I have to tell you, the people of Ireland are so proud of your election as President of the United States of America. And I can think of no better day for me to have the great pleasure to extend to you their warmest greetings. President Biden. Thank you.
Prime Minister Martin. Beannachtaí na Féile Pádraig dhuit. Happy St. Patrick's Day.
Now, as you said, it seems strange to have to celebrate apart. As you know well, Irish people love to come together to celebrate our heritage and culture with song, with dance, with parades, with poetry, and with pride.
And this year, because of the pandemic, it just simply is impossible. And here in Ireland, people are make—are marking the occasion in their homes, but they will be thinking especially of their loved ones around the world and sending them best thoughts and wishes. And they will do so in the hope that next year will be better, as I do believe it will.
President Biden. It will.
Prime Minister Martin. With each person vaccinated, we move closer to the day when people can meet each other, hug each other, and celebrate again. And I greatly look forward to you being able to visit Ireland as you have done so many times and, as you have said, so memorably before. I also hope it will not be long before I can visit the United States again.
For now, the bowl of shamrock in front of you is a symbol of the undying friendship between our two countries—a symbol of the good times we have shared and the challenges we've endured, always at each other's side.
The green shoots point to the brighter future that I know lies ahead. And building that brighter future will, of course, be part of what we discuss today. The policies of our two governments are very closely aligned on the big challenges the world faces. And I look forward to exploring how we can defeat the COVID-19 virus, working together urgently to increase the supply of vaccine for our own people and for people around the world.
We should share notes on our plans for recovery, getting back the ground lost to the pandemic. Both the United States and Europe have put funds of unprecedented scale in place to support this vital work and to build a sustainable and inclusive future supporting the digital and green agendas, promoting open and fair rules-based trade, delivering greater equality and opportunity.
Mr. President, the world has rightly taken great heart from the steps you have already taken to bring the U.S. back to center stage on global health, on climate, and on human rights.
We want to work with you to promote our shared values and interests in the world, including at the United Nations Security Council, on which we are, as you said, currently serving. We want to work with you on time and action, which becomes ever more urgent as we approach COP26 later this year.
Today I especially want to thank you for your unwavering support for the Good Friday Agreement. It has meant a lot, and it has mattered, including as we negotiated Brexit. With a new trading relationship now in place between the European Union and the United Kingdom and a protocol that protects peace and avoids a hard border on this island, I want to move forward with a positive relationship with the United Kingdom. And that means standing by what has been agreed and working together to make a success of it. And that, in turn, then can help maintain peace and promote greater reconciliation on our shared island, goals that I know you support.
There are so many areas where the Irish and American people are already working together, and we would celebrate some of them here today: a consortium through which our practitioners and researchers would improve their efforts to defeat cancer, that most pernicious disease that I know is very close to your heart in terms of dealing with that; a new initiative to share our poetry and bring it to newer and younger audiences that we will announce today. Mr. President, like you, I am fundamentally an optimist. We have all endured the most difficult year. But alongside the suffering and the loss, we have seen immense compassion, care, and courage, especially from our health workers, our educators, and our volunteers. We have seen the world's best scientists come together to deliver treatments, vaccines, and hope at extraordinary pace. And I say that the same spirit of cooperation now will speed and guide our recovery in the year ahead.
And thank you, Mr. President. I look forward to our discussion.
President Biden. I look forward to it as well. We're going to let the press walk out.","NOTE: The President spoke at 1:20 p.m. from the Oval Office at the White House.

16-Mar-21,"Remarks at Smith Flooring Incorporated in Chester, Pennsylvania","The President. As I said, they—I'm going to turn this down just a little bit.
[At this point, the President pulled down his mask.]
As I said, this is a great outfit. This is a union shop. These are people who work like the devil, and they can make a living wage, a decent wage. But 300,000 Pennsylvanians lost jobs—300,000. And in Delaware County alone—this in 2020—19,000.
And I'm not being solicitous when I say these are two of the finest Congressmen in the United States Congress in terms of getting things done. I really mean it. And you know, the American Rescue Plan is going to do more than just provide for the PPE.
And one of the things that we've done early on—they passed the CARES Act early on. And what we did—what they did was they provided for an Inspector General, an outfit to look over where the money was going to make sure that it was spent properly. And the first thing the President did: he came along; he fired the Inspector General. And we found out that only 40 percent of the people who, in fact, were small businesses got in on the deal. And they got very big businesses getting the lion's share of that money.
So when we wrote this Rescue Plan, they were part of the insisting that we have an Inspector General to make sure the money goes exactly where it's supposed to go. And so we're in a position where it's going to bring immediate relief—$1,400—to 85 percent of the American public. I said yesterday we're going to get 100 million shots in people's arms within the first 60 days of my administration and 100 million checks out—100 million people are going to be getting, not a joke, a check for $1,400, which would change their lives.
And you know so many of the people who have worked—[inaudible]—and gotten themselves laid off or there wasn't work, and you find yourself, you know, it's hard paying the rent, hard paying the childcare, hard paying for much of anything.
So I just think that—I hope that the program that we're having here—we're going to have a tax cut to help retired workers. We're in a situation where we're going to expand the Paycheck Protection Program for the folks who were initially shut out.
Initially, at the very beginning of the Paycheck Protection Program, you'd go to a big bank, they'd say: ""Do you have an account with us? Have you borrowed money from us? Do you have a credit card from us?"" They didn't want to deal with people who were on the short side of things. But you've really made it work. And I think you should be aware: More help is on the way, for real.
Do you have questions for me at all?
Smith Flooring Inc. President Kristin Smith. Well, we don't have any questions, but we did want to say thank you. Thank you for your being who you are. Thank you for helping the small business—small minority business. It means a lot that you're here in Chester. It means a lot that you came to see our business because, you know, although Congresswoman Scanlon and Congresswoman Houlahan, sorry—I know Congresswoman Scanlon a little more. [Laughter] Sorry. But not many people come out and stop here in Chester. And so we're just grateful. We're grateful for the things that you're doing. The President. Every time I got stopped in Chester, I lost. [Laughter] I went to school in Claymont, just across the line, Archmere Academy. And we played up here, and you'd better come prepared to play against Chester. [Laughter]
Mrs. Smith. That's true.
The President. Yes, you always came prepared to play in Chester. So a lot of my buddies are from Chester, for real, the people I grew up with.
And it's—you know, one of the things that we haven't—and we're trying like the devil to make sure to correct is: People who are hardest hit by—and the Congresswoman knows this better than I do—the hardest hit are people in the minority communities. Their—the rate at which they get COVID is significantly higher sometimes in the Latino community, Black community, four times greater, and the death rate is significantly higher.
And in the last place—and that's why we're working so hard—they're working so hard to make sure to get the vaccines in places that are not ordinarily the focus. That's why we put these vaccines in community health centers. That's why we have them in drugstores now. That's why we have mobile units.
But I'm not just saying this because we're here. They have been loud and strong voices getting this done. And it's not like it passed with a hundred votes. You know what I mean? It's—it was close.
And I want to thank you both. And everybody in this county and the next county, in Delaware County, should thank you as well.
So is there anything else we can be doing?
Mrs. Smith. We just want——
The President. How many employees at your peak?
Smith Flooring Inc. Vice President James Smith. At our peak, we're at about 20, 23 people. Our peak is summertime. We do a lot of school work, and so that's when we get our big boost.
The President. Yes.
Mr. Smith. Right now we're about 12: 12 people between people in the office, out in the field.
The President. I think it's going to allow you to bring folks back and increase your business.
Mr. Smith. And it's great that schools got funding, so now the schools are going to do some construction and—[inaudible].
The President. Yes. No, that's good. It's a big deal. It's a big deal.
Well, you both do a heck of a job.
Mrs. Smith. Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 3:30 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to former President Donald J. Trump; and Glenn A. Fine, former Principal Deputy Inspector General, Department of Defense.","Joseph R. Biden, Remarks at Smith Flooring Incorporated in Chester, Pennsylvania Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

15-Mar-21,Remarks on the Implementation of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon. When I signed the American Rescue Plan last week, I said, ""Help is on the way."" This week—and I can report—this isn't just on the way, it's here, sooner than many ever thought possible. Over the next 10 days, we'll reach two goals—two giant goals.
The first is, 100 million shots in people's arms will have been completed within the next 10 days, and 100 million checks in people's pockets in the next 100 [10]* days. Shots in arms and money in pockets—that's important.
The American Rescue Plan is already doing what it was designed to do: make a difference in people's everyday lives. And we're just getting started. By the time all the money is distributed, 85 percent of American households will have gotten a $1,400 rescue checks.
To give more—to give one more example: For the average family of two parents and two children making a combined income of $110,000 a year, that's going to add $5,600 for them—$5,600 they'll get.
And the plan does a lot more. It extends unemployment insurance for the 11 million Americans unemployed and any who will be unemployed in the near term.
It will help hundreds of thousands of small businesses keep their doors open, which makes a gigantic difference in neighborhoods and communities. If you have a drugstore, if you have a beauty shop, a hardware store, it's the center of small communities.
And it gets our schools and—resources they need to open safely. It provides the biggest investment in childcare since World War II. And it provides food and nutrition help for the millions of families to keep them from going hungry, keeping a roof over their heads. And it expands health care coverage and lowers health care costs for so many people.
And it will cut child poverty in half in this country. That's the estimate: Child poverty will be cut in half as a consequence of what's in this recovery act.
And it will generate economic growth for the entire Nation. That's why major economists—left, right, and center—support this plan. Even Wall Street has agreed. According to Moody's, by the end of this year, this law will spur our economy to create 7 million new jobs.
And it does one more thing: It focuses on rebuilding the backbone of this country—working families, the middle class, the people who built this country.
But as I said last week, it's one thing to pass a historic piece of legislation like the American Rescue Plan, and it's quite another to implement it. And the devil is in the details. It requires fastidious oversight to make sure the relief arrives quickly, equitably, and efficiently with no waste or fraud in your bank account, in your mailbox, to the local business in your community, and to your child's school.
Look, I've been here before. When President Obama and I came into office in 2009, he put me in charge of implementing the Recovery Act, which helped us recover and rebuild during the Great Recession. I was authorized to put together a team, including an accountability board with Inspectors General from different agencies that were affected by the act to make sure we got the roughly $800 billion out—out and into the countryside—by the book and quickly, over 18 months.
I talked to literally almost a hundred—over 150 mayors, all Governors except one, constantly going over the granular detail of the implementation of this legislation—that legislation. And the effort put us on a path from crisis to recovery to resurgence.
Accordingly, to the oversight board that these—of Inspectors General—they said we got it done with less than two-tenths of 1 percent waste or fraud. And that's not what the previous administration did though.
When the Congress, last year, passed the CARES Act, the CARES Act—the Congress created a Committee of Inspectors General to make sure every penny of that money was spent as it was directed. But one of the first things the previous administration did was fire the head of the Inspector Generals' Committee. So when Congress passed what was intended to be a small business relief program, it instead became a free-for-all for well-connected companies. And mainstream businesses, from hardware stores to beauty salons, that needed the help most were left behind. Four hundred thousand are now gone. We will not let that happen this time.
I learned from my experience implementing the Recovery Act just how important it is to have someone who can manage all the moving parts with efficiency, speed, and integrity and accountability. That's the sort of management we've seen in our fight against the virus with Jeff Zients, our COVID Response Coordinator.
And today I'm pleased to announce and introduce another gifted manager to coordinate our implementation of the American Rescue Plan: Gene Sperling. Gene will be on the phone with mayors and Governors, red States, blue States. A source of constant communication, a source of guidance and support, and above all, a source of accountability for all of us to get the job.
Gene has been here before. The only person in history to serve as Director of economic—of the National Economic Council twice. He led successful efforts to deliver relief to small businesses and unemployed Americans in the Obama-Biden administration and in the Clinton administration.
I spoke with Gene earlier today, alongside my economic team; he's ready to get to work. In fact, he's already hit the ground running. And together we're going to make sure that the benefits the American Rescue Plan go out quickly and directly to the American people, where they belong.
Let me close with this: Help is here and hope is here in real and tangible ways. We're just days away from 100 million shots in millions—in the arms of millions of Americans. That's the way. That's the way—on the way to get every single American access to the vaccine. One hundred million checks going into the pockets—and/or direct deposits—going into the pockets of Americans, on the way to a million more—millions of more Americans. That's real progress. But we have a lot more to do.
We have to prove to the American people that their Government can deliver for them and do it without waste or fraud: that we can vaccinate the Nation; that we can get our kids safely back in school; that we can get our economy back on track by helping hundreds of thousands of small businesses open and stay open; and that we can give people of this Nation a fighting chance again with relief checks, lower childcare costs, lower health care costs, and so much more. That's our job. That's our responsibility.
And in the process, we'll be growing the economy as well. We're going to have to stay on top of every dollar spent through the American Rescue Plan. And that's what we're going to do. We can do this. We will do this. God bless you all. Help us on the way. And may God protect our troops. Thank you very, very much.
Former President Donald J. Trump/Coronavirus Prevention Efforts 
Q. Should President Donald Trump help promote the vaccine among skeptics, sir, especially those Republicans who say they're not willing to take it?
The President. I'm hearing a lot of reports from serious reporters like you saying that. I discussed it with my team, and they say the thing that has more impact than anything Trump would say to the MAGA folks is what the local doctor, what the local preachers, what the local people in the community say.
So I urge—I urge all local docs and—and ministers and priests and every—to talk about why—why it's important to get it—to get that vaccine, and even after that, until everyone is, in fact, vaccinated, to wear this mask.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

12-Mar-21,Remarks on the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,"Good afternoon. Thank you, Kamala. You know, when I look out over what happened the last 50 days when Jill and I first got a chance to move into this magnificent building behind you, I promised the American people—and I guess this is becoming an overused phrase—that help was on the way.
But today, with the American Rescue Plan now signed into law, we've delivered on that promise. And I don't mean I've delivered; we've delivered. Look out there on all of you. Patty, there would still be people, kids in poverty, were it not for all the work you did all those years.
And I want to say to Bernie: Bernie, stepping up and making the case why this was so transformational made a big difference in how a lot of people voted.
I look out at all of you, House Members as well, who have made the case to the American people why this is so important. I watched my buddy, Jim, down in South Carolina, stand up and talk about how it's going to affect individual people.
I have a—my inclination is to mention every single one of you, because I think I've called most of you and thanked you already for what you did. I even called Pallone. He wasn't there though; he was on the other side of the river. [Laughter] We joke all the time. He's in—he's in New Jersey; I'm in Delaware. I keep reminding him Delaware owns the Delaware River up to the high watermark in New Jersey. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, I want to thank you all. I want to thank, particularly, the Speaker, who, from day one—from the very first day I got the nomination—was supportive in ways that are hard for me to describe.
And you know, I served a long time in the United States Senate, longer than anybody for—still there at the time, other than Pat. If I were still in the Senate, I'd be Senate pro tem because I was 2 years ahead of Pat. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, we've still got a lot of great majority leaders. But I never saw anybody handle such a controversial, consequential piece of legislation that was right on the edge than Chuck Schumer. I owe you, Chuck. You did an incredible job.
And look—and to the Members of the House and Senate, thanks for making this happen. You made it happen. As I said, I served 36 years in the Senate. I know how hard it is to pass major consequential legislation, particularly when we only have such minor, small majorities in both Houses, Steny. You've done an incredible job.
And, Nancy and Chuck, I have to say that I agree with many of the columnists that have commented on this legislation: What you shepherded through the Congress not only meets the moment, it does even more. It's historical, and they call it transformational. And it really is. The bill was supported overwhelmingly by the American people—Democrats, Independents, and Republicans—and had a strong support of Governors and mayors across the country in both parties—red States and blues. Over 430 mayors contacted me, many of them Republicans, supporting the bill.
And here's why: Because what you all did with it and the refinements you made, it directly addressed the emergency in this country, because it focuses on what people need most. Debbie and I often talked about: You've got to tell people in plain, simple, straightforward language what it is you're doing to help. You've got to be able to tell a story, tell the story of what you're about to do and why it matters because it's going to make a difference in the lives of millions of people and in very concrete, specific ways.
This legislation, as everybody has already mentioned, will provide $1,400 in direct payments, which we all promised. Well, that means for a typical family of four—a middle-class family, husband and wife working, making $110,000 a year—that means a $5,600 check they're going to get. Eighty-five percent of the households in America will be getting this money.
And a lot of you know—because of the way you came up like I did and others—what that can mean. Think of the millions of people going to sleep at night, staring at the ceiling, thinking: ""My god, what am I going to do tomorrow? I've lost my health care. I don't have a job. Unemployment runs out. I'm behind on my mortgage. What are we going to do?"" Well, guess what? They're going to be getting quite—that check soon, either by direct deposit or a check from the Treasury.
And they're going to—some are going to get it as early as this weekend. This legislation provides resources needed to open our schools. How many of you have dealt not only in your own home and with your children and grandchildren, if you have them, with how difficult it is, the mental pressure and stress that are on so many families? So many people needing help—if they had access to counseling—because it's caused an enormous, enormous stress.
This legislation extends unemployment insurance by $300 a week until September. It's going to help 11 million Americans who were days from losing that benefit. This legislation includes the biggest investment in childcare since World War II. That's not hyperbole, that's just a fact. It's a fact.
It provides help for small businesses to stay open. And you know, 400,000—so many have had to close because, the first time around, you all worked and did a great piece of work, and the House passed a significant legislation. What's the first thing the last President—he fired the folks who were supposed to watch and make sure it got, in fact, distributed the way it was supposed to. We find out so much of it went to people who didn't need it. You all took care of that.
It extends coverage and lowers health care costs for so many Americans—so many Americans. And it's a big number for people.
It provides for food and nutrition. Because people knew—and you all were out there handing out food like many of us were, but you saw people who were in car lines that were literally miles long. You'd see four lanes of cars that went back for a half a mile each, just to get a box of food. Again, through no fault of their own.
It's going to help people keep a roof over their heads. A half million are—haven't been able to make their mortgage payments, about to be thrown out of their apartments. They have to make up all that they owe. And those mom-and-pop realtors are in real trouble.
It's going to cut job poverty in half with—and you know, I've talked to so many of you. Rosa, you and I've spent so much time on this. But you guys—you, Patty, and others—are the ones that have been leading this for so long, and it's finally coming to fruition. And the American people understand it.
It pays for many of the steps we've taken on—to vaccinate Americans. We're going to be in a position where, because of what you all did in the past, we had the money to go out and literally purchase hundreds of millions of vaccines and then go out and make sure we had enough vaccinators. Vaccine is one thing. To get the vaccine in a vial, out of that vial and into a needle, and a needle into someone's arm, it took tens of thousands of people. And because of you, we were able to mobilize the military. We were able to mobilize FEMA. We were able—I was able, by Executive order, to allow former docs and nurses to come back and be able to engage in this activity.
And one of the things that we said in the beginning that no one thought that I was being straight about was, I said this is going to create—we have to spend this money to make sure we have economic growth, unrelated to how much it's going to help people. Well, guess what? Every single major economist out there—left, right, and center—supported this plan. Even Wall Street agreed. According to Moody's, for example, by the end of this year, this law alone will create 7 million new jobs. Seven million.
And the bill, it does one more thing, which I think is really important: It changes the paradigm. For the first time in a long time, this bill puts working people in this Nation first. It's not hyperbole, it's a fact.
For too long, it's been the folks at the top. They're not bad folks. A significant number of them know they shouldn't be getting the tax breaks they had. But it put the richest Americans first, who benefited the most. And the theory was—we've all heard it, and especially the last 15 years. The theory was: Cut taxes, and those at the top and the benefits they get will trickle down to everyone. Well, you saw what trickle down does. We've known it for a long time. But this is the first time we've been able to, since the Johnson administration and maybe even before that, to begin to change the paradigm.
We've seen time and time again that that trickle down does not work. And by the way, we don't have anything against wealthy people. You've got a great idea, you're going to go out and make millions of dollars, that's fine. I have no problem with that. But guess what? You've got to pay your fair share. You've got to pay some. Because guess what? Folks who are making—living on the edge, they're paying. And so, again, all it's done is make those at the top richer in the past, and everyone else falling behind.
This time, it's time that we build an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out—the middle out. And this bill shows that when you do that, everybody does better. The wealthy do better. Everybody does better across the board.
If that's our foundation, then everything we build upon will be strong—a strong foundation: our competitiveness around the world, the jobs here at home, the health and quality of our lives. That's what the American Rescue Plan represents, and it's all about rebuilding what I've been saying, and Bernie and a lot of others are saying—the backbone of this country. The backbone of this country are hard-working folks. Hard-working folks. Middle class folks. People who built the country. And I might add, I think, unions built the middle class. And it's about creating opportunity and giving people a fair shot. That's really all and everything it's about.
In the coming weeks, Jill and I and Kamala and Doug and our Cabinet, with all of you—Members of Congress—we're going to be traveling the country to speak directly to the American people about how this law is going to make a real difference in their lives and how help is here for them. Almost every single aspect would be significant—would be every—if you took the piece of this bill and broke it into all of the pieces, every one of those pieces standing alone would be viewed as a significant accomplishment. But it's all the work you've done for years to try to get us there.
This law is not the end of our efforts though. I view it as only the beginning. As we—look, one of the things that I've been most worried about, and I think you all have too—especially those of us who've been around for a hundred years, like me—[laughter]—is you've watched people lose confidence in government. Just lose confidence in that we tell the truth. That's why, when I announced, I quoted Franklin Roosevelt. He said, ""I'll give it to you straight from the shoulder."" The American people can handle anything if you tell them the truth. And they really can. Just give it straight from the shoulder. And when we do something right, we're going to make a case for it. And when I make a mistake, I'm going to own up to it and say: ""It was me. I made a mistake.""
And I said last night: This is not over. Conditions can change. We're not finished yet. Conditions can change. The scientists have warned us about new variants of this virus. And the devil is in the details of implementing this legislation.
I know from experience when the President turned to me—like I haven't done to the Vice President yet—and said: ""Take care of it. You take care of implementing the plan."" [Laughter] But she could do it. But I remember being—given the dubious distinction of having to implement a Recovery Act back in—when we came into office, Barack and I. I spent literally 4 or 5 hours a day, for 6 months. I talked to over 160 mayors probably more than two or three times; every Governor, save one, who was looking at—from Alaska to Russia—and making sure that we're in a situation where we talk to everybody. But it takes—the devil is in the details.
It's one thing to pass the American Rescue Plan. It's going to be another thing to implement it. It's going to require fastidious oversight to make sure there's no waste or fraud and the law does what it's designed to do. And I mean it: We have to get this right. Details matter, because we have to continue to build confidence in the American people that their government can function for them and deliver.
So there's a lot of work for all of us left to do, but I know we'll do it. To every American watching: Help is here, and we will not stop working for you. Together, with you, we are showing it's possible to get big, important things done. That's what America does. It tackles hard problems. And how we do—you know, look, it's how we do have it within ourselves to come out of this moment, which we've been saying—a lot of us have been saying for a long time, more prosperous, more united, and stronger than we went in. That's where we have a chance to be. That's what we're going to be able to do.
And it's really critical—and it's really critical—to demonstrate not Democrat/Republican; it's critical to demonstrate that government can function—can function and deliver prosperity, security, and opportunity for the people in this country.
And as my grandfather used to kiddingly say, ""With the grace of God, the good will of the neighbors, and the creek not rising,"" that's exactly what we're going to do.
God bless you all. Thanks for all you did. And may God protect our troops. Thank you.
I wish I could come out and shake hands with every one of you. But next time, it won't be so far apart. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Hello, everyone. I wish we were able to do this in person, but it's wonderful to gather with friends even—even in this virtual format. We're reminded that we're in the midst of a global crisis, but we're going to overcome that as well.
The Quad group is—was created in the wake of, as you just—everyone just saw on that short film—in the wake of a crisis under my predecessor George W. Bush, on the two-oh-four—the 2004 tsunami. I remember later, Mr. Prime Minister, in Japan, going and visiting that—the aftermath of that. It was devastating what you all went through.
And for the first time, we're convening this group as—at a leader level. And I want to thank my counterparts for joining me today: Prime Minister Morrison and Modi and Suga. You—it's good to have you all. Like I said, I wish we were doing this together.
The—it's also the first multilateral summit that I've had the opportunity to host as President. And on this—and on this moment, it's a purpose that I think we all are concerned about: a free and open Indo-Pacific is essential to each of our futures, our countries.
The United States is committed to working with you, our partners, and all our allies in the region to achieve stability. And this is a group of—particularly important because it's dedicated to the practical solutions and concrete results.
And, my counterparts, if you'll forgive me, I'd like to give one example of why it matters. There are many examples, but yesterday I signed into law the American Rescue Plan to get the American people through this pandemic and kick start our economy and our economic recovery. It's a bill that will get meaningful help into the hands of people in our country who need it the most.
Consequently, this week, the OECD revised up its expected rate of growth for the United States this year as a consequence of that legislation. In fact, it doubled it from 3.2 percent to 6.5 percent; the fastest rate in 1-year economic growth since 1984. And it's critical because the OECD also predicted that the United States economic growth, fueled by the ARP and increased vaccinations, will be a key driver in global growth this year and our trade partners benefiting around the world as a consequence.
But to get this right, we all have to focus on generating domestic demand and driving sustainable global growth. And we've—launching an ambitious new joint partnership that is going to boost vaccine manufacturing, and—for the global benefit—and strengthen vaccinations to benefit the entire Indo-Pacific.
We're establishing a new mechanism to enhance our cooperation and raise our mutual ambitions as we address accelerating climate change. And we're renewing our commitment to ensure that our region is governed by international law, committed to upholding universal values, and free from coercion.
We've got a big agenda ahead of us, gentlemen, as you well know, but I'm optimistic about our prospects. The Quad is going to be a vital arena for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. And I look forward to working closely with all of you in the coming years. And now, Prime Minister Modi, I'm kicking it over to you. And again, it's great to see you.
[At this point, Prime Minister Modi spoke via videoconference from New Delhi, India.]
Prime Minister Modi. Your Excellencies President Biden, Prime Minister Morrison, and Prime Minister Suga: It is good to be among the friends. I thank President Biden for this initiative.
Excellencies, we are united by our democratic values and our commitment to a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific. Our agenda today—covering areas like vaccines, climate change, and emerging technologies—make the Quad a force for global good.
I see this positive vision as an extension of India's ancient philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which regards the world as one family. We will work together, closer than ever before, for advancing our shared values and promoting a secure, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.
Today's summit meeting shows that Quad has come of age. It will now remain an important pillar of stability in the region. Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken. Prime Minister Morrison.
[Prime Minister Morrison spoke via videoconference from Sidney, Australia.]
Prime Minister Morrison. President Biden, for this wonderful initiative and bringing us together. And my fellow Prime Ministers, it's great to see you. Namaste. Good morning. Konnichiwa. And from Australia, g'day.
As we begin a new day here in Australia, it's not yet dawn. But we join together as Quad leaders of nations to welcome what I think will be a new dawn in the Indo-Pacific through our gathering.
History teaches us that when nations engage together in a partnership of strategic trust, of common hope, and shared values, much can be achieved. When the world emerged from the Great War and our last global pandemic a century ago, it soon found a Great Depression and another global conflict that unleashed a poverty and a devastation that was unthinkable.
As we emerge from this global pandemic and the global recession, let us together create a different future. It is the Indo-Pacific that will now shape the destiny of our world in the 21st century.
As four leaders of great, liberal democracies in the Indo-Pacific, let our partnership be the enabler of peace, stability, and prosperity, and to do so inclusively with the many nations of our region to share in their vision, as expressed through ASEAN, for an open, inclusive, and resilient Indo-Pacific; to respect and support their sovereignty, independence, and security by upholding our values and supporting international law; and to address the many challenges we face, from COVID to climate change.
Know, friends, that Australia, while looking to our friends in all of these tasks, we never leave it to our friends. We'll do our share of the heavy lifting to lighten the burden for us all.
I'm delighted to now hand over to my good friend Yoshi, Prime Minister Suga.
[Prime Minister Suga spoke via videoconference from Tokyo, Japan.]
Prime Minister Suga. Joe, Mr. Modi, and ScoMo: It is a great honor to realize the Japan-Australia-India-U.S. leaders' summit with all of you, working together to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific. Starting with the response to the tsunami disaster that we just saw on the video, the Quad four countries transformed into a forum for diplomatic dialogue in 2007.
Since then, after overcoming some difficult circumstances from around 2017, we gained a fresh momentum. In October, last year, we reached the stage of holding the Foreign Ministers meeting here in Tokyo. Less than half a year since then, we are now holding this first leaders' summit. And I do feel emotional about the development. I thank Joe for your initiative.
With the four countries working together, I wish to firmly advance our cooperation to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific and to make visible and tangible contribution to the peace, stability, and prosperity of the region, including overcoming COVID-19.
Yesterday was the 10th anniversary of the Great East Japan Earthquake. We received massive support from the U.S., Australia, and India in our response to the disaster. Joe visited the affected areas soon after the disaster. And I thank you once again.
I look forward to a fruitful discussion today.","NOTE: The President spoke at 8:32 a.m. from the State Dining Room at the White House.

Biden, Remarks With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue Leaders Virtual Summit Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/348718 ",,,,,,,,,,,
11-Mar-21,Address to the Nation on the First Anniversary of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The President. Good evening, my fellow Americans.
Tonight I'd like to talk to you about where we are as we mark 1 year since everything stopped because of this pandemic. A year ago, we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked. Denials for days, weeks, then months that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness.
Photos and videos from 2019 feel like they were taken in another era. The last vacation. The last birthday with friends. The last holiday with the extended family. While it was different for everyone, we all lost something. A collective suffering. A collective sacrifice. A year filled with the loss of life and the loss of living for all of us.
But, in the loss, we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect, and gratitude. Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do. In fact, it may be the most American thing we do. And that's what we've done.
We've seen frontline and essential workers risking their lives—sometimes losing them—to save and help others. Researchers and scientists racing for a vaccine. And so many of you, as Hemingway wrote, being strong in all the broken places. I know it's been hard. I truly know.
As I've told you before, I carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans who have died from COVID to date. It's on the back of my schedule. As of now, total deaths in America: 527,726. That's more deaths than in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam war, and 9/11 combined. They were husbands, wives, sons and daughters, grandparents, friends, neighbors—young and old. They leave behind loved ones unable to truly grieve or to heal, even to have a funeral.
But I'm also thinking about everyone else who lost this past year to natural causes, by cruel fate of accident or other disease. They, too, died alone. They, too, leave behind loved ones who are hurting badly.
You know, you've often heard me say before, I talk about the longest walk any parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to his child's bedroom to say: ""I'm sorry, but I lost my job. Can't be here anymore."" Like my dad told me when he lost his job in Scranton.
So many of you have had to make that same walk this past year. You lost your job. You closed your business. Facing eviction, homelessness, hunger, a loss of control, and maybe worst of all, a loss of hope.
Watching a generation of children who may be set back up to a year or more—because they've not been in school—because of their loss of learning.
It's the details of life that matter most, and we've missed those details, the big details and small moments: weddings, birthdays, graduations—all the things that needed to happen, but didn't. The first date. The family reunions. The Sunday night rituals. It's all has exacted a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us. For we are fundamentally a people who want to be with others: to talk, to laugh, to hug, to hold one another.
But this virus has kept us apart. Grandparents haven't seen their children or grandchildren. Parents haven't seen their kids. Kids haven't seen their friends. The things we used to do that always filled us with joy have become the things we couldn't do and broke our hearts. Too often, we've turned against one another. A mask—the easiest thing to do to save lives—sometimes, it divides us. States pitted against one other instead of working with each other.
Vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans, who have been attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated. At this very moment, so many of them—our fellow Americans—they're on the frontlines of this pandemic, trying to save lives, and still—still—they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It's wrong, it's un-American, and it must stop.
Look, we know what we need to do to beat this virus: Tell the truth. Follow the scientists and the science. Work together. Put trust and faith in our Government to fulfill its most important function, which is protecting the American people—no function more important.
We need to remember, the Government isn't some foreign force in a distant Capital. No, it's us. All of us. ""We the People."" For you and I, that America thrives when we give our hearts, when we turn our hands to common purpose. And right now, my friends, we are doing just that. And I have to say, as your President, I am grateful to you.
Last summer, I was in Philadelphia, and I met a small-business owner—a woman. I asked her—I said, ""What do you need most?"" I'll never forget what she said to me. She said—looking me in the eye, she said: ""I just want the truth. The truth. Just tell me the truth."" Think of that. My fellow Americans, you're owed nothing less than the truth.
And for all of you asking when things will get back to normal, here is the truth: The only way to get our lives back, to get our economy back on track is to beat the virus. You've been hearing me say that for—while I was running and the last 50 days I've been President. But this is one of the most complex operations we've ever undertaken as a nation in a long time.
That's why I'm using every power I have as President of the United States to put us on a war footing to get the job done. It sounds like hyperbole, but I mean it: a war footing. And thank God we're making some real progress now.
In my first full day in office, I outlined for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic. And we've spent every day since attempting to carry it out. Two months ago, the country—this country didn't have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or anywhere near all of the American public. But soon we will.
We've been working with the vaccine manufacturers—Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson—to manufacture and purchase hundreds of millions of doses of these three safe, effective vaccines. And now, at the direction and with the assistance of my administration, Johnson and Johnson is working together with a competitor, Merck, to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which is one shot.
In fact, just yesterday I announced—and I met with the CEOs of both companies—I announced our plan to buy an additional 100 million doses of Johnson and Johnson vaccines. These two companies—competitors—have come together for the good of the Nation, and they should be applauded for it.
It's truly a national effort, just like we saw during World War II. Now, because of all the work we've done, we'll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in America by the end of May. That's months ahead of schedule. And we're mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccine in one's arm. Calling on Active Duty military, FEMA, retired doctors and nurses, administrators, and those to administer the shots.
And we've been creating more places to get the shots. We've made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one—any one of nearly 10,000 pharmacies across the country, just like you get your flu shot. And we're also working with Governors and mayors, in red States and blue States, to set up and support nearly 600 federally supported vaccination centers that administers hundreds of thousands of shots per day. You can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot, get your shot, never leave your car, and drive home in less than an hour.
We've been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers all across America, located in underserved areas. And we've been deploying—and we will deploy more—mobile vehicles and pop-up clinics to meet you where you live so those who are least able to get the vaccine are able to get it.
We continue to work on making at-home testing available. And we've been focused on serving people in the hardest hit communities of this pandemic: Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities.
So what does all this add up to? When I took office 50 days ago, only 8 percent of Americans after months—only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 have gotten their first vaccination. Today, that number is [nearly]* 65 percent. Just 14 percent of Americans over the age 75, 50 days ago, had gotten their first shot. Today, that number is well over 70 percent.
With new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—that came out on Monday, it means simply this: Millions and millions of grandparents who went months without being able to hug their grandkids can now do so. And the more people who are fully vaccinated, the CD [CDC]* will continue to provide guidance on what you can do in the workplace, places of worship, with your friends, and as well as travel.
When I came into office, you may recall, I set a goal that many of you said was, kind of, way over the top. I said I intended to get a hundred million shots in people's arms in my first hundred days in office. Tonight I can say we are not only going to meet that goal, we're going to beat that goal. Because we're actually on track to reach this goal of a hundred million shots in arms on my 60th day in office. No other country in the world has done this. None.
Now I want to talk about the next steps we're thinking about. First, tonight I'm announcing that I will direct all States, Tribes, and Territories to make all adults—people 18 and over—eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1. Let me say that again: All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1. That's much earlier than expected.
Let me be clear: That doesn't mean everyone's going to have that shot immediately, but it means you'll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot.
And, to do this, we're going to go from a million shots a day that I promised in December, before I was sworn in, to maintaining—beating our current pace of 2 million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world.
Secondly, at the time when every adult is eligible in May, we will launch, with our partners, new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot, including a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you. No more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones.
Thirdly, with the passage of the American Rescue Plan—and I thank again the House and Senate for passing it—and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff, including bus drivers, we can accelerate the massive, nationwide effort to reopen our schools safely and meet my goal, that I stated at the same time about a hundred million shots, of opening the majority of K-through-8 schools in my first hundred days in office. This is going to be the number-one priority of my new Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona.
Fourth, in the coming weeks, we will issue further guidance on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated, to lessen the confusion, to keep people safe, and encourage more people to get vaccinated.
And finally, fifth, and maybe most importantly: I promise I will do everything in my power, I will not relent until we beat this virus, but I need you, the American people. I need you. I need every American to do their part. And that's not hyperbole. I need you.
I need you to get vaccinated when it's your turn and when you can find an opportunity and to help your family and friends and neighbors get vaccinated as well.
Because here's the point: If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th, there's a good chance you, your families, and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbeque and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn't mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together.
After this long hard year, that will make this Independence Day something truly special, where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus.
But to get there, we can't let our guard down. This fight is far from order—from over. As I told the woman in Pennsylvania, ""I will tell you the truth."" A July 4 with your loved ones is the goal. But a goal—a lot can happen; conditions can change.
The scientists have made clear that things may get worse again as new variants of the virus spread. And we've got work to do to ensure everyone has confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccines.
So my message to you is this: Listen to Dr. Fauci, one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world. He's assured us the vaccines are safe. They underwent rigorous scientific review. I know they're safe. Vice President Harris and I know they're safe. That's why we got the vaccine publicly in front of cameras so—for the world to see, so you could see us do it. The First Lady and the Second Gentleman also got vaccinated.
Talk to your family, your friends, your neighbors—the people you know best who've gotten the vaccine. We need everyone to get vaccinated. We need everyone to keep washing their hands, stay socially distanced, and keep wearing the masks as recommended by the CDC.
Because even if we devote every resource we have, beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity. And national unity isn't just how politics and politicians vote in Washington or what the loudest voices say on cable or online. Unity is what we do together as fellow Americans. Because if we don't stay vigilant and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track. And, please, we don't want to do again.
We've made so much progress. This is not the time to let up. Just as we are emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules.
I'll close with this. We've lost so much over the last year. We've lost family and friends. We've lost businesses and dreams we spent years building. We've lost time, time with each other.
And our children have lost so much time with their friends, time with their schools. No graduation ceremonies this spring. No graduations from college, high school, moving-up ceremonies. You know, and there's something else we lost. We lost faith in whether our Government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the American people.
But as I stand here tonight, we're proving once again something I have said time and time again until they're probably tired of hearing me say it. I say it foreign leaders and domestic alike: It's never, ever a good bet to bet against the American people. America is coming back.
The development, manufacture, and distribution of the vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science. It is one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished. And we also just saw the Perseverance rover land on Mars. Stunning images of our dreams that are now a reality. Another example of the extraordinary American ingenuity, commitment, and belief in science and one another.
And today I signed into law the American Rescue Plan, an historic piece of legislation that delivers immediate relief to millions of people. It includes $1,400 in direct rescue checks—payments. That means a typical family of four earning about $110,000 will get checks for $5,600 deposited if they have direct deposit or in a check—a Treasury check.
It extends unemployment benefits. It helps small businesses. It lowers health care premiums for many. It provides food and nutrition, keeps families in their homes. And it will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts. And it funds all the steps I've just described to beat the virus and create millions of jobs.
In the coming weeks and months, I'll be traveling, along with the First Lady, the Vice President, the Second Gentleman, and members of my Cabinet, to speak directly to you, to tell you the truth about how the American Rescue Plan meets the moment. And if it fails at any place, I will acknowledge that it failed. But it will not.
About how after a long, dark years—1 whole year—there is hope and light of better days ahead. If we all do our part, this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school, and we'll have proven once again that this country can do anything—hard things, big things, important things.
Over a year ago, no one could have imagined what we were about to go through, but now we're coming through it, and it's a shared experience that binds us together as a Nation. We are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by. But we're also bound together by the hope and the possibilities of the days in front of us.
My fervent prayer for our country is that, after all we have been through, we'll come together as one people, one Nation, one America. I believe we can, and we will. We're seizing this moment. And history, I believe, will record: We faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this Nation's history, darkest we've ever known.
I promise you, we'll come out stronger, with a renewed faith in ourselves, a renewed commitment to one another, to our communities, and to our country. This is the United States of America, and there is nothing—nothing—from the bottom of my heart, I believe this—there is nothing we can't do when we do it together.
So God bless you all. And please, God, give solace to all those people who lost someone. And may God protect our troops.
Thank you for taking the time to listen. I look forward to seeing you.

11-Mar-21,Remarks on Signing the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,"Thank you for coming in. In the weeks that this bill has been discussed and debated, it's clear that an overwhelming percentage of the American people—Democrats, Independents, our Republican friends—have made it clear—the people out there made it clear they strongly support the American Rescue Plan.
Yesterday, with the final passage of the plan in the House of Representatives, their voices were heard and reflected in everything we have in this bill. And I believe this is—and most people, I think, do as well—this historic legislation is about rebuilding the backbone of this country and giving people in this Nation—working people and middle class folks, the people who built the country—a fighting chance. That's what the essence of it is.
And I'm going to have a lot more to say about that tonight and in the next couple of days, and be able to take your questions. But in the meantime, what I'm going to do is sign this bill and make the presentation tonight. And then, there's going to be plenty of opportunities where we're going to be on the road, not only talking about—what I'm talking about tonight is the impact on the virus and how we're going to end this pandemic. And we're going to talk all the elements of the bill, beginning Friday and Saturday and through the week.
So thank you for being here.

H.R. 1319, approved March 11, was assigned Public Law No. 117-2.","Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on Signing the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

10-Mar-21,Remarks Announcing a Collaboration Agreement by Johnson and Johnson and Merck and Company on COVID-19 Vaccine Production and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. I want to thank you both for those words. You know, you and I knew one another when I wasn't a President and you weren't a chairman.
Merck and Co., Inc., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth C. Frazier. Right. [Laughter]
The President. We'd ride back and forth on Amtrak. You lived in Philadelphia; I was commuting to Wilmington. It's good to see you both here. And thank both of you for your kind words.
And I want to thank the scientists and researchers at Johnson and Johnson for the literal heroic effort that began when COVID-19 first spread and led to the safe and effective vaccine that are now being coproduced.
Today we're seeing two health companies—competitors—each with over 130 years of experience, coming together to help write a more hopeful chapter in our battle against COVID-19. I just had an opportunity to meet with both of these CEOs and with their senior operating officers and to hear about the work they're doing together to produce vaccine substitute [substance]* and accelerate what they call to take it to full finish [fill finish]*.
You know, what's clear is, this is a historic, nearly unprecedented collaboration. During World War II, one of the country's slogans was ""We are all in this together."" ""We are all in this together."" And companies took that slogan to heart. For example, one automaker didn't have the capacity to build enough jeeps; a competitor stepped in to help. Competing airline makers teamed up, and they produced parts for each other and gave the American pilots, as a consequence of that, control of the skies.
Today we're seeing the same type of collaboration when it comes to getting this virus under control. I said we ought to treat this like a war. So I want to thank the two companies for showing how we can come together to defeat this virus by putting patriotism and public health first. And I mean that literally, putting patriotism and public health first.
Your companies have been working closely with a man you've both privately, on the way over, bragged about: Jeff Zients. Jeff is in the front row here. I want to thank you, Jeff, and the entire COVID team you put together for the coordination of our COVID-19 response; and Dr. David Kessler and his team at the Department of Health and Human Services.
You know, when we came into office, we began working with the team at J&J to accelerate and add capacity to their manufacturing and production efforts. And it quickly became clear that Merck—one of the world's leading vaccine manufacturers—was in a position to be the partner we needed in this effort—in this wartime effort.
I've not hesitated to use my power under the Defense Production Act to expedite critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies. And it's not just Johnson and Johnson and Merck; Pfizer, Moderna also worked closely with us to help speed up the delivery of millions of more doses.
The result is that we're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every American adult by the end of May, months earlier than anyone expected. And today I am directing Jeff and my HHS team to produce another 100 million doses and purchase another 100 million doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I'm doing this because, in this wartime efforts, we need maximum flexibility. There is always a chance that we'll encounter unexpected challenges or we'll—there will be a new need for a vaccine effort—or vaccination effort.
A lot can happen, a lot can change, and we need to be prepared. And of course, we need to match the miracle of science and the skill of manufacturing with the massive logistical undertaking of vaccinating over 300 million Americans. Already, we have gone from Johnson and Johnson vaccine authorization to shots in the arm in 3 days.
I was telling the gentlemen, we were at a facility yesterday—a veterans outreach—and there were four—or there were three members of the veterans community getting shots. One was getting—of each of the three vaccines. And the guy in the middle, a veteran, was getting his. And I was standing about as far away as I am from you and standing up, and he was sitting down. And as the nurse put it in his arm, he went, ""J&J, just one."" [Laughter] Well, there's millions of people who are going to feel that way and be proud to have—be in a position that they have—an ability to get the kind of help they need.
Seven weeks ago, only 8 percent of the seniors—those most vulnerable to COVID-19—had received the vaccination. Today, 60 percent of the people over the age of 65 or older have received at least one shot. And that's because this is the population that represents 80 percent of the COVID-19 deaths.
We've opened support and opened—excuse me—and supported more than 500 community vaccination sites. That's more—and they're administrating hundreds of thousands of shots a day.
And for folks who aren't near a pharmacy or mass vaccination center, we're deploying mobile clinics, like vans, that go into places to meet the folks where they live. We're also supplying vaccines to community health centers to reach those who have been hit the hardest and suffered the most, especially Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities. And this is important because we know we have more to do to ensure everyone is treated with equity and those most impacted get the care they deserve.
On Saturday, we hit a record of 2.9 million vaccinations in 1 day in America. And beyond the numbers are the stories: a father who says he no longer fears for his daughter when she leaves to go to work at the hospital; the children who are now able to hug their grandparents. The vaccines bring hope and healing in so many ways.
Again, a vaccinated American is the only way to beat the pandemic, get our economy back on track, and for us to get back our lives and our loved ones. You know, that's why the American Rescue Plan was so critical. I want to thank Speaker Pelosi and the House of Representatives today for passing the bill, and I will be signing it into law shortly. This bill represents a historic—a historic—victory for the American people. And I look forward to signing it later this week.
Everything in the American Rescue Plan addresses a real need, including investments to fund our entire vaccination effort: more vaccines, more vaccinators, and more vaccinations sites. Millions more Americans will get tested, including home testing. Schools will soon have the funding and resources to reopen safely—a national imperative.
The American Rescue Plan, the partnership between Johnson and Johnson and Merck, proves we can do big things, important things in this country. Now, I'll—let me conclude with this: Tomorrow night I'm going on primetime to address the American people and talk about what we went through as a Nation this past year. But more importantly, I'm going to talk about what comes next. I'm going to launch the next phase of the COVID response and explain what we will do as a Government and what we will ask of the American people.
There is light at the end of this dark tunnel of the past year, but we cannot let our guard down now or assume that victory is inevitable. Together, we're going to get through this pandemic and usher in a healthier and more hopeful future. So there is real reason for hope, folks. There's real reason for hope, I promise you.
May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God ease the pain in the heart of so many who have lost so many people in this pandemic.
Thank you, and I really—we're going to do this. We're going to get it done. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, what do you plan to do with the surplus? What will you do with the surplus?
National Supply of COVID-19 Vaccine Doses/International Cooperation Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, when will you do a press conference?
The President. The surplus will—if we have a surplus, we're going to share it with the rest of the world. We've already decided we're going to work with the outfit COVAX—we've committed $4 billion to help get the funding for more vaccines around the world. This is not something that can be stopped by a fence, no matter how high you build a fence or a wall. So we're not going to be ultimately safe until the world is safe. And so we're going to start making sure Americans are taken care of first, but we're then going to try and help the rest of the world. Thank you.

9-Mar-21,Remarks During a Tour of W.S. Jenks and Son,"W.S. Jenks and Son co-owner Michael Siegel. So this is our main showroom in the store. You can see a lot of our employees up top there.
The President. Hey, everybody. How are you?
Participants. Hi!
The President. It's good to see you.
Mr. Siegel. We are DC's oldest hardware store. We've been continuously operating in this city since 1866. We've moved around a few times. We've been in this building for 7 years now. Like my father was telling you, this is actually our second Presidential visit, but our first one in this building. So welcome. We're excited to have you here today.
And we want to introduce you to Mary Ackley, from Little Wild Things. She has a separate business in our building. What they do is microgreens. And I'll turn it over to Mary because she can describe her business a lot better than I'll be able to.
The President. Fire away, Mary.
Little Wild Things Farm Founder and Chief Veggie Officer Mary Anna Ackley. [Laughter] Sure. We moved here a few years ago, and we are an urban vertical farm located right next door. We grow salad greens, microgreens, and edible flowers. Beautiful salads. We deliver them all over the greater Washington, DC, area, both to homes, and we donate locally here in the neighborhood.
The President. Now, you've been engaged in the neighborhood too. You sponsor a Little League team, don't you?
Mr. Siegel. We do. We sponsor a Little League team. We also—we run job fairs for special needs programs to get their students—to help them find employment. We've actually hired three people from those—from that job program. It's called ""Project SEARCH."" It's a partnership between a nonprofit and the DC government, and they do a great job training their students, who are special needs, to come and be able to work in an environment like this and be great contributors.
The President. Have you hired any of those folks?
Mr. Siegel. We've hired three.
The President. Three?
Mr. Siegel. Yes.
The President. I'll be darned.
Mr. Siegel. And Mary participated in our first job fair. We were going to do another one, but obviously, the pandemic has halted our ability to do that. But when things go back to normal, we're going to continue to do those job fairs.
The President. Tell me, what kind of—what hit you the hardest when the pandemic hit?
Mr. Siegel. Right. So the biggest challenge is what were we going to do with our staff. You know, there were so many uncertainties related to what the virus actually did. The first thing that we did was we took all of our at-risk employees, and we sent them home, and we paid them through that entire process. That first wave of PPP loans was very helpful to allow us to do that. Obviously, that was not cost effective, but we felt like we had to do that for our employees.
You know, and we're still struggling because we did—a lot of retail business has actually increased over the course of the pandemic. I think people know there's a little bit of hardware boom.
A big portion of our business is actually Government sales and commercial sales. And, for the first 4 or 5 months, I mean, that was completely gone. And honestly, usually, it's about 60 percent of our annual revenue.
The President. Well, one of the reasons why I changed the rule for—it was 20 days—to make sure only employers that had 20 or fewer employees could qualify for PPP. And the reason for that was, 400,000 small businesses went out of business. They got in line, but they couldn't get the help.
And we found out that an awful lot of that went to big—bigger businesses that, in fact, weren't supposed to qualify for this. Because they—there used be a thing called an ""inspector general"" to see where the money went. And the last administration fired the inspector general, so a lot of money went to people who shouldn't have gotten help, and it didn't go to folks who—but you know, the significance with this new program—and we're going to continue this, by the way—it's not only—you've been—only businesses with fewer than 20 folks could apply for the last couple weeks.
But now we're going to keep the focus on it because there's a lot of minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses are increased significantly by 20, 15—20 and 15 percent, as well as getting people who, in fact, weren't able to get in line before. And it's hard to know how to get in line.
And so I hope this is going to continue to increase, because we're also at the point where I think we're going to begin to gain control of this virus.
Mr. Siegel. Yes, I—and we appreciate your leadership on that.
One quick point I want to make is that: I said we're the oldest hardware store in DC; I also say we're the greenest hardware store in America. We have two urban farms actually in our building. We have Mary, who is in the garage there, and then we have Cultivate the City, which is an awesome rooftop garden. They exist on our rooftop. But you can't—you're not going to be able to see it from here, but if they want to give a wave.
The President. I see them.
Mr. Siegel. Yes.
Participants. Hi!
Mr. Siegel. Yes, and then we also have solar panels——
The President. Don't jump; we need you. [Laughter]
Mr. Siegel. And then, if I could just——

8-Mar-21,Remarks on International Women's Day and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Thank you, Madam Vice President, and thank you, Mr. Secretary.
On Friday, I submitted to the Senate for confirmation my first slate of nominations for four-star command positions in our Armed Forces, among them, two outstanding and eminently qualified warriors and patriots. General Jacqueline Van Ovost—and United States Air Force is currently the only female four-star officer serving in our military. I nominated her as Commander of the United States Transportation Command.
And when confirmed, the Lieutenant General Laura Richardson, of the United States Army, will be promoted in rank and join General Van Ovost as the only four-star—as another four-star general. I nominated her as Commander in the United States Southern Command. And, when confirmed, they will become the second and third women in the history of the United States Armed Forces to lead combatant commands.
Each of these women have led careers demonstrating incomparable skill, integrity, and duty to country. And at every step, they've also helped push open the doors of opportunity to women in our military, blazing the trail a little wider, a little brighter for all the proud women following in their path and looking to their example.
And I wanted to shine the light on these accomplishments for those women today because General Van Ovost—as reiterated in an interview this last week, and I'm the second person to say this—it's hard to be what you can't see. It's hard to be what you can't see, but you'll soon see.
Today is International Women's Day. And we all need to see and to recognize the barrier-breaking accomplishments of these women. We need the young women just beginning their careers in the military service to see it and know that no door will be closed to them. We need women and men throughout the ranks to see and celebrate women's accomplishments and leadership in the services. We need little girls and boys both, who have grown up dreaming of serving for their country, to know this is what generals in the United States Armed Forces look like. This is what Vice Presidents of United States look like.
So I'd like to spend just a few minutes today making sure that America knows who General Van Ovost is and Lieutenant General Richardson is. They're aviators. Both learned to fly planes before they were old enough to drive a car.
General Van Ovost, a first-generation—is a first-generation American: the daughter of Dutch immigrants who owned a flying operation. She loved the freedom of flight and, as a teenager, flew herself to see Sally Ride lift off as the first woman in space. [Laughter] Sixteen years old, goes down to see Sally Ride. She said she was at several thousand feet watching from a distance.
You know, women weren't—were banned from flying combat missions when the general joined the force, so she focused on becoming a test pilot. And instead of learning to fly just one plane, she learned to fly everything, including Air Force Two when I was Vice President.
General Van Ovost currently is—oversees Air Mobility Command: approximately 107,000 airmen and 1,100 planes that enable America's air power and humanitarian assistance to go everywhere in the world it need be. From flying water to Texas after the recent storms to ensuring our wounded warriors are evacuated for medical care from anywhere in the world, she gets it done. Lieutenant General Richardson's parents were proud patriots. It must have rubbed off because Lieutenant General Richardson and her brother and sister all joined the Army. Her father encouraged her to join ROTC in college, even though that meant commuting to a different school.
When Lieutenant General Richardson joined the Army Aviation Branch, women were banned from flying attack helicopters. She flew to—in support of combatant—combat missions, and conducting lift operations of her UH-1—the so-called ""Huey""—and the Blackhawks.
Now, as the commanding general of the United States Army North, Lieutenant General Richardson oversees military ground responses here in North America. All over the last year, that's meant getting military and medical personnel deployed to help in our response to this pandemic. More than 4,500 military medical personnel deployed in hospitals across 14 States and the Navajo Nation to treat COVID-19 patients. It means more than 2,200 medical personnel are working, or soon will be, at vaccination sites in eight States and the United States Virgin Islands.
I'm so proud of the incredible work Lieutenant General Richardson and her team have done to support the American people this year, and the American people are as well. They're warriors. They're crisis-tested commanders.
And best of all—best of all—they're not done yet. Neither of these incredible generals is resting on her laurels or on her stars. They're using their voices and actively working to change policies in the military to make it easier and safer for more women not just to join the military, but to stay in the military and to thrive.
I'm incredibly proud that in 2015, under the Obama-Biden administration, we took the final steps to open up all positions in the military to anyone qualified to serve in them. The women who join today's military aren't told ""no"" when they apply to fly fighter jets or attack helicopters just because of their gender. They aren't told ""no"" when they want to apply to Ranger School or infantry officer basic training.
But they all know that there's much, much more work to be done to ensure that women's leadership is recognized and we have more diverse leaders; we reach the top echelons of command for all who are qualified, including all women—all women; and that all women feel safe and respected in our military—period.
You know, some of it is relatively straightforward work where we're making good progress designing body armor that fits women properly; tailoring combat uniforms for women; creating maternity flight suits; updating requirements for their hairstyles. And some of it is going to take—and—you know, an intensity of purpose and mission to really change the culture and habits that cause women to leave the military:
That women are—making sure more diverse candidates are considering—being considered for career-advancing opportunities at every single level. That women aren't penalized in their careers for having children. That women aren't just token members, but integral parts throughout all branches and all divisions. And that they can completely, fairly engage in promotion and compete all across the board, including on the—on age and gender neutrality and physical fitness test.
You know that both members of the military couples can thrive while serving, like Lieutenant General Richardson and her husband, Lieutenant General Richardson, who, I might add, I want to thank you for getting me off a mountain that was about 12- to 14,000 feet up on a goat path when our helicopter went down in a snowstorm. And it's good to see you, General. The ride down that mountain was more perilous in a truck than it was in the helicopter, but thank you.
And we have to take on sexual assault and harassment and violence against women in the military. Sexual assault is abhorrent and wrong at any time. And in our military, where so much of unit cohesion is built on trusting your fellow servicemembers to have your back, there's nothing less than a threat to our national security.
I know Secretary Austin takes this as seriously as Vice President Harris and I do. That's why his first memo as Secretary was a directive to take on sexual assault in the military and why he stepped up independent review—he set up an Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault to make concrete recommendations for changes.
This is going to be an all-hands-on-deck effort under my administration to end the scourge of sexual assault in the military. And we're going to be focused on that from the very top. I know that we can do it. The U.S. Military has defeated American enemies on land, in air, and at sea, and this is not beyond us.
I want to thank General Van Ovost and Lieutenant General Richardson for their exemplary careers and service to our country. You're America's patriotism at its finest: undaunted and absolutely—absolutely able to do anything by any obstacle; determined to open wide and the doors of opportunity; and ready for the next challenge.
It's my great honor to serve as your Commander in Chief. And I look forward to hearing your Active Duty and recommendations of how we will work together to keep the American people safe to meet every challenge in the 21st century.
So I want to thank you both. And I want to thank the former general—I keep calling him ""General."" But my—the guy who runs that outfit over there. I want to make sure we thank the Secretary for all he's done to try to implement what we've just talked about, and for recommending these two women for promotion.
Thank you all, may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you. [Inaudible]—you don't have to speak. [Laughter] Thank you, everybody.

7-Mar-21,"Videotaped Remarks at the Martin Luther King, Jr., and Coretta Scott King Unity Breakfast in Selma, Alabama","Good morning to everyone joining in this unity breakfast named after Dr. and Mrs. King and to commemorate the anniversary of the march in Selma.
I know this is the first commemoration of Bloody Sunday without Reverend C.T. Vivian, Reverend Joseph Lowery, and Congressman John Lewis. Preachers of the social gospel. Architects of the ""Beloved Community,"" they built not only with words but with action. And reminders that in our lifetime, for Black Americans, the fundamental right to vote has been denied by White supremacy hiding both behind white hoods and in plain sight in statehouses and courtrooms.
Yet those torches and burning crosses, the batons, tear gas, firehoses, attack dogs, and unfair laws and trials could not stop progress. The blood of John Lewis and so many other brave and righteous souls that were spilled in Selma on this Sunday in 1965 sanctified a noble struggle. And when the country saw those images that night, America was forced to confront the denial of democracy, the fierce urgency of justice.
Congress passed the Voting Rights Act a few months later, and President Johnson signed it into law. But the legacy of the march in Selma is that while nothing can stop free people from exercising their most sacred power as a citizen, there are those who will do anything they can to take that power away.
The Voting Rights Act began to dismantle barriers to voting and to make our elections more fair, free, and representative. I was always proud to lead the efforts to reauthorize it over the years as a U.S. Senator in the Judiciary Committee. But at the same time, Republicans at every level have chipped away at it.
Then in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, holding that times have changed and blatant voter discrimination was rare, contrary to the assault that was taking place on the ground. The late Justice Ginsburg wrote that the decision was like ""throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm."" Today, we have a hailstorm, not a rainstorm. A hailstorm.
And in 2020, our very democracy on the line, even in the midst of a pandemic, more Americans voted than ever before. Multiple recounts in States and decisions in more than 60 cases—from judges appointed by my predecessor, including at the Supreme Court—upheld the integrity of this historic election.
Instead of celebrating this powerful demonstration of voting, we have seen an unprecedented insurrection in our Capitol and a brutal attack on our democracy on January the 6th. And never before—a never-before-seen effort to ignore, undermine, and undo the will of the people.
And to think of that, and yet it's been followed by an all-out assault on the right to vote in State legislatures all across the country. During the current legislative sessions, elected officials in 43 States have already introduced over 250 bills to make it harder for Americans to vote. We cannot let them succeed.
Last week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2021. This is a landmark piece of legislation that is urgently needed to protect the right to vote, the integrity of our elections, and to repair and strengthen our democracy. I hope the Senate does its work so that I can sign it into law. I also urge Congress to fully restore the Voting Rights Act, named in John Lewis's honor.
Today, on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I am signing an Executive order to make it easier for eligible voters to register to vote and improve access to voting. Every eligible voter should be able to vote and have that vote counted. If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let the people vote.
And I'll close with this: A few days before he passed, Jill and I spoke with John, Congressman Lewis. But instead of answering our concerns about him—we talked about ""how are you doing, John""—he asked us to stay focused on the work left undone to heal and to unite this Nation around what it means to be an American. That's the God's truth. John wouldn't talk about his pending death or his concerns. He said we've just got to get this done.
That we are all created equal. That we all deserve to be treated equally. On this day of reflection, please, let's stay focused on the work ahead. Let's remember all those who came before us, as a bridge to our history so we don't forget its pain and as a bridge to our future so we never lose our hope.
May God bless their memory, may God bless you all, and may God protect our forces.","NOTE: The remarks were recorded at approximately 4:30 p.m. on March 5 in the Blue Room at the White House.

6-Mar-21,Remarks on Senate Passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon.
It's a good day today. You know, when we took office 45 days ago, I promised the American people that help was on the way. Today I can say we've taken one more giant step forward in delivering on that promise that help is on the way.
I want to thank—start off by thanking the Vice President, but I want to thank all of the Senators who worked so hard to reach a compromise to do the right thing for the American people during this crisis and voted to pass the American Rescue Plan. It obviously wasn't easy, it wasn't always pretty, but it was so desperately needed, urgently needed.
Also, I also need to say a few words about the Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who I spoke with many times on this and again this morning. I served in the Senate, as you all know, for many years. I've never seen anyone work as skillfully, as ably, as patiently, with determination, to deliver such a consequential piece of legislation that was so urgently needed as the American Rescue Plan.
Chuck Schumer—Senator Chuck Schumer, when the country needed you most, you led, Chuck, and you delivered. Neither I nor the country will ever forget that. And it's not a moment too soon. I've been talking about the urgency of this need.
For many—for over a year, the American people were told they were on their own. They were seeing—we've seen how hard that has been on so many Americans. As of last night, 519,064 lives lost to the virus. That many empty chairs this morning—the breakfast table—gone. More than 400 [400,000]* small businesses closed unnecessarily. Millions of people out of work through no fault of their own. I want to emphasize that: through no fault of their own. Food bank lines stretching for miles. Did any of you ever you'd see that in America, in cities all across this country? Families facing the threat of eviction.
This Nation has suffered too much for much too long. And everything in this package is designed to relieve the suffering and to meet the most urgent needs of the Nation and put us in a better position to prevail, starting with beating this virus and vaccinating the country.
The resources in this plan will be used to expand and speed up manufacturing and distribution of vaccines so we can get every single American vaccinated sooner than later. I believe by—we'll have enough by the end of—by the middle of May to vaccinate. It's going to take longer to take longer to get it in their arm, but that's how much vaccine we'll have.
Because of all the funding, we'll be able to hire more vaccinators, set up more vaccination sites to get the country in a place to get back to normal. This plan will get checks out the door, starting this month, to the American people who so desperately need the help, many of whom are lying in bed at night, staring at the ceiling, wondering: ""Will I lose my job, if I haven't already? Will I lose my insurance? Will I lose my home?""
Over 85 percent of American households will get direct payments of $1,400 per person. For a typical middle class family of four—husband and wife working, making $100,000 a year total, with three kids—they'll get $5,600—I mean, with two kids—will get $5,600, and it will be on the way soon. That means the mortgage can get paid. That means the child can stay in community college. That means maintaining the health insurance you have. It's going to make a big difference in so many of lives in this country.
Unemployment benefits will be extended for 11 million Americans who have lost their jobs and who, last night, again were lying in bed, just thinking, ""My lord, I'm going to lose my unemployment insurance in a week or so."" It was about to expire.
Schools are going to have the resources they need to open safely. States and local governments that have lost tens of thousands of essential workers will be—have the resources they need available to them, to those laid-off police officers, firefighters, teachers, and nurses they can rehire. They're our—these are essential personnel.
Look, the American Rescue Plan lowers health care premiums. Food and nutrition assistance. It's hard to believe that 24 million adults and 11 million children, as I speak, in the United States suffer from food insecurity. That means, simply, they don't have enough food to eat. Did you ever imagine in the United States of America, you'd see lines, literally miles long—kids—folks in their automobiles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk. I stood in line, handing out food. The people coming up never, ever, ever thought they'd be in that position. This helps families who are behind on their rent and their mortgage payments so they aren't thrown out of their homes.
Look, the bottom line is this: This plan puts us on the path to beating the virus. This plan gives those families who are struggling the most the help and the breathing room they need to get through this moment. This plan gives small businesses in this country a fighting chance to survive.
And one more thing: This plan is historic. Taken altogether, this plan is going to make it possible to cut child poverty in half. Let me say that again—it's significant, historic—it will cut child poverty in half.
There's much more to this bill, but for now, let me make one final point. When I was elected, I said we were going to get the Government out of the business of battling on Twitter and back in the business of delivering for the American people, of making a difference in their lives, giving everyone a chance—a fighting chance—of showing the American people that their Government can work for them. And passing the American Rescue Plan will do that.
And you know, it may sound strange, but a lot of Senators and Congressmen I want to thank, but I really want to thank the American people for making all of this possible. You say, ""Well, how do they make it possible?"" Well, quite frankly, without the overwhelming bipartisan support of the American people, this would not have happened. Your elected officials heard you. Overwhelming public support—every public opinion poll shows overwhelming support for this plan. And for the last weeks, it's shown that. Every public opinion poll shows the people want this, they believe it's needed, and they believe it's urgent.
And now this bill returns to the House of Representatives, which has done a great job from the beginning, where I hope it will find quick passage so it can be sent to my desk to be signed into law.
By passing the American Rescue Plan, we'll have heeded the voice of the American people, not ignored their voices. By passing this plan, we will have delivered real, tangible results for the American people and their families, and they'll be able to see and know and feel the change in their own lives. And by passing this plan, we'll have proved that this Government, this democracy can still work. What has to be done—it will improve people's lives. And one more thing: The vast majority of economists—left, right, and center—from Wall Street to the private economic polling initiatives, the economists—as I've said, left, right, and center—say, ""In addition to the needs the people have, we need this to grow the economy."" That if we haven't spent this money and recreated the kind of incentive for people to be able to make a good living, that we'd be in real trouble.
This will create millions of new jobs—it's estimated over 6 million new jobs by itself; increase the Gross Domestic Product by a trillion dollars; put our Nation in a position to out-compete the rest of the world—because the rest of the world is moving, particularly China; and to know that as tough as this moment is, there are brighter days ahead. There really are.
As I've said before, it's never a good bet to bet against America. It's never been a good bet to bet against the American people. We are America. We're going to get there. We're going to remain the leading economy in the world and going to be the most successful economy in the world because of you, the American people.
Thank you, and God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, why couldn't you get a single Republican vote on this bill? What do you think the drama——
[At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.]
The President's Agenda 
Q. Why do you think you didn't get a single Republican vote, and what does the drama of the last 24 hours, including with Senator Manchin, tell you about the next 4 years?
The President. They're going to be good. I'm going to succeed. We're going to succeed moving forward.
Look, the American people strongly support what we're doing. That's the key here. And that's going to continue to seep down through the public, including from our Republican friends. There's a lot of Republicans that came very close. They've got a lot of pressure on them. I still haven't given up on getting their support.
Thank you.
Q. [Inaudible]—the compromises?
The President. Pardon me?
Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation 
Q. Your message to House Democrats who were frustrated with some of the compromises in the Senate bill, particularly——
The President. They're not frustrated. Bernie Sanders said this is the most progressive bill he's ever seen passed in history, since he's been here. And the compromises were all compromises that didn't affect the substance and the essence of what the bill is. Going from $300—from $400 to $300, to the unemployment excess. Well, it got extended until September. The end result is the essentially about the same. And so I don't think any of the compromises have in any way fundamentally altered the essence of what I put in the bill in the first place.

I wanted this to be a conversation about what the impact of the $1,400 that our plan has for every American out there and to make sure that I understand what you think is important about it, if you think it's important.
And I also want to—you know, the people you're about to meet, the millions of people who are going to help with this—I think—with this check, that's going to make a big difference in terms of their lives.
And people in the country are hurting right now, with less than 2 weeks from enhanced unemployment checks being cut out. And 7 million kids don't have enough food; 13 million people are behind in their rent. And the American Rescue Plan, I believe—and according to the polling data, the vast majority of Americans believe—is essential to giving them some help and to turn it around.
And I think it's going to provide immediate relief for millions of people that are going to be able to use it in a very constructive way and also grow the economy in the process. But it's essential getting kids back to school safely. It is also getting a lifeline to small businesses, many of whom—400,000—have gone under, affecting entire communities. And it is clearly—clearly—necessary a lifeline for getting the upper hand against COVID-19 and getting it under control.
That isn't some academic discussion. It's about you; it's about people like you and the families I grew up with all over America. And you know, you've all lived lives of service. You not only have taken care of yourself and your families, but you've lived lives of service to help other people as well.
And so, as—again, this isn't an academic discussion. You deserve our thanks and our support. And I'm going to hand it back to Cedric so we can hear from you all while the press is still in here.
White House Director of Public Engagement Cedric L. Richmond. Well, thank you, Mr. President. Today we're joined by three outstanding Americans that exemplify what America stands for and especially your values, which is service to others.
And, first, we have Ms. Alma Williams. Ms. Williams is a paratransit driver. She transports disabled Americans every day. She has four wonderful children, and her youngest is in the process of applying to college. The other two are in college, and one is on her way. So Ms. Williams is close to being a empty nester.
Then, we have George Kerr, who served in the United States Navy for almost 8 years; served on two Air Force carriers. And he volunteers, but also is starting a nonprofit small business to help people with substance use issues and health and harm effects. And he has—which you mentioned earlier—the unfortunate experience of having a house that burned down. And I know that you know that experience very well. And he's just a remarkable individual.
And then, we have Ms. Lyda Vanegas, who volunteers at a DC community health center and spends her time counseling and helping Americans get through this very rough time. And she has seen the effects, firsthand, of the challenges and the pain and the suffering that American citizens are going through, which is particularly important that you say ""through no fault of their own.""
And with that, Mr. President, I'm going to turn it back over to—now we'll turn it over to Ms. Williams so that she can tell us about what she thinks about the American Rescue Plan.
Washington Metro Access Transit Authority driver Alma Williams. Actually, it's a wonderful plan. As well as being a paratransit operator, I'm also union rep for the ATU.
The President. ATU.
Ms. Williams. Yes, sir. And you know, just hearing the things that, you know, my coworkers go through is devastating. You know, we're fighting to work a maximum of less than 40 hours a week, you know? And as I stated to a colleague of mine when—we had a time when we paid our bills on the first of the month, and now we're struggling to pay them on the 15th just to——
The President. And you're still employed?
Ms. Williams. Yes. You know? And it's just a hard time financially, mentally, emotionally—like, across the board for children, adults. You know?
And it's just—I thank you for the plan. I think it will help a wide range of people—you know, not just the working class, but our retirees; you know, our elementary school, you know—the grade schools that—I have nieces and nephews who are very young. And just the transition of going to school every day and now being home all day, stuck behind a computer, it's draining for them too, and they don't understand it. You know? Thank you. I appreciate it.
The President. Okay. I have a lot of questions, but I'm going until we hear—while the press is here—to hear from all three people.
Ms. Williams. Yes, sir.
The President. I'd like to talk more about this, if I can.
Director Richmond. Thank you, Mr. President. With that, we'll turn it over to you, Mr. Kerr.
Navy veteran George Kerr. Well, once again, thank you for having me. It's really important that we're having this conversation. I'm in full support of this piece of important legislation.
As you said, I lost my home in—November 30, 2019. And then, right after that, I got really sick and then COVID happened. And thankfully I did not—have not contracted COVID. But it's led to a lot of other issues.
And being an—having my own LLC, it's very difficult to find contracts right there because of the environment. And people are just not—don't have the funding to get the support they need.
And so I do a lot of work with different organizations. One of them is Mary's House for Older Adults, where we have a—reach out and touch someone, who talks to seniors—LGBTQ seniors—about isolation and being in contact with them. And so mental health is just real important. And I'm glad see there's a lot of money in there for mental health services, because it's incredibly important.
And at the same time, my community—the LGBTQ community—is under attack on a constant basis. And we need to—the trauma that's around there, we need to—needs to be addressed. And I'm hoping and praying that you will be able to sign into law the Equality Act.
The President. So am I.
Mr. Kerr. Thank you.
Director Richmond. And last, but certainly not least, is Ms. Lyda Vanegas.
Mary's Center Vice President of Marketing and Communications Lyda Vanegas. Well, first of all, thank you so much. Thank you for allowing Mary's Center—you know, on behalf of Mary's Center, being me here, you know, to share this story of the many, many families that we have served during this pandemic.
[Ms. Vanegas continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
So, you know, it's this circle of situations that have been impacting all of our families. So, you know, with that comes mental health, trauma, anxiety. And our children don't have laptops. We have been able to distribute about 1,000 laptops or more.
Ms. Williams. Very good.
Ms. Vanegas. But you know, if they have one laptop, but they have three children, how can they all be in school on the same day? So they have to choose. Or they don't have internet connection. So there's a lot around that, and we've been trying to support as much as possible.
The President. Well, thank you for—all of you for what you do. I carry a schedule card with me every day, and on back of the card, I list, on a daily basis, how many people have died from COVID in the United States. As of today, 517,224—not over 500,000; five thousand—517,224. And we will meet the 100 million shots. We're up to 82,572,848 shots. We're going to get this done.
So I'm going to ask some questions now. The press is going to leave, and I'm going to get more personal with you, if I can, and ask some questions if it's okay.","NOTE: The President spoke at 3:25 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to H.R. 1319. Mr. Kerr referred to H.R. 5.","Joseph R.

5-Mar-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen,"The President. Welcome, folks. Can you hear me in my mask?
Q. Yes, sir.
The President. All right. We're about to have an economic meeting, but I want to make a few very brief comments.
Today's jobs report shows that the American Rescue Plan is urgently needed, in our view.
Now, our economy still has 9.5 million fewer jobs than it had this time last year. And at that rate, it would take 2 years to get us back on track. We have 1 million fewer educators—1 million fewer educators—than we did this time last year. We've lost 400,000 small businesses. All those empty storefronts aren't just shattered dreams, they're warning lights that are going off in State and local budgets that are being stretched because of the lack of tax revenue.
And some of last month's job growth is a result of the December relief package. But without a rescue plan, these gains are going to slow. We can't afford one step forward and two steps backwards. We need to beat the virus, provide essential relief, and build an inclusive recovery.
People need the help now. In less than 2 weeks, enhanced unemployment benefits will begin to expire for 11 million people. At least 7 million kids don't have enough food to eat on a regular basis. Thirteen million people are behind in their rent.
And the rescue plan is absolutely essential for turning this around, getting kids back to school safely, getting a lifeline to small business, and getting the upper hand on COVID-19. That's what we're going to be talking about now.
So I thank you all for coming on in. Thank you.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, when will you unveil your Build Back Better plan?","NOTE: The President spoke at 2:25 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White House.

4-Mar-21,Remarks to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Perseverance Rover Team,"Jet Propulsion Laboratory Director Michael M. Watkins. Mr. President?
The President. Yes.
Director Watkins. This is Mike Watkins at JPL.
The President. Hey, Mike. How are you?
Director Watkins. I want to thank you so much. We are very well, especially after the—after February 18.
The President. I tell you what: You did an incredible job.
Director Watkins. We thank you for that, and we appreciate that. And it's our honor to be given these kinds of tasks; it's what we live for.
And so you may see here I'm surrounded by a few hundred of my best friends in this and a couple of other control rooms and online. You know, these are really big team efforts——
The President. I know.
Director Watkins. ——and it's important to us to get as much of the team to join with us today as we could. And we really appreciate your time.
The President. Appreciate it. I'm flattered you'd take the time to let me talk to you.
Director Watkins. Well, we would love to have you out here someday. In fact, I've got two badges for you and the Vice President. So when COVID winds down, I hope you come out here and have a chance to meet the team directly.
The President. I'll be happy to do that. I'll be happy to do that.
Am I supposed to speak now or is Swati?
Director Watkins. Thanks. We would love it. You know, one of the things I wanted to also note—I think—you know, you—I know you watched—I saw pictures of you watching the landing coverage.
The President. Yes.
Director Watkins. And you know, that was a great opportunity, you know, for us to show, I think, the country what, you know, we can do—and the world, really—but also, you know, to bring a whole new generation of STEM, you know, into the fold.
The President. That's right.
Director Watkins. And I think we had a lot of people watching who didn't know that they were STEM people, but now they are——
The President. Yes.
Director Watkins. ——after having watched that. And it's something we—you know, it's very important to us. It's a major part of what we do here at JPL and, of course, NASA as an agency. And we're—it's just great to have that—you know, that bully pulpit to showcase that talent.
The President. It's incredible talent.
Now, am I supposed to speak or is Swati going to say something? I was told I was going to hear from Swati.
Director Watkins. So either way—any way you'd like to do it is fine. We have Dr. Mohan here with me. She—of course, you know her from the landing coverage. But——
The President. Hey, Doc. How are you?
Jet Propulsion Laboratory Engineer Swati Mohan. I'm doing very well, Mr. President. Thank you for——
The President. I just want you to know——
Engineer Mohan. ——for taking the time to speak with us.
The President. Are you kidding me? What an honor this is. This is an incredible honor. And it's amazing. Indian—of descent—Americans are taking over the country: you; my Vice President; my speechwriter Vinay. I tell you what. But thank you. You guys are incredible.
Did you want to say something? I'll be quiet.
Director Watkins. Absolutely. You know, tell us how you felt on landing day and, actually, what path brought you to here at the lab.
Engineer Mohan. Absolutely. So my path actually started way back when I was a child, watching my first episode of Star Trek. [Laughter] In addition to those fantastical scenes of space, what really captured my attention was this really close-knit team who was working together, manipulating this technological marvel with the sole purpose of exploring space and understanding new things and seeking new life.
You know, Perseverance is my first mission at JPL where I've gotten to work from the very beginning of formulation, all the way through operations, and it made me feel like I was part of that crew. Being able to work with this incredibly diverse, talented team that has become like a family, spending years creating our own technological marvel has been a privilege.
You know, those last days and weeks leading up to landing day, it was pretty smooth, but we were all still really nervous——
The President. Yes. [Laughter]
Engineer Mohan. ——and, frankly, terrified until we got through those final 7 minutes. To be able to call ""touchdown"" safely, to see those first images come back from Mars, to see the place where we have never been able to go to on Mars before and go there—reach there for the express purpose of seeking out new life just made it feel like I was living in a dream.
Now that that tremendous relief has passed for the team of being able to be there safely, all that's left is the excitement and the thrill of all the scientific discoveries that are yet to come and what Perseverance can actually find and, hopefully, find those signs of past life on Mars.
The President. Well, I tell you what, you said you feel like you're ""living a dream""—you've created a dream for millions and millions of young kids, young Americans. You talk about STEM. You—it was—look, the thing that I found so exhilarating about this: You all did this—the whole team—the team, in fact, I can see now and the entire team at JPL—what you did: You restored a dose of confidence in the American people.
They were beginning to wonder about us. They were beginning to wonder: Are we still the country we always believed we were? You guys did it. You guys gave a sense of ""America is back."" It's astounding what you did. You should not underestimate it. You should not underestimate it. You know, you did it the most American way: You believed in science, you believed in hard work, and you believed there wasn't a darn thing you couldn't do if you put your minds together.
One of the reasons why we're such an incredible country is, we're such a diverse country. We bring the best out of every single solitary culture in the world here in the United States of America, and we give people an opportunity to let their dreams run forward.
And you just—I can't tell you how much—you know, everyone was so down the last years about: Is America still the, you know, the fount of change? And are we still the country that has hopes and develops and pursues the most unlikely things to happen? And we are. And you all demonstrated it.
I'm not being—look, I'm not—I really mean this. It's so much bigger than landing Perseverance on Mars. It's about the American spirit, and you brought it back. You brought back in a moment we so desperately need it.
I was reaching—I was talking to a head of state who was calling me about thanking me—or not thanking me—congratulating me on becoming President. And then, I later heard from another head of state, saying: ""America has changed so much. They used to be so competent to do great things, and here they can't even deal with the coronavirus. Look how badly organized they are."" That was said by a head of state.
And America's image in the world—and it matters. It matters because democracies have to demonstrate they can run as efficiently and more efficiently than autocracies. There's a big battle going on. Your kids are going to be studying about when democracy once again reestablished it could do anything, as opposed to autocracies that can just command things.
I just can't tell you how much I believe historians are going to write about what you did at the moment you all did it—at the moment you all did it. You should take such great pride—such great pride—in what you did.
We can land a rover on Mars. We can beat a pandemic. And with science, hope, and vision, there's not a damn thing we can't do as a country. We have never, ever, ever failed to meet a goal. We've set our mind to it, and we've done it together. And that's what you all showed. So it goes way beyond—way beyond—the whole notion of what you just recently did.
And God only knows what is going to come from this. God only knows what's going to happen. But you all are incredible. All the dreams you've created in other people's minds, other young kids.
I tell you what: I just wanted to thank you and tell you, you know, you—it just seems that, you know, we're on the side of the angels. Just at the moment when things look like they're really dark in America over our history, something has come along. Something has come along. And you guys came along and you did this.
And so I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart and tell you how presumptuous of me to say I'm proud of you, but I am so proud of you. And, Mike, the teamwork that still exists there, the importance of it, the consequence of what you're doing—and it's only just the start.
I had a group of folks in my office not too long ago—House and Senate Members—I mean, House Members—Democrats and Republicans—talking about infrastructure. And I have in the—on the shelf in my Oval Office, a Moon rock. And they walked over and said, ""This is actually a Moon rock, from the Moon?"" And I jokingly said: ""You ain't seen nothing yet. Wait until see what comes home from Mars."" So, anyway, folks, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're great Americans, and you've demonstrated it again: There's not a thing we cannot do when we set our mind to it.
God bless you all. Thank you. Thanks, Mike.
Director Watkins. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
The President. And by the way, I'm like a poor relative, Mike. When I'm invited, I show up. So be careful. You know, the poor relatives, they show up even——
Director Watkins. We will——
The President. They stay longer than they're supposed to. I'm one of those kind of guys. [Laughter]
Director Watkins. Well, we will be more than happy to have you, and stay as long as you want.
The President. I'm looking forward to seeing you all in person.
Thank you.
Director Watkins. We'll get you an office here.
The President. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Bye-bye. Godspeed.
Director Watkins. Thank you, sir.

We're going to talk about infrastructure and American competitiveness and what we're going to do to make sure we once again lead the world across the board in infrastructure. It's a—it not only creates jobs, but it makes us a hell of a lot more competitive around the world if we have the best infrastructure in the world. So we're going to be talking about that.

3-Mar-21,Remarks During the House Democratic Caucus Virtual Issues Conference,"The President. [Laughter] Nancy, I love you. There's no one I'd rather work with than you. We've been friends a long time—and your whole family, your daughters. And it's just been a great relationship.
And I think that Angie was absolutely correct that you've been the consummate leader. I've been here a long time, and there's been no Speaker that's been your equal, although there have been some great Speakers. And you just have a special way about you, Nancy. And you're also very, very—which is important—you're kind, but you're tough. And you know what's right, and you stick by it. And I admire the devil out of you.
And I want to thank somebody I campaigned for—he was leading by 30 points until I campaigned for him, but he still won anyway—Hakeem Jeffries—and Vice Chair Aguilar for putting this conference together and including me. And I want to thank the entire leadership team and all your committee chairs for taking an important step in the American Rescue Plan last week. You all showed, at a time when the American people are depending on us—and they are desperately in need of us—that a diverse caucus isn't a divided caucus.
Congressman Clyburn, I also want to note that it was almost exactly a year ago today that you delivered the endorsement to me in South Carolina that meant so much to me and my campaign. And you're a great friend. And on the night of the—that primary, America had confirmed only fewer than 100 COVID cases. That's just a year ago.
Breonna Taylor and George Floyd were still alive. California had yet to suffer the worst—what would become the worst fire season in recorded history. And there'd been no violent insurrection on the Capitol Hill. And I could go on. A lot's changed.
My point is this: In the year that has passed, all the challenge I spoke about that night—jobs and the economy; affordable, accessible health care; climate change; and the need to root out institutional racism; the need for unity and healing—have all become urgent—urgent, urgent, urgent—especially in light of the pandemic that has taken the lives—well, as of yesterday—518,720, I believe it was, Americans—fellow Americans who have lost their lives.
And more than 400,000 businesses—mostly small businesses, many minority businesses—have been shuttered; cost of millions of jobs; 1.3 million public sector—education, nurses, cops, firefighters, essential workers—have lost their jobs.
So my message today is really simple: You—you, this caucus—have shown the American people the difference Democratic leadership and what we just had. Leadership makes a difference. And you're continuing to do so.
For example, I know that this week you're working on the ""Protect Our Democracy"" reforms, as well as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act—both of which I strongly support. And I know that, in the past couple of days, you've had briefings and conversations on immigration, health care, foreign policy, climate crisis, and a lot more. And as you work on all of these, I urge you to continue to speak up and speak out about the American Rescue Plan.
And here is why: You know, the confidence in the American—in American government has been plummeting since the late sixties to what it is now. And many of you remember that in 2009, we expended a lot of political capital—Nancy and I and others—in the Recovery Act. It was an act that had less than two-tenths of 1 percent waste or fraud in it, according to the experts, and the economists told us we literally saved America from a depression.
But we didn't adequately explain what we had done. Barack was so modest, he didn't want to take, as he said, a ""victory lap."" I kept saying, ""Tell people what we did."" He said: ""We don't have time. I'm not going to take a victory lap."" And we paid a price for it, ironically, for that humility.
And this is a case where every single piece of the bill you passed addresses a genuine, desperate need for the American people. Each piece isn't just defensible, it is urgent and overwhelmingly supported by the people. It's good policy, and it's good politics. And I'm not sure we've ever seen something that is needed as badly as the American Rescue Plan that was as broadly popular.
Nancy and I have passed some really important things in our careers, but they haven't always been—they've been badly needed, but they haven't been overwhelmingly popular.
Served—I've served in the Congress for 36 years before becoming Vice President for 8. We never had anything this urgent and this ambitious that was so widely embraced. Three-quarters of the American are together with—on this. Three quarters. Nearly unanimous support among Democrats; more than 70 percent of independents. In poll after poll, 60 percent of Republicans—I'll say that again—60 percent of Republicans support what we're doing. A bipartisan group of more than 425 mayors, Democrat and Republican. The AFL-CIO and business leaders.
Look, the show of unity we're seeing is unprecedented. It isn't just about the sum of the total package; Americans are lockstep on each major element of the plan, and they know what they are. They support what we're doing on vaccines.
Look at the progress we've made with your help. We've been able to move us to the point where we had very little supply, to we will have enough vaccine because of the work we've done with your help—enough vaccine by the end of May to be able to vaccinate every single adult in America. It will not be done by then, but that supply will be there.
They support what we're doing on direct payments, on unemployment insurance, on food and nutrition support, on keeping people in their homes, on safely reopening our schools.
Staying unified as we complete this process to pass the American Rescue Plan won't just make a difference in our fight against COVID-19 and our efforts to rebuild the economy, it will also show the American people we're capable of coming together for what matters most to them. They've lost faith in government; this is a time to reestablish that faith. And the reason why they should have faith is because we're doing the right thing. It's a show of strength and a first step forward to restoring their faith in the capacity of government to have their backs. And if we deliver on this, it also builds momentum. It builds real enthusiasm as well.
And I will make everything else we want to deliver—this will make everything more possible to get it done. That's why starting off with this victory is so important, because it's so consequential to their lives. And we know how much we have to do, but all starts—it all starts here. It starts by bringing this home, bringing home what you've done all the way.
And I know we're all making some small compromises, but I want to thank you. I want to thank you for the work you've done. I want to thank you for the work we're going to continue to do.
I know parts of this—and everything else we seek to do—are not easy, but people are going to remember how we showed up in this moment, how we listened to them—to them, not special interests; to them—and how we took action. I believe we're going to come through this, and I think that people's memories will be long. And if we continue to stay laser focused on getting shots in people's arms, responding to the economic crisis, it's going to open up a lot of hearts and a lot of doors for us tomorrow to do the many more things we know we have to do.
So I want to thank you all. I really mean it from the bottom—I want to thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And I'm happy to take questions if that's what—I'm supposed to do, Nance. Whatever you want me to do.","NOTE: The President spoke at 5:20 p.m. from the South Court Auditorium of the Dwight D.

These are Members of the House, Senate—Democrat, Republican—who all have an extremely keen interest in doing what I said once before: that I'd love to be the President to preside over the end of cancer as we know it. These are the folks in the House and Senate who would love to preside over cancer—the end of cancer as we know it. And they all were critical in the CARES Act, which put about $9 billion into NIH to deal with cancer and cancer research.
And the Vice President and I are of the view that we can make significant strides in fighting cancer and Alzheimer's and other diseases, if we take a slightly different approach. And what I want to talk with them about today is how we go about taking advantage of the work they've done to get us where we are today, because I think we're on the cusp of some real breakthroughs across the board on cancer. And that's what we're going to talk about.
And probably to all of you, like all of us, cancer is personal for almost everybody. It's probably the one word that is the most frightening word in the English language to people. When they hear that ""C word,"" cancer, it is just devastating.
And I always ask at—when I talk about cancer, I ask the audience if they—to raise their hand, if any of them were suffering from cancer as I spoke, and/or they lost someone, and virtually 70 percent of every audience—whether or not it's 4,000 people or 400 people. And a lot of folks in this room have, like many of you I—maybe have been victims of cancer and overcome it.
But there's so much hope that that's what I want to talk about with these folks—about what we do, from a legislative and a substance point of view, to make the kind of inroads I think we can make. That's what we're talking about today.
Thank you for coming in. And we're—I'm optimistic we're going to get something done here.
Rocket Attacks at Ayn Al Asad Air Base in Anbar Province, Iraq 
Q. Mr. President, troops—U.S. troops were targeted with rocket attacks. Any response?
The President. We are following that through right now. Thank God no one was killed by the rocket. One individual, a contractor, died of a heart attack. But we're identifying who is responsible, and we'll make judgments from that point.
Okay? Thank you.
Removal of Texas State Mask Mandate/Coronavirus Prevention Efforts 
Q. Do you have a response to Texas relaxing its COVID restrictions?
The President. I didn't hear the question.
Q. Message to Texas and Mississippi—Texas and Mississippi?
Q. [Inaudible]—COVID restrictions?
The President. Texas, I think it's a big mistake. Look, I hope everybody has realized by now: These masks make a difference. We are on the cusp of being able to fundamentally change the nature of this disease because of the way in which we're able to get vaccines in people's arms. We've been able to move that all the way up to the end of May to have enough for every American to get—every adult American to get a shot. And the last thing—the last thing—we need is Neanderthal thinking that, in the meantime, everything is fine, take off your mask.
Forget it. It still matters.
I carry a card with me—I don't have it. I put it on my desk. As of last—as of yesterday, we had lost 511,874 Americans. We're going to lose thousands more. This will not occur—we'll not have everybody vaccinated until sometime in the summer. We have the vaccine to do it. Getting a shot in someone's arm and getting the second shot are going to take time. And it's critical—critical, critical, critical—that they follow the science: Wash your hands—hot water; do it frequently. Wear a mask. And stay socially distanced.
And I know you all know that. I wish the heck some of our elected officials knew it.
So thank you very much.","NOTE: The President spoke at 1:50 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. Participating in the meeting were Sens. Patricia L. Murray, Richard J.

2-Mar-21,Remarks on COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"Good afternoon, folks. The Vice President and I have some good news to report, and I'd like to make two key announcements today related to our COVID-19 vaccination effort.
As you know, a few days ago, after a rigorous opening—open and objective scientific review process, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. We should all be encouraged by this news of a third safe and highly effective COVID-19 vaccine. The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we're going to overcome this virus and get back to our loved ones, get our economy back on track, and start to move back to normal.
But that's—one of my first goals in office was—when I got into office was to say that there will be 100 million vaccination shots administered in my first 100 days in office. We've got halfway to that goal in 37 days, and I feel confident we'll make it all the way.
As I—and as I've said, we have a long way to go, but you know, as I said from the outset, we're going to use every resource of the Federal Government to make it happen. Among the things I learned when I came into office was that Johnson and Johnson was behind in manufacturing and production. While we had the potential of another highly effective vaccine to accompany the two existing vaccines, it simply wasn't coming fast enough. So my team has been hard at work to accelerate that effort.
As I've always said, this is a wartime effort, and every action has been on the table, including putting together breakthrough approaches. And today we're announcing a major step forward: Two of the largest health care and pharmaceutical companies in the world—that are usually competitors—are working together on the vaccine. Johnson and Johnson and Merck will work together to expand the production of Johnson and Johnson's vaccine. This is the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War II.
We also invoked the Defense Production Act to equip two Merck facilities to the standards necessary to safely manufacture the J&J vaccine. And with the urging and assistance of my administration, Johnson and Johnson is also taking additional new actions to safely accelerate vaccine production. Johnson and Johnson's vaccine manufacturing facilities will now begin to operate 24/7.
In addition, we'll continue to use the Defense Production Act to expedite critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies. I've also asked the Department of Defense to provide daily logistical support to strengthen Johnson and Johnson's efforts. And I want to thank Johnson and Johnson and Merck for stepping up and being good corporate citizens during this national crisis.
Here's what all this means: We're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May. Let me say that again: When we came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America. We rectified that. About 3 weeks ago, we were able to say that we'll have enough vaccine supply for adults by the end of July.
And I'm pleased to announce today, as a consequence of the stepped-up process that I've ordered and just outlined, this country will have enough vaccine supply—I'll say it again—for every adult in America by the end of May. By the end of May. That's progress, important progress.
But it's not enough to have the vaccine supply. We need vaccinators—people to put the shots in people's arms, millions of Americans' arms. To date, we've brought back retired doctors and nurses. We've developed—we deployed more than 1,500 Federal medical personnel you usually see during natural disasters, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency—FEMA—and the Commissioned Health Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Defense Department, including the National Guard, with thousands of more to come.
We're also increasing the places where people can get vaccinated. We've sent a—millions of vaccines to over 7,000 pharmacies to make it easier for folks to get their COVID-19 vaccine shot like they would their flu shot.
The Federal Government is also working with States to set up hundreds of mass vaccination centers in places like stadiums, community centers, parking lots that vaccinate thousands of people per day. My wife Jill and I just visited one in Houston last week. It's incredible.
And with this increased production of three safe and effective vaccines, we have an opportunity to help address the urgent national need more quickly and getting our schools back open safely. Right now an entire generation of young people is on the brink of being set back a year or more in their learning. You can ask millions of parents; they understand. We're already seeing rising mental health concerns due in part to isolation.
Educational disparities that have always existed grow wider each day that our schools remain closed. And remote learning isn't the same for every student, as you all know.
Our educators are doing everything they can to protect and educate our students, despite the lack of resources and as districts face budget crises that risk education jobs.
Moms and dads are exiting the workforce in astonishing numbers in order to care for and manage the school experience for their children at home, hindering their own opportunities for—and further undermining the health of our economy.
This is a national imperative that we get our kids back into the classroom safely and as soon as possible. As you know, back in December, I set a goal of having a majority of our K-through-8 schools open by the end of my first 100 days as President.
To achieve that goal, I sent the American Rescue Plan to Congress to provide vital help to make sure schools can open safely—reopen safely. Essential things like more teachers to reduce class sizes, more buses and bus drivers to transport our kids safely, and more space to conduct in-person instructions, and more protective equipment, school cleaning services, physical alterations to reduce the risk of the spread of the virus—all cost money. The House passed the American Rescue Plan last week, and I hope the Senate will follow as quickly and as well.
You know, also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, issued new guidelines on how to reopen schools safely. It's a roadmap that will enable schools—if they have the resources they deserve—to reopen safely. I have given those schools a roadmap. I've asked Congress to give them the tools. And today, to add one more tool to school reopening: a vaccinated workforce.
Let me be clear: We can reopen schools if the right steps are taken, even before employees are vaccinated. But time and again, we've heard from educators and parents that they have anxieties about that. So as yet another move to help accelerate the safe reopening of our schools, let's treat in-person learning like an essential service that it is. And that means getting essential workers who provide that service—educators, school staff, childcare workers—get them vaccinated immediately. They're essential workers. Over 30 States have already taken the step to prioritize educators for vaccination. And today I'm using the full authority of the Federal Government. I'm directing every State to do the same. My challenge to all States, Territories, and the District of Columbia is this: We want every educator, school staff member, childcare worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March.
To help make this happen, starting next week and for a month—the month of March—we will be using our Federal pharmacy program to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K-through-12 educators and staff and childcare workers. Throughout March, they will be able to sign up for an appointment at a pharmacy near them. And I want to be very clear: Not every educator will be able to get an appointment in the first week, but our goal is to do everything we can to help every educator receive a shot this month, the month of March.
I want to conclude with this: We're making progress from the mess we inherited. We're moving in the right direction. And today's announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic. But I have to be honest with you: This fight is far from over. I told you I'd be straight up with you from the beginning. As I said many times, things may get worse again as new variants spread and as we face setbacks, like recent winter storms in the Midwest and South. But our administration will never take this public health threat lightly.
Though we celebrate the news of the third vaccine, I urge all Americans: Please keep washing your hands, stay socially distanced, wear masks—keep wearing them, get vaccinated when it's your turn. Now is not the time to let up. I've asked the country to wear masks for my first 100 days in office. Now is not the time to let our guard down. People's lives are at stake.
We have already—and I carry this in my pocket—lost more—as of today, we've lost more than 511,839 Americans, as of today. It's got to stop.
We need the United States Senate to follow the House and pass the American Rescue Plan, because despite the optimism, without new resources, our entire effort will be set back. We need the resources in the American Rescue Plan, and we need it urgently. We need them expanding testing, ramp up vaccine distribution, fund FEMA and other Federal vaccine efforts, and continue reimbursing States for their efforts.
We need the resources to expand genomic sequencing; to stay ahead of emerging variants; find the protective gear, transportation, staffing, and other costs required for school and business to open safely. We need to fund it. The bottom line is: We need the American Rescue Plan now—now.
There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable. We can't assume that. We must remain vigilant, act fast and aggressively, and look out for one another. That's how we're going to get ahead of this virus, get our economy going again, and get back to our loved ones.
So thank you. And please, please, it's not over yet. Great news, but stay vigilant. May God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you all very, very much.
Q. Mr. President, why is only 1 percent going to the vaccine, sir? Why is only 1 percent going to the vaccine, sir?
Federal Coronavirus Response Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, based on the news you announced, when do you think things will get back to normal? When do you think things will get back to normal?
The President. When do I think things will get back to normal? I've been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don't know for sure. But my hope is, by this time next year, we're going to be back to normal, and before that—my hope. But again, it depends upon if people continue—continue—to be smart and understand that we still can have significant losses. There's a lot we have to do yet. So thank you.

1-Mar-21,Remarks Prior to a Virtual Meeting With President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico and an Exchange With Reporters,"President Biden. It's great to be with you, Mr. President. You know, this is—my second call to a foreign leader in my third day as President was you. And now you're my second virtual meeting with a foreign leader, and that's not by accident. The important of our relations—the importance of our relationship with Mexico is vital to the North American partnership we have and paramount to all the elements of my administration's priorities. So I'm delighted to be with you.
Of the 16 visits I made to Latin America and the Caribbean as Vice President, four of them were to Mexico, and I was honored to meet you on one of those visits, Mr. President.
During my visits, I got to know Mexico a little bit and its people and paid my respects to the Virgin of Guadalupe. As a matter of fact, I still have my rosary beads that my son was wearing when he passed. And I walked the beautiful and historic cobblestones of Mexico City and spoke with Mexicans of all walks of life. And I treasure those memories, and I hope to be able to build on them in the next 4 years.
Mr. President, this is what I know: The United States and Mexico are stronger when we stand together. There's a long and complicated history between our nations, and haven't always been perfect neighbors with one another, but we have seen over and over again the power and the purpose when we cooperate. And we're safer when we work together, whether it's addressing the challenges of our shared border or getting this pandemic under control.
In the Obama-Biden administration, we made a commitment that we look at Mexico as an equal, not as somebody who is south of our border. You are equal. And what you do in Mexico and how you succeed impacts dramatically on what the rest of the hemisphere will look like. 
And as you know, the fastest growing population in the United States is Hispanic. And 60 percent of the Hispanic population is Mexican American. They're an integral part of our history, and I keep a bust of a civil rights leader, Chávez—César Chávez—in my Oval Office as a reminder.
And, Mr. President, I'm looking forward to our discussion today and to the many ways we'll have to work together as neighbors and partners in meeting our shared challenges. And thank you for doing this.
[At this point, President López Obrador spoke via videoconference from Mexico City, Mexico.] 
President López Obrador. President Biden, I would like to start by thanking you for your confession regarding your devotion to the Virgin of Guadalupe. We, as Mexicans, respect and admire two symbols. They might be different; however, they call to the plurality of our country. One is the Virgin of Guadalupe, as you said, and the other one is Benito Juárez, a liberal President, the best one we have ever had, a Zapotec indigenous that we are very proud of.
I would like to thank you also for starting the conversation this way: Mexico—for stating that Mexico is as important to you. It is a pleasure to greet you. It is important that we base our good relationships on constant dialogue, periodic dialogue. I know our relations in the future will be even better. We are united by 3,180 kilometers of border. But we are not only united by geography; we are also united by our economies, our trade, our culture, our history, and our friendship.
We had a Mexican President who dominated the country for 34 years—very little time. His name was Porfirio Díaz. And he would say, ""Poor Mexico, so far from God and yet so close to the United States."" [Laughter] I can now say that it's wonderful for Mexico to be close to God and not so far from the United States. [Laughter]
I believe our countries will allow us to develop jointly in these dire times. Integration will strengthen both our countries as we are faced with this inevitable expansion of other regions. Our relations are strategic.
I would like to also thank you after the call that we have had for wanting to base our relations on respect and equality. It is important for Mexico, and we must keep on cooperating for further development based on independence and autonomy, potentializing what our peoples mean to us.
We are very thankful that you are willing to maintain good relations for the good of our peoples in North America: the Canadian, the United States, and the Mexican peoples.
President Biden. Well, thank you, Mr. President. I'm going to ask the press whether they'd be kind enough to exit shortly here. [Laughter] I'd appreciate it. Thank you very, very much. Thank you.
Mexico-U.S. Relations 
Q. Mr. President, are you sending vaccines to Mexico? Sending vaccines to Mexico? Are you sending? Are you considering?
President Biden. We're going to talk about that.
Q. How about a program for immigration—[inaudible]?
President Biden. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, a number of Republicans—[inaudible]?","NOTE: The President spoke at 4:57 p.m. from the Roosevelt Room at the White House.

27-Feb-21,Remarks on House of Representatives Passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,"The President. Good morning, folks.
For a few weeks now, an overwhelming percentage of the American public has made it clear that they support my American Rescue Plan. And the House of Representatives took the first step toward making it a reality. And I want to thank—and I called her just a few moments ago—Nancy Pelosi for her extraordinary—Speaker Pelosi—for her extraordinary leadership and all those who supported our plan.
And with their vote, we are one step closer to vaccinating the Nation. We are one step closer to putting $1,400 in the pockets of Americans. We are one step closer to extending unemployment benefits for millions of Americans who are shortly going to lose them.
We're one step closer to helping millions of Americans feed their families and keep a roof over their head. We're one step closer to getting our kids safely back in school. And we're one step closer to getting State and local governments the money they need to prevent massive layoffs for essential workers.
Now the bill moves to the United States Senate where I hope it will receive quick action. I have—we have no time to waste. If we act now—decisively, quickly, and boldly—we can finally get ahead of this virus. We can finally get our economy moving again.
And the people of this country have suffered far too much for too long. We need to relieve that suffering. The American Rescue Plan does just that: It relieves the suffering. And it's time to act.
I thank you all for being here. I appreciate it.

26-Feb-21,"Remarks at the Federal Emergency Management Agency COVID-19 Mass Vaccination Site in Houston, Texas","You're all being very polite. You've been with me all day, and it's dinner time. [Laughter]
Good afternoon—or almost. Actually, it's evening. And I want to thank you, Governor and Mrs. Abbott, for your hospitality and your friendship. And Representative—Senator Cornyn, I think he had to go back; I think he's getting on a plane. He told me last—he came in to see me last event. And Representatives Shirley [Sheila]* Jackson Lee, Al Green, Sylvia Garcia, Lizzie Pannilli—excuse me, Pannill [Elizabeth Pannill Fletcher]*—and—what am I doing here? I'm going to lose track here. And Mayor Turner, Judge Hidalgo. Thank you all for welcoming us.
Severe Winter Storms 
And Jill and I wanted to visit Texas today for a couple of reasons: First and foremost, to let the people of Texas know our prayers are with you in the aftermath of this winter storm. And secondly, to let you know what I told Governor Abbott and Mayor Turner and Judge Hidalgo and the congressional delegation: that we will be true partners to help you recover and rebuild from the storms and this pandemic and the economic crisis. We're in for the long haul.
Earlier today we received an update on the storm relief efforts from—from Harris County, at the Harris County Emergency Operations Center. The folks there are doing God's work, as my mother would say. It was an important update on how the Federal Government and the States are working together through the major disaster declaration and the emergency declarations that I made after the storm hit when the Governor contacted me.
The Federal Emergency Management, FEMA, is providing millions of gallons of water and millions of meals, direct assistance, to uninsured homeowners to repair the damage burst pipes caused to millions of homes across this State. And the public assistance that comes with a disaster declaration ensures that mayors and county officials can find shelter for folks in need and keep them safe and warm. This in addition to the more than 125,000 blankets FEMA has also made available to storm victims so children and families don't go to sleep cold.
FEMA, working with the Defense Logistics Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers from the Defense Department, has made generators and diesel fuel available to hospitals and nursing homes and other critical facilities to keep the lights on and speed power restoration along the way. Many local military bases are helping efforts to distribute water and food, fuel, and blankets all across this State. And I especially want to thank the servicemembers for helping your fellow Americans in time of need. When we have a problem, we always call on the military—domestic or foreign—no matter what. You're the best in the world.
And I know millions of Texans have been impacted by the disruption of community water systems as a result of the power outages. The Environmental Protection Agency has deployed mobile drinking water labs in Houston, San Antonio, and Fort Worth to test water so we can get the—so you can get boil water advisories lifted and get safe drinking water flowing through those faucets again. There's more, but let me say this: We're not here today as Democrats or Republicans. We're here today as Americans. The American leaders, with responsibility—all of us here in this parking lot—responsibility to all the people we serve. When a crisis hits our States, like the one that hit Texas, it's not a Republican or Democrat who's hurting, it's our fellow Americans who are hurting. And it's our job to help everyone in need. Look out for one another. Leave nobody behind.
COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts 
That's what we've seen today in our visit. After our briefing on the storm relief, we stopped by the Houston Food Bank that's also doing God's work—incredible operation—just like everyone else here in this—in the vaccination center. They've done thousands of people. Thousands of people. It's making a fundamental difference in the safety and security of people.
The more people get vaccinated, the faster we will beat this pandemic. That's why one of my first steps and my first goals as President was to announce that I was going to get 100 million COVID vaccine shots administered in my first 100 days. And because of the people behind me and others, America would be the—is going to be the first in the country—perhaps the first in the world—to get that done.
And I'm proud to say we're halfway there: 50 million shots. Actually, I was telling the Congressman earlier, I carry a little card with me. And it lists, every day, the number of—the actual number of vaccines that have been administered. As of today, five—as of last night, 503,587—every single one matters—in just 37 days. Weeks ahead of schedule. We're weeks ahead of schedule. Even with setbacks from the winter storm, we're moving in the right direction.
Look, in the last 6 weeks, we've gone from 6 million shots right before we took office, in total, to 12 million shots per week now. We've increased vaccine distribution by 70 percent. Sixty percent of the people over the age of six—60 percent of the people over the age of 75 have received at least one shot. Close to 50 percent of the people over the age of 65 got at least one shot. And you say, why am I focused on that? Well, it's especially important because people over the age of 65 account for 80 percent of all the COVID deaths. Eighty percent.
Roughly 75 percent of the people who live in long-term care facilities now have gotten their first dose, and those cases are at the lowest level since reporting began in May. We're making this progress because of all of you. The Federal Government and the States are working together along with public and private partners.
It starts with supply. We worked with vaccine manufacturers—Pfizer and Moderna—to ensure we have enough supply to supply all adults in America by the end of July. And we discovered that vaccine manufacturers, though, weren't getting prioritized when it came to securing supplies they needed to fix their problem of not being able to go more rapidly. So I used the Defense Production Act to speed up the supply chain for key equipment that's already helped increase vaccine production.
Last week, I toured the Pfizer vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan. It's incredible: the precision, the safety, the pride, the sense of purpose, everyone involved at that facility. And we've all seen the news about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine today. It's just the third safe, effective vaccine. And it's out. They've approved it today. We're going to use every conceivable way to expand manufacturing of the vaccine—the third vaccine—to make even more rapid progress at getting shots in people's arms.
Here's what else we're doing: We're increasing the number of vaccinators. The people putting the—it's one thing to have the vaccine; it's another thing to get it in people's arms. We've brought back retired doctors and nurses by Executive order, allowing that to happen. We've already deployed more than 1,500 professionals—medical professionals—you see during natural disasters from FEMA, our Commissioned Corps from the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Defense Department, including the National Guard. And we're lining up thousands more.
We're also setting up more places to get vaccinated. And today—as of today, we provided $3.8 billion to States, Territories, and Tribes to create hundreds of new vaccination centers and ramp up existing ones. We're providing personnel and equipment, and we're covering the costs for States, including the use of their National Guards.
Here in Texas, it's meant millions of dollars and hundreds of vaccinators working at community vaccination centers and three mass vaccination centers in Arlington, Dallas, and right here in Houston, on the other side here, that vaccinate thousands of Texans a day. Tens of thousands overall.
I want to show the American people the extraordinary effort being made and undertaken in the most difficult operational challenge this Nation has ever faced logistically. It's remarkable. About 6,000 doses a day here.
Folks who are eligible can call by phone, sign up online for an appointment, drive in, stay in their cars, get a shot, in and out in a very short amount of time. It requires massive logistical coordination and critical Federal support from FEMA and the National Guard to work with cities and States, and the Houston Texans, to stand up this kind of site.
Vice President Harris and I did a virtual tour of a similar vaccination center in Arizona. One nurse—one nurse there said—she talked about the shots, talking how many they were getting in people's arms, and she said she felt like she was administering—and get this—a ""dose of hope."" A dose of hope.
We're working with Governors across the country to stand up and lend Federal support to hundreds of vaccination centers: from stadiums, like here, to community centers, to houses of worship, large parking lots, delivery places. Doses of hope we can get in people's arms as quickly as possible.
I've also sent millions of vaccines to thousands of local pharmacies—over 7,000—to make it easier for folks to get the COVID-19 vaccine shot like they would a flu shot, because people are comfortable going to their local pharmacy. They go there for their flu shot and everything else. They trust the pharmacist, and they're likely to go.
Here in Texas, that includes 500 pharmacies across this State, like Walmart and CVS, including 50 pharmacies here in Houston. And for the folks who didn't live near a vaccination center or a pharmacy, we're deploying mobile clinics to go out to those neighborhoods in rural areas where people are unable to get to the centers. These are special vehicles with pop-up clinics that meet folks where they live and where they don't have the transportation to get the shots, which they'll be launching very soon here in Houston—that mobile—those mobile units—as well as Dallas, Arlington, and across the State.
We've also started to send vaccines directly to community health centers to help the hard-to-reach folks in cities, small towns, and rural communities; in Black, Latino, and Native American communities that have higher rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths than any other group.
Here in Texas, we're already partnering with 12 community health centers in 10 cities, which have combined sites at over 100 locations across the entire State. We're going to save people's lives. As a result of these round-the-clock efforts, in 5 weeks, America has administered the most shots of any country in the world. That's great progress. And it's also true that while COVID-19 vaccinations are up, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are down.
But I need to be honest with you. I said from the beginning—like Roosevelt who said, I'll shoot you ""straight from the shoulder""—you can handle anything as long as you're told the truth. Cases and hospitalizations could go back up with new—as new variants emerge. And it's not the time to relax. We have to keep washing our hands, staying socially distanced. And for God's sake, wear your mask. Wear your mask. It's not a political statement, it's a patriotic thing to do.
Some of our progress in this fight is because so many Americans are stepping up and doing these things. And the worst thing we could do now would be let our guard down.
And here's another critical point: We're going to hit a phase in this effort, maybe late April or early May, when many predict there will be ramped-up vaccine supply and we'll have administered shots to most of the people who really are eager to get them and those who have been able to get there. But at the same time, the warning is: There'll be people who live in hard-to-reach areas who can't get the shots, and there are folks who are hesitant to take the shots.
We all know there's a history in this country of subjugating certain communities to terrible medical and scientific abuse. But if there's one message that needs to cut through all of this: The vaccines are safe. I promise you. They are safe and effective. Listen to Dr. Fauci. Listen to the scientists who developed them through extensive and rigorous review. I did. And I took my shot publicly to demonstrate to the American people it's safe and effective. To address this challenge, we're going to launch a massive campaign to educate people about the vaccines: that they are safe and effective, and that they can go and get those shots and be good.
I'm going to close with this: This past year has been one of the most painful years in American history. As I said, we've lost over 500,000 lives to the virus. Five hundred thousand moms and dads, husbands and wives, sons and daughters staring at an empty chair at that dining room table or the kitchen table; friends, neighbors, coworkers, and over the country—all over the country where the loved ones who are gone—they're gone. Empty. Empty feeling in your chest, like you're being sucked into a black hole in your chest. But all over the country, where loved ones once sat, there's an empty chair.
And, folks, look, there's so much we can do. As you see the broken hearts in the families that have been left behind, there's nothing partisan about this virus. It's too long we've allowed the virus to divide us.
I met today with Governor Abbott, Senator Cornyn—conservative Republicans. I'm a Democratic President. We disagree on plenty of things, and there's nothing wrong with that. But there are plenty of things we can work on together, and one of them is represented right here today: the effort to speed up vaccinations. We're not giving shots to Democrats or Republicans. I say it again: We're giving shots to Americans.
All across the country, we've got members of the Armed Forces, FEMA, volunteers, retirees, fellow Americans working around the clock to give these shots. And they're building on the work of scientists, researchers, doctors, and nurses. And my team at the White House, which is coordinating all of this, is first rate.
None of this has a partisan tinge or a partisan element to it. This can be a great American achievement—being the only country in the world to reach 100 million shots in 100 days. This could unite us as a country—to vaccinate America, to protect America, to heal America. And I know we can do this. Why? Because I know America can do great things when we do it together. I know my family spent a lot of time here in Houston, by the way, at—hey, John Eddie. How are you, buddy? I didn't see you there. At Houston, at MD Anderson, when our son Beau was being treated for glioblastoma before he passed away.
Just yesterday I saw MD Anderson announce its joint—he joined four—they joined four other major cancer hospitals to help break down the silos that make real progress in this effort difficult. Now they're sharing data and information. That wasn't going on 4 or 5 years ago. We're going to beat cancer. I know we will. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: If there is just one thing—one thing—I could be known for as President, it would be to end—the President who, during his era, ended cancer as we know it.
But then, last week—guess what?—we also landed a rover on Mars. We—led by a NASA team in Pasadena, California. A rover carries instruments developed by a team here in Houston that will be used in the mission of our time and our dreams. Imagine. We tell—everybody has been so down the last number of years about what America—what can we do? Who are—we can do anything! America can do anything. And now we see the images that are truly stunning: battling COVID, beating cancer, going to Mars.
If there's one thing I know about America, it's this: Americans never give up. They never give in. They never cry uncle. They just struggle, innovate, and they preserve—and persevere. We're going to get through all of this, I promise you. And we're going to do it together. Together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. You're the best. We can do all of this, guys. I promise you. We can do this. Nobody in the world can compete with us when we're together. Thank you all so very much.","NOTE: The President spoke at 4:47 p.m. at the NRG Stadium. In his remarks, he referred to Cecilia Abbott, wife of Gov. Gregory W.

25-Feb-21,Remarks at the National Governors Association Virtual Winter Meeting,"The President. Thank you very much. Thank you, Andrew. I appreciate it a lot. I appreciate your friendship.
Let me start by saying: Guaranteed, if we're able to, we'll not only have you next year, at this time, for the Governors' conference, but we'll have whatever food you want. We can go around to each one of you. We just order individually.
But all kidding aside, I'm anxious to see—I wish you could all be here because it's much better if we're all—we all do better when we're able to look at each other in the eye and know what we're talking about. But thank you. Some of you have been here in the meantime, but I hope to have the Governors' conference here next year, God willing.
You know, I've been talking to several of you quite a lot—a bit lately. And as you know, we have approved disaster declarations in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. In Texas, FEMA was already on the ground providing support for COVID-19 vaccination efforts. So they were able to move quickly to supply generators, food, blankets, and, most importantly, water.
And, Governor Abbott, I don't want to ruin your reputation, but I look forward to coming down tomorrow, to Houston, to be with you. And I want you and the residents to know that we're here to provide the Federal assistance you need to support your State, your local, and Tribal response efforts.
And it's clear that even when the immediate crisis passes, there's going to be more work to be done to help constituents recover. And my administration will be there every step of the way with you because when people in this country need help, they're not Democrats or Republicans, they're all Americans. And people who need work, they're the people getting sick from COVID, and people facing eviction, people going hungry, people struggling with the opioid crisis, and people who need broadband—they're not Democrats or Republicans, they're our fellow Americans.
And I think the whole spirit of this Governors' conference and our administration is changing the attitude a little bit about how we deal with one another, at least I hope so.
As Governors, you know this: You know that you have one job, and that's to deliver. You're in the frontlines—to overuse that phrase, but it's hard to overuse it. And as the saying goes, ""You're the laboratories of democracy."" Your challenges can provide—prove to be lessons for everybody. Your successes can prove to be a model for everybody.
The storms that hit the south were a painful reminder that so many of our challenges don't stop at our border of our States. They don't make distinctions based on how the State is made up. Today I want to focus on two of those challenges that cross borders: COVID and the economy. You know better than I do: As you know, the ability to deal with one will determine our ability to address the other.
On Monday, our Nation passed a grim, grim milestone: COVID-19 has now taken over 500,000 of our fellow Americans. That's more than died in World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam war combined. And most Governors, that's more than the population of your largest cities in your State or your Territories—gone. Gone. And as a country, we have to remember those we lost, but particularly those we left behind. But as we remember, we also have to act to end the politics of misinformation that has divided families, communities, and the country and that has cost too many lives already. We have to fight this together, as one, to state the obvious.
I know you all know this. As a friend of mine, you say you not only understand me, you ""overstand"" me. We're the United States of America, and this cruel winter is not over. And if we come together, we can usher a more hopeful spring. We can usher it in. And that's what we're working to do together.
As you know, I came into office, and I set a goal which was mocked for—by some; none of you, but by some. I set a goal of saying we're going to do hundred million shots—get hundred million shots in people's arms in my first hundred days as President. I directed Jeff Zients, my COVID Response Coordinator, to lead my administration and work with vaccine manufacturers to buy more vaccines and speed up delivery.
We used, as some of you have suggested, the Defense Production Act to speed up supply chains for key equipment like fill pumps and filters, which have helped increase vaccine production. We've increased vaccine allocations as Andrew said—as the Governor said—to your States by almost 70 percent since coming into office, whatever number days ago it's been, 37 or something like that. We secured enough vaccine to supply 300 million Americans—300 million—to take care of all their needs, in terms of vaccination, by the end of July.
And we're all—and we've all seen in the news that Johnson and Johnson vaccine is—if the FDA approved the use of this new vaccine, we would plan to roll out as quickly as Johnson and Johnson can make the vaccine.
Of course, it's not just getting the vaccines, it's getting the vaccines into arms. And this is another place where your work and our partnership is making a big difference. I've signed an order to allow retired doctors and nurses to give shots. We've deployed—as you referenced indirectly, at least, Andrew—we've deployed over 1,500 Federal personnel as vaccinators, and we're funding 1,200 of your guards men and women to serve as vaccinators as well. And we're paying for your Guard for that purpose. We'll work with you to create more places where Americans can get vaccinated, supporting communities in high-volume vaccine centers and across your States.
The result is that we have doubled the daily vaccination rate from where it was when we took office, and we've completed 50 million shots in 37 days. And we're now—we've now given more shots than any nation in the entire world. Nearly 60 percent of people over the age of 75 have now received at least one shot. It was 14 percent 6 weeks ago. Close to 50 percent—because of your help—of the people over 65 have received one shot. It was 8 percent 6 weeks ago.
And this is so important because people over 65, as you know better than anyone, account for 80 percent—80 percent—of all the COVID deaths. Additionally, about 75 percent of the people who live in long-term care facilities have gotten their first dose. And those cases are at their lowest level since reporting began in May.
At the same time, we're also delivering more than 25 million masks—ordered this last week—25 million masks to over 60,000 food pantries, soup kitchens, community health centers all across America, helping protect some of our Nation's most vulnerable people.
And all—and these are all necessary steps to helping the economy rebuild. Necessary steps, not only—but not only steps; it's enough to build back to where we were before. We need to build back better. And we—I think we—all of us know how to do that. We remember what happened in the States back in 2008: Hundreds of thousands of jobs disappeared every month in that Great Recession. And we passed the Recovery Act. We provided State and local fiscal aid. We sent funding to your school districts to help save over 300,000 education jobs. We provided middle class tax relief. We invested in the future, rebuilding roads and bridges; making the biggest clean energy investment in history and the single biggest investment in infrastructure since Eisenhower's Interstate Highway program. And we created, in the process—you all created in the process over thousands—hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs.
Now, economists tell us that saved us from a depression. Well, that's the approach I think we need to take today. But there's one big difference: We need to be more ambitious right now. The greatest risk from all the major economists, from Wall Street to overseas to the major think tanks, is that we don't do enough of what is needed; it's when we do too little.
You know, in every one of your States and Territories, red and blue, millions of Americans are hurting badly. We see it in ways that we've never expected in America. Four hundred thousand small businesses gone in an instant. Gone. People who thought they had secure jobs out of work, due to no fault of their own. The difference here is, people are hurting through no fault of their own. Lines miles long in your States. People who never ever, ever, ever thought they'd ever have to worry about going hungry, waiting for someone to put a box of groceries in their trunk.
Women's participation in the workforce—you all know this—is driven to its lowest level in more than three decades. So many women are facing the devastating choice between a paycheck, and care and education of their child. Our cities and towns have shed 1.3 million jobs since just last March: educators, nurses, cops, firefighters, other essential workers.
The economic toll of this pandemic continues to tear through our country as brutally as the virus itself. And so we need to comfort [confront]* the economic—you know, we just have to step up. The economic toll we have to address with the same aggressiveness and seriousness of purpose as we do the virus. And that's what the American Rescue Plan does.
Instead of chasing COVID-19, it allows us to get ahead of it with more testing, supplies, vaccinations. It gets our kids back to school safely—many of you are already doing that—so students can catch up on learning they've lost and parents can finally catch a break.
The American Rescue Plan finishes the job of getting a total of 200,000—or $20,000 in direct payments to people. Getting direct relief to people is a lifeline for them and bumps our economy into higher gear.
And there's more to the American Rescue Plan, and much more it will do: provide flexible aid to your cities and States to help essential workers stay in the job and essential services keep going. It provides rent relief, food, and nutrition and assistance to millions of children and families facing hunger.
And the American Rescue Plan also expands access to affordable childcare that's going to enable parents, particularly mothers, to get back to work. It provides assistance to mom-and-pop small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth and the glue of our communities. And it covers the cost of paid leave for businesses whose workers are sickened by COVID-19. And it fills an important gap in our Nation's safety net that helps reduce the spread of the virus. I could go on. I'm probably already going on too long. But you know a lot of it already because the plan was created to include many of the things you have individually and collectively asked me for in recent conversations.
The bottom line is: The American Rescue Plan meets the moment. An analysis by Moody's estimates that it will help the economy create 7 million more jobs this year alone. And it would be on the way to another 18 million jobs, Moody's estimates, would be created over the next 4 years with our Build Back Better recovery plan.
Look, what we do now will determine whether we build from a position of strength or whether we lose years to sluggish and unequal recovery. And the only way to contain this pandemic and help the American people as quickly as possible is passing the plan as quickly as possible. The vast majority the American people from both parties support it, according to the data. I'm grateful to many of you, Democrats and Republicans, who have expressed support as well.
We are not the type of nation that can or will stand by and watch our people suffer needlessly through no fault of their own. It goes against our conscience. It goes against sound economics. It's not who we are. We're a people who know that there's nothing we've ever failed to do when we've set our mind to doing it. So let's get this done.
I've gotten over 400 mayors contacted me to get this plan passed. I—a lot of you have moved to do that. Send millions of Americans—wherever they live, whoever they voted for—a strong message that help and hope are on the way. We can do this.
And I hope that Jill and I, as I said, can welcome you all to the White House next year's—for next year's meeting.
And may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. We've got a lot to do, guys, but we can do it.","NOTE: The President spoke at 4:35 p.m. from the South Court Auditorium of the Dwight D.

25-Feb-21,Remarks on Commemorating the 50 Millionth COVID-19 Vaccine Shot,"Well, thank you all. Dr. Fauci, thanks for your leadership, thanks for being here.
Two weeks ago, I spent some time with you and Dr. Francis Collins—excuse me—the Director of the National Institute of Health, at NIH, and gave me a tour of the Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, Maryland. And it's the place where our top scientists spend years researching and developing vaccines and treatments of all kinds of—for all kinds of viruses.
The brilliant team there made possible the rapid deployment and development of COVID-19 vaccines, and they're truly remarkable. And this administration will follow the science to deliver more breakthroughs.
You now, we are doing that to beat COVID-19 and other diseases, like cancer—which is something that's so personal to so many families, including me and Kamala's and many of yours. We've asked Dr. Eric Lander, a renowned Harvard-MIT scientist, to serve as my Science Adviser and head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and co-lead the President's Council—the Presidential Council on Advisory Science and Technology.
These are the White House offices that bring together the country's top scientists to address our most pressing needs, and they'll be part of the work to develop a DARPA-like advanced research effort on cancer and other diseases, just like we do DARPA in the Defense Department, which develops breakthrough projects to secure our national security.
And relatedly, I'm delighted to see five of the Nation's leading cancer centers are joining forces today to build on the work of the Cancer Moonshot I was able to do during the Obama-Biden administration to help break through silos and barriers in cancer research. We're making progress.
There is so much we can do, so much progress within our reach. And that's why I'm thankful to the folks here today for getting their vaccine shots: Gerald Bunn, who—and Corey Hamilton, both DC firefighters. I said to Corey, you know, that old expression, ""God made man, and then he made a few firefighters."" Thank God we have them. And Linda Bussey is a manager at a Safeway grocery store in Bethesda. Victoria Legerwood Rivera, who is a local school counselor. And Elizabeth Galloway, who is a registered nurse who administered these shots.
And the more people get vaccinated, the faster we're going to beat this pandemic. That's why one of my first goals in office when I—just before I was sworn in, I indicated that my goal was to get a hundred million COVID-19 vaccine shots in people's arms in my first hundred days as President. At first, critics said that goal was too ambitious; no one could do that. And then, they said it was too small. But the bottom line, though, is that America will be the first country—perhaps the only one—to get that done.
And today I'm here to report we're halfway there: 50 million shots in just 37 days since I've become President. That's weeks ahead of schedule, even with the setbacks we faced during the recent winter storms, which devastated millions of Midwestern cities, towns, and also the same in the South.
We're moving in the right direction, though, despite the mess we inherited from the previous administration, which left us with no real plan to vaccinate all Americans. And every time we administer another 50 million shots, I'm going to use that milestone to report to the American people on our vaccination program and on our overall fight against this pandemic. The good and the bad, I'll tell you; the success and the failures.
And here's the deal—here's the deal—the story of this vaccination campaign is like the story of everything hard and new America does: some confusion and setbacks at the start, and then if we do the right things, we have the right plan to get things moving. That's what we're seeing right now.
Weeks before I became President, the previous administration saw 6 million shots administered in the last week. This coming week, we will administer over 12 million shots, double the pace, in just 6 weeks that we've been in office.
Other milestones: We've increased vaccination distribution to States by 70 percent. Nearly 60 percent of people over the age of 75 have now received at least one shot. It was 14 percent 6 weeks ago. And close to 50 percent of people over the age of 65 have at least one shot now. It was 8 percent 6 weeks ago. It's important because people over 65 account for 80 percent of all the COVID deaths. Additionally, about 75 percent of the people who live in long-term facilities have gotten their first shot. And those cases are at the lowest level since reporting began in May.
Here's how we've been doing it: It starts with increasing the supply. My team has worked very hard with vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer and Moderna, to ensure we have enough supply for all adult Americans by the end of July. When we discovered the vaccine manufacturers weren't being prioritized when it came to securing supplies they needed to make the vaccine, we fixed the problem. I used the Defense Production Act to speed up the supply chain for key equipment, which has already helped increase vaccine production.
Last week, I toured the Pfizer facility—manufacturing facility in a plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan. It's an incredible—it's incredible the precision, the safety, the pride, and the sense of purpose everyone involved in that process and project has.
We've all seen the news about Johnson and Johnson's vaccine. The idea of a third safe and effective vaccine is very promising. The Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, is viewing the data and review recommendations from an outside committee of experts that will be meeting tomorrow.
Now, let me be clear: We are going to do this the right way. The FDA will decide on an emergency use authorization of a vaccine based on science, not due to any political pressure from me or anyone else. No outside factors.
What I will say to the American people is this: If—if—the FDA approves the use of this new vaccine, we have a plan to roll it out as quickly as Johnson and Johnson can make it. We'll use every conceivable way to expand manufacturing of the vaccine, and we'll make even more rapid progress on overall vaccines in March. I'll have more to say about this in the days after the FDA review.
Look, we've been laser-focused on the greatest operational challenge this country has ever undertaken: administering shots in the arms of hundreds of millions of Americans. We're increasing the number of vaccinators. What we found was, you may have the vaccine but not enough people put the vaccinate—vaccine in someone's arm, like you just saw.
We brought back retired doctors and nurses. We've already deployed more than 1,500 medical personnel you see during national disasters, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA; and we commissioned—our Commissioned Corps from the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Defense Department, including the National Guard—supplying vaccinators. We're lining up thousands more to do the vaccinations. We're also setting up more places for people to get vaccinated. As of today, we've provided $3.8 billion to States, Territories, and Tribes to create hundreds of new vaccination centers and ramp up the existing ones that are there already; working with Governors across the country, in red and blue States, to bolster their efforts to stand up hundreds of vaccination centers: from stadiums, to community centers, houses of worship, large parking lots.
We're providing personnel and equipment and covering the costs for the States, including for the use of their National Guard, which have been—they're incredible. Today Jill and I—or I should say, tomorrow Jill and I will travel to Houston, Texas, to tour one of the first Federal mass vaccination centers and to thank everyone involved. This is an example of the kind of partnership between Federal, State, and local governments and public and private partners that's going to get this job done.
We also sent millions of vaccines to thousands of local pharmacies all across America to make it easier for folks to get the vaccine shot like they would their flu shot, going to a familiar place, familiar folks that they can trust and know to get the shot.
And for folks who didn't live near—don't live near a vaccination center or a pharmacy, we're deploying mobile units. These are special vehicles and pop-up clinics that meet folks where they live and where they don't have transportation to get the shots—to get to the places to get the shots.
We've also started to send vaccines directly to community health centers to help the hard—the hard-to-reach folks in cities and small towns, in rural communities; in Black, Latino, Native American communities that have higher rates of COVID infections and deaths than any other groups.
As a result of these round-the-clock efforts, in 5 weeks, America has administered the most shots of any country in the world—any country in the world—with among the highest percentage of population fully vaccinated. That's progress we promised.
And it's also true that while COVID-19 vaccinations are up, COVID cases and hospitalizations are coming down. But I need to be honest with you: Cases and hospitalizations could go back up with new variants as they emerge.
So I want to make something really very clear: This is not a time to relax. We must keep washing our hands, stay socially distanced, and for God's sake—for God's sake—wear a mask. Some of our progress in this fight is because so many Americans are stepping up and doing those things. And the worst thing we could do now is let our guard down.
Of course, it's my hope to come back in the next—to report that we've—after we've done another 50 million shots before the end of my first 100 days.
But here's the critical point. As hard as it is now to believe, we're going to hit a phase in this effort, maybe as late as April or May, where many predict that instead of long lines of people waiting to get a shot, we'll face a very different scenario: We'll have the vaccine waiting. We'll have ramped up vaccine supplies. We'll have administrative—folks to administer the shots to the most of the people who aren't eager to get the shots. At least, that's been the prediction.
I don't think—I think—I don't think it's going happen; I think the more people see other people getting the shots, it's going to build confidence. But you know, at the same time, there are people who live in hard-to-reach areas who can't get them. And there are folks who are hesitant to take the shot in the first place. And we all know there's a history in this country of subjecting certain communities to terrible medical and scientific abuse.
But if there is one message that needs to cut through, it's this: The vaccines are safe and effective. And I believe as you see your neighbor, your husband, your wife, your son, your daughter getting it, that you will be much more inclined to get it. Listen to Dr. Fauci. Listen to the scientists who developed these vaccines, and the extensive and rigorous review that it went through. I did. I took my shots publicly to demonstrate to the American people that it's safe and effective.
But the time is coming, maybe 60 to 90 days, when the supply is adequate, but not enough people can access the shots or don't want them. To address that challenge, we're going to launch a massive campaign to educate people about vaccines, that they are safe and effective, and where to go to get those shots in the first place. And we're going to bring together leaders of all segments of our society to educate and encourage all Americans to get vaccinated.
So I hope the Senate will soon confirm a key leader to that effort, my nominee for the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, who did so well in his hearing this week. And I hope Congress passes the American Rescue Plan, which I've been pushing, which provides funds for everything we need to do to beat this pandemic and to get the economy going again.
Now, critics say the plan is too big, that it costs too much. But let me ask a rhetorical question: What would you have me cut? What would you have me cut out? On vaccines alone, if we don't invest 20 million—billion dollars to vaccinate the Nation—doesn't that make sense? Or $160 billion in total towards the pandemic for testing, to protective gear, to vaccine production and distribution? I'm ready to hear any ideas on what will make the American Rescue Plan better, stronger, and effective. But we'll have to answer who will get helped and who will get hurt.
I want to close with this: The question I ask—I'm asked most often is, ""When will things get back to normal?"" My answer is always honest and straightforward. I can't give you a date. I can only promise that we'll work as hard as we can to make that day come as soon as possible.
While things are improving, and we're going from a mess we inherited to moving in the right direction, at significant speed, this is not a victory lap. This—everything is not fixed. We have a long way to go. And the—that day, when everything gets back to normal, depends on all of us. It depends on Congress passing the American recovery act—research plan—Recovery Plan. And also for us to remain vigilant, to look out for one another.
I've said it before: Wash your hands. Stay socially distanced. Wear a mask. Get the vaccine when it's your turn. When your friend or neighbor or loved one is eligible, encourage them to get vaccinated.
And when all—above all, remember: We can do this. This is the United States of America. There is nothing we can't do when we do it together. So it's not over yet, but we're getting close. And, God willing, if we do all we know we have to do, we're going to beat this; beat it sooner than later.
And may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your time.

24-Feb-21,Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on United States Supply Chains and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon. The Vice President and I had a very productive meeting with a bipartisan group of Senators and House Members to address an issue of both concern for our economic security, as well as our national security: the resilience and reliability of our critical supply chains.
This is a critical area where Republicans and Democrats agreed it was one of the best meetings—it's the best meeting I think we've had so far, although we've only been here about 5 weeks. But it was like the old days—people actually are on the same page.
We were—there were—good, bipartisan work has already been done. The leaders of this operation in the House and Senate already did—have done great work, and I want to thank them for their leadership.
We're here to build on that. And the bottom line is simple: The American people should never face shortages in the goods and services they rely on, whether that's their car or their prescription medicines or the food at the local grocery store.
And remember, the shortages in PPE during the pandemic—that meant we didn't have the masks; we didn't have gowns or gloves to protect our frontline health workers.
We heard horror stories of doctors and nurses wearing trash bags over their gown—over their dress in order to—so they wouldn't be in trouble—they—because they had no gowns. And they were rewashing and reusing their masks over and over again in the OR.
That should never have never happened. And this will never happen again in the United States, period. We shouldn't have to rely on a foreign country—especially one that doesn't share our interests or our values—in order to protect and provide our people during a national emergency.
That's why one of the first Executive orders I signed, as some may remember, was to ensure that we're manufacturing more protective equipment for health care workers here at home. And today I'm shortly going to be signing another Executive order that will help address the vulnerabilities in our supply chains across additional critical sectors of our economy so that the American people are prepared to withstand any crisis and rely on ourselves.
This is about making sure the United States can meet every challenge we face in this new era—pandemics, but also in defense, cybersecurity, climate change, and so much more. And the best way to do that is by protecting and sharpening America's competitive edge by investing here at home. As I've said from the beginning, while I was running: We're going to invest in America. We're going to invest in American workers. And then, we can be in a much better position to even compete beyond what we're doing now.
Resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains are going to help revitalize our domestic manufacturing capacity and create good-paying jobs, not $15 an hour—which is what we need to do someday, and sooner is better, in my view—but jobs that are at the prevailing wage.
We're going to spare new—spur new opportunities for small businesses, communities of color, and economically distressed areas. And I will drive new investment in research and innovation and our workforce, investing in training and university partnerships that are going to lead to new technologies and new solutions. And all this won't just strengthen our domestic capacity, it will help unleash new markets around the world and grow opportunities for American businesses to export their goods that we're going to be making.
These are the kinds of commonsense solutions that all Americans can get behind: workers and corporate leaders, Republicans and Democrats. It's about resilience, identifying possible points of vulnerabilities in our supply chains, and making sure we have the backup alternatives or workarounds in place.
Remember that old proverb: ""For want of a nail, the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe, the horse was lost."" And it goes on and on until the kingdom was lost, all for the want of a horseshoe nail. Even small failures at one point in the supply chain can cause outside impacts further up the chain.
Recently, we've seen how a shortage of computer chips—computer chips like the one I have here; you can hardly see it I imagine; it's called a ""semiconductor""—has caused delays in production of automobiles that has resulted in reduced hours for American workers. A 21st-century horseshoe nail.
This semiconductor is smaller than a postage stamp, but it has more than 8 billion transistors—8 billion transistors—10,000 times thinner than a single human hair in this one chip. These chips are a wonder of innovation and design that powers so much of our country, enables so much of our modern lives to go on: not just our cars, but our smartphones, televisions, radios, medical diagnostic equipment, and so much more.
We need to make sure these supply chains are secure and reliable. I'm directing senior officials in my administration to work with industrial leaders to identify solutions to this semiconductor shortfall and work very hard with the House and Senate. They've authorized the bill, but they need nearly $37 billion, short term, to make sure we have this capacity. And we'll push for that as well. But we all recognize that the particular problem won't be solved immediately.
In the meantime, we're reaching out to our allies, semiconductor companies, and others in the supply chain to ramp up production to help us resolve the bottlenecks we face now. We need help to stop—we need to stop playing catchup after the supply chain crisis hit. We need to prevent the supply chain crisis from hitting in the first place.
And in some cases, building resilience will mean increasing our production of certain types of elements here at home. In others, it'll mean working more closely with our trusted friends and partners, nations that share our values, so that our supply chains can't be used against us as leverage.
It will mean identifying and building surge capacity that can quickly be turned into and ramped up production in times of emergency. And it will mean investing in research and development, like we did in the sixties, to ensure long-term competitiveness in our manufacturing base in the decades ahead.
The order I'm about to sign does two things. First, it orders a 100-day review of four vital products: semiconductors—one; key minerals and materials, like rare earths, that are used to make everything from harder steel to airplanes; three, pharmaceuticals and their ingredients; four, advanced batteries, like the ones used in electric vehicles. There's strong bipartisan support for fast reviews of these four areas because they're essential to protecting and strengthening American competitiveness.
Second, this order initiates a long-term review of the industry basis of six sectors of our overall economy over the next year. These reviews will identify policy recommendations to 40 of our supply chains, to—excuse me, to fortify our supply chains at every step, and critically, to start implementing those recommendations right away. We're not going to wait for a review to be completed before we start closing the existing gaps.
And as we implement this work, my administration will draw on a full range of American talent—including labor and industry leaders, policy experts, scientists, farmers, engineers—to get their input.
I'm grateful for the Members of Congress who came to see me, Republican leaders, as well as Democrats. They're leading the way. We're going to stay in close contact with Members of both sides of the aisle and keep advancing our shared goals.
Everyone has a role to play to strengthen our supply chains in our country. This is the United States of America. We are better prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century than any country in the world. There's nothing—nothing, nothing—we've ever failed to achieve if we work together. And that's what we decided to do today, and that's what we're going to do: work together.
So I thank you all. I'm very optimistic about the meeting we had today with our congressional colleagues. And now I'm going to walk over and sign that Executive order.
[At this point, the President signed the Executive order.]
Thank you all very much.
Senate Confirmation Status of the President's Cabinet Nominees 
Q. Mr. President, are you disappointed that more of your Cabinet nominees have not yet been confirmed by the Senate?
The President. I am, but I don't so much blame it on the Senate; I blame it on the failure to have a transition that was rational.
As you know, previous administrations had a significant number of their Cabinet confirmed before they even were sworn in. That's the tradition. But we're doing fine. I think we're going to be in good shape.
Q. What about Neera Tanden?
The President. Thank you.

24-Feb-21,Remarks During a Meeting With Members of Congress on Strengthening United States Supply Chains,"Folks, we're going to have a meeting today to talk about the critical supply chain issues that we—that affect us all, affect this country.
The last year has shown the vulnerability we have with some of the supply chains, including the PPE that we needed badly, but had to go abroad to get. And there are current strategies—and these little chips here for automobiles that I didn't realize how many billions of chips are in here—but causing some lines to slow down and people not being laid off, but at least to shorten the shifts.
And so we're going to talk about that. John Cornyn and this—again, this is a bipartisan group here—put together an effort last year that I think was a pretty good effort, dealing with how to deal with these chips, but there's other aspects of shortages as well. That's what we're going to talk about. And it's nice to have everybody down here, and—on a subject matter we all agree on, and figure out how we get it all done.
So thank you all for coming on in, and I appreciate it.","NOTE: The President spoke at 2:12 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Sen.

23-Feb-21,Remarks to Members of the Press With Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada,"[President Biden spoke virtually from the White House.]
President Biden. Good evening, everyone. Justin, we had good meetings.
Prime Minister Trudeau and I just concluded a very productive bilateral meeting, the first of what I'm sure will be many close and cooperative sessions.
One of our last foreign trips I made was—as Vice President was to visit the Prime Minister in Ottawa. And today we were able to drive right into the many vital issues of importance for both our nations.
For both our nations, getting COVID under control at home and around the world is the immediate priority. And we committed to work together to help prevent future biological threats by strengthening the World Health Organization, supporting our bold targets under the Global Health Security Agenda, cooperating on the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons [and Materials]* of Mass Destruction, and engaging in—other multilateral institutions to promote transparency, build capacity, and strengthening global norms.
We also agreed to work in close cooperation to strengthen the supply chain security and resilience and to ensure that Canada and the United States are driving a robust economic recovery that benefits everyone, not just those at the top.
That's especially important because we know that this pandemic is not affecting everyone the same way. Women are dropping out of work—in the workforce at alarming rates. Black, Latino, and Native are also—and other minority communities are particularly hard hit.
We also agreed to work together on a inclusive recovery, using the tools available to us through the small and medium enterprise chapter of our trade agreement to support women- and minority-owned businesses.
And we also doubled down on our efforts to tackle climate change. It was really, really encouraging. Now that the United States is back in the Paris Agreement, we intend to demonstrate our leadership in order to spur other countries to raise their own ambitions. Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad. To that end, we're launching a high-level Climate Ambition Ministerial and to align our policies and our goals and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
Prime Minister Trudeau and I share an unwavering faith in the capacity of our peoples to meet the challenges of this new age if we lead with our core strengths: our democratic values, our diverse and dynamic peoples.
We both recognize our responsibility, as leading democracies, to defend our shared values around the world and to strengthen our own democracies at home. That means rooting out systemic racism and unconscious bias from our institutions and our laws, as well as our hearts. Today we agreed to reestablish the Cross-Border Crime Forum and work together to modernize our approach to community safety and to do all—the most we can—do more to take on racism and discrimination in both our systems.
Canada and the United States are not only vital partners, we're NATO allies, committed to shared defense. The Prime Minister and I discussed our work with our European allies to bolster transatlantic security, which includes meeting our Wales commitments.
We also agreed to modernize the North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, which is still the only binational military command of its kind. And we will launch an expanded U.S-Canadian Arctic dialogue to cover issues related to continental security, economic and social development, and Arctic governance.
And finally, coming on the heels of the G-7 meeting last Friday, it was an opportunity for Prime Minister Trudeau and I to explore our bilateral partnership to reinforce and help drive issues of concern in our hemisphere and globally. That includes coordinating our approaches to better compete with China and to counter threats to our interest and values.
Let me reiterate our support for the release of the detained Chinese—the detained in China, two Canadians: Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, excuse me. Human beings are not bartering chips. You know, we're going to work together until we get their safe return.
Canada and the United States will stand together against abuse of universal rights and democratic freedoms. We're going to strengthen our shared commitment to providing safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers and so much more.
The United States has no closer and no more important friend than Canada. Our nations share a close geography and history that will forever bind us together, but our values are even more consequential.
It's—but it's the shared spirit of our people that's going to ensure ours is a future of hope and opportunity. Canadians and Americans are innovative, creative, entrepreneurial, competitive, open hearted, and rights respecting. There's nothing we cannot achieve when we commit ourselves to it. And when we work together, as the closest of friends should, we only make each other stronger.
So thank you again, Mr. Prime Minister, for your friendship and for your leadership. And I look forward to when we're able to meet in person and all that Canada and the United States are going to accomplish together.
So God bless you, and thanks for today.
[At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke virtually from Ottawa, Canada.]
Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you so much, Joe. Thank you, tout le monde. Merci tout le monde. Thank you. Let me begin by saying that all of us are thinking of our friends in Texas right now. I know SaskPower has been sending electricity down. And as I told the President, Canada is here to help however we can.
Mr. President, it's been great to sit down with you this afternoon. This is, of course, not the first time we've worked together. Back in 2016, I had the pleasure of hosting you here in Ottawa as Vice President. Over dinner, I remember talking about how the extraordinary friendship between Canada and the United States has not just weathered changing seasons, it has grown ever deeper and stronger.
Well, today we're taking our next step forward. The President and I discussed the ambitious new partnership roadmap, based on shared values and priorities, that will guide our countries work together over the coming years. In the face of COVID-19, of climate change, of rising inequality, this is our moment to act. So we're not wasting any time in getting down to work. Job one remains keeping people safe and ending this pandemic. This afternoon the President and I discussed collaboration to beat COVID-19, from keeping key supplies moving and supporting science and research, to joint efforts through international institutions. We're standing united in this fight.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and no transcript was provided. He then continued in English as follows.]
I know the President and I are on the same page when it comes to standing up for the middle class and people working hard to join it.
And with millions of families relying on the Canada-U.S partnership, this is work we must do together. Just take the energy industry. Canadian energy workers power homes on both sides of the border. It goes to show that we're all better off for this partnership.
Today the President and I discussed leveraging supply chains and support for businesses to create good well-paying jobs and help people who've been hardest hit get back on their feet.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and no transcript was provided. He then continued in English as follows.]
We're facing tough times, there's no doubt, but we're not facing them alone. Canada and the United States are each other's closest allies, most important trading partners, and oldest friends. And we stand united to beat this pandemic and build a better tomorrow. And I know our bond will grow even stronger.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Joe, for your leadership, for your engagement. And thank you in advance for all the great work we're going to be doing together. Merci beaucoup.
President Biden. Thank you, Justin. Au revoir. 
Prime Minister Trudeau. Bonsoir.","NOTE: The President spoke at 6:22 p.m. from the East Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were detained in China on December 10, 2018, and charged with stealing state secrets for a foreign organization.

23-Feb-21,Remarks Prior to a Virtual Meeting With Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada,"President Biden. Mr. Prime Minister, it's good to see you. And I wish I could reciprocate the hospitality you gave me when I visited Ottawa as Vice President in 2016. The sooner we get this pandemic under control, the better. And I look forward to seeing you in person in the future.
As you know, to state the obvious—we had a private talk about this a little while ago—the United States has no closer friend—no closer friend—than Canada. That's why you were my first call as President, my first bilateral meeting. And of course, my Vice President spent some time living up in Montreal for high school. And so our channel of communication is—are wide open.
As you know, we have a robust agenda today. And we're all best served when the United States and Canada work together and lead together in close coordination on a full range of issues we're going to discuss: COVID-19, economic recovery, climate change, refugees and migration, fighting for our democratic values on a global stage, and strengthening our own democracies at home.
We spoke about this at the G-7, but it's worth saying again: I believe the leaders of the major democracies, we have—as leaders of the major democracies, we have a responsibility to prove that democracy can still deliver for our people. There are a lot of leaders around the world who are trying to make the argument autocracy works better.
Empowering the full participation of our people, expanding opportunity and equity for everybody, ensuring the benefits of growth are shared broadly: that's how we're going to win the battle for the future.
So thank you again, Mr. Prime Minister, for your partnership and your enduring commitment to the U.S.-China relationship—U.S.-Canadian relationship. We're going to talk about China. And I'm looking forward to a very productive discussion.
The floor is yours, Mr. Prime Minister.
[At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke via videoconference from Ottawa, Canada.]
Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you very much, Mr. President. It's so good to see you, Joe. And it's such a great opportunity for us to sit down and talk not just about this extraordinary friendship between our two countries, but all the work we have to do together to get through COVID, but also to keep making sure we're pulling our weight around the world and making the world a better and safer place for everyone, not just with this pandemic, but with everything else as well.
It's a real pleasure to be able to see you today alongside Vice President Harris. I'm glad to be joined here by our Deputy Prime Minister, Chrystia Freeland, and our Foreign Minister, Marc Garneau, whose birthday it is today. So it's a special celebration for him.
Lots of things to talk about. Obviously, COVID and how we're going to keep our citizens safe is top of mind. But we're also going to dig into the recovery; how we move forward on creating good jobs for Canadians and Americans; strengthening the middle class; helping those working hard to join it. As we move forward, there's a lot to rebuild.
We're also going to talk about climate change. And thank you again for stepping up in such a big way on tackling climate change. U.S. leadership has been sorely missed over the past years. And I have to say, as we're preparing the joint rollout and communiqué from this one, it's nice when the Americans are not pulling out all references to climate change and, instead, adding them in.
So we're really excited to be working with you on that. Lots more to do.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and no translation was provided. He then continued in English as follows.]
I'm really looking forward to engaging with you all on these issues over the coming hours, but especially looking forward to getting to know your whole team as well.
Vice President Harris, it's great to see you here. I'll turn it over to you now.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. It is good to see you. It was good to speak to you on the 1st of February.
And as the President said, I spent many of my teenage years living in Montreal when my mother was teaching at McGill University and doing her research at the Jewish General Hospital there. So I have fond memories of my time in Montreal, and it certainly left me with a lasting impression about how much our two countries have in common in terms of shared values and priorities.
And as the President has said, we have a lot to do, each of us. And together we can do a lot of it in addressing COVID; in addressing the impact of the pandemic on our countries; looking at where we have possibilities to work together, not only in terms of the public health and economic struggles of our country, but also what we have in terms of shared values around addressing the challenges of climate change.
We look forward to working with you on that and many others. We are neighbors. We are friends, as a country. And the challenges that we face not only are, as we have said, about COVID and climate change; also, as the President will talk about and has mentioned, our challenges in terms of China and Russia and what we can do in terms of working together on that and working together in terms of strengthening and modernizing the U.N. and WTO.
So we look forward to working with you. It is good to speak with you. And I'll now turn it over to Deputy Prime Minister Freeland. And I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you.
[Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland spoke via videoconference from Ottawa, Canada.]
Deputy Prime Minister Freeland. Well, Madam Vice President, it gives me such pleasure to address that term directly to you. And I have to tell you, your election has been such an inspiration for women and girls across Canada, especially for Black women and girls and for South Asian women and girls. So many of them have told me that directly.
I am so looking forward to working with you and your administration on conquering COVID, on working together to be sure our economies can come roaring back.
I couldn't agree more with what the President says, that we have a real responsibility now—all of us—to show that democracy can deliver for our people: for Canadians, for Americans, and for the whole world. And with the friendship of everyone in this room, in that virtual room, I am pretty confident we're going to do it.
[Deputy Prime Minister Freeland spoke in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Madam Vice President, we are very proud of you, and all the women and girls in Canada are very proud of you, of course. And I do hope that once COVID is over, we will be able to meet in person. And indeed, French—I am, myself, an English speaker, and French is a difficult language to learn, but I do believe that is well worth it.
Vice President Harris. Moi aussi. Merci beaucoup. [Laughter]
President Biden. Well, before we go on, I want to make sure you know Antony Blinken, our Secretary of State, sitting here on the right. And the fellow down here on the right hand side is a guy named Jake Sullivan, and he's the National Security Adviser. And the National Security Council Senior Director for Western Hemisphere, Juan Gonzalez, who usually speaks Spanish to me, which I have trouble with as well.
I told you, Mr. Prime Minister, I took 5 years of French in school and college as well. And when I—every time I tried to speak it, I'd make such a fool of myself, I stopped trying. At least when I try Spanish and I make a fool of myself, they laugh with me. At any rate, thank you very much.

23-Feb-21,Remarks in a Virtual Roundtable Discussion With Black Essential Workers,"Domestic Policy Council Director Susan E. Rice. Good afternoon, and welcome. I'm Susan Rice, President Biden's Domestic Policy Adviser. It's great to be with you all and with President Biden. I help President Biden formulate and implement his domestic policy, and there's no greater priority than tackling the COVID-19 pandemic and rescuing our economy.
We're here today to hear directly from you, frontline workers and first responders who are doing the very vital work and have borne the weight of the COVID-19 pandemic. You are heroes, and your service we honor.
A disproportionate number of Black Americans serve as frontline workers and as first responders, putting yourselves at greater risk of contracting COVID-19. And one in four deaths from COVID-19 have been those of Black Americans. And so during this Black History Month, we wanted to say thank you, to lift up your voices and your service and your needs.
The President's American Rescue Plan, if passed by Congress, will bring an end to this pandemic, and it will invest in you and your fellow frontline workers and all Americans so we can keep ourselves safe and rebuild our economy so that it works for everyone.
Mr. President, joining us here today are Demetris Alfred—he goes by ""Al""—who is a——
The President. To me, he's ""Mr. President."" [Laughter]
Director Rice. Al is a firefighter and EMT in St. Louis, Missouri. And we have Melanie Owens, a pharmacist in Chicago; Carmen Palmer, a childcare worker in Columbus, Ohio; and Jeff Carter, a grocery store manager in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
Thank you all so much for being here today and for sharing your stories with us.
Mr. President, over to you.
The President. Well, thanks for joining us, everyone. I—you know, I know I've met Al before. And, Al, thank you for all the help in the past, and we're going to try to help, now, you and the firefighters and the EMTs.
And, Melanie, I understand you're the—what?—second- or third-generation pharmacist in your family? Is that right?
Walgreens Pharmacy Manager Melanie Owens in Chicago, IL. Yes.
The President. Well, that's pretty impressive. That's pretty impressive.
And, Carmen, you do God's work. You're dealing with all those little kids and trying to figure out how you do it now and how you can safely open and how you can make it work.
Kiddie Academy employee Carmen Palmer in Columbus, OH. [Inaudible]—it's a pleasure dealing with children.
The President. Well, I tell you what: We need you badly.
And, Jeff, you have too damn many Hy-Vees around the State. [Laughter] I mean, I tell you what—you know, I—it was always a debate whether I stop at a Hy-Vee or whether I find a frozen custard stand. But you know, that's what we did in Iowa. But all kidding aside, you all are—you're basically holding the country together. I'm not being facetious; I'm being deadly earnest. You can see the looks on people's faces when they walk into your drugstore and they stand at the counter and they ask for a prescription, can't you? You can see the fear in their eyes, as they—especially if they've gotten a—an unwelcome analysis, like two of your family members have, Al.
And so what I want to do today is, I want you to know—there's that old bad joke, ""I'm from the Federal Government; I'm here to help."" But we are from the Federal Government, and we want to help. We want to help a lot. There hasn't been—most States—you're from four different States, and you're—I mean, we've got St. Louis, Chicago, Columbus, and Cedar Rapids.
And so—and every State, as you know, has a slightly different approach to how to deal with COVID right now. And we're trying to make sure they get all that they need, each of those States. And we're focusing, as the—as the former Ambassador said, that we're focusing on the—on the needs, particularly of the most left-behind community: the African American community. I mean, it really is across the board, but on this area specifically, as, I might add, are the Latino communities being left behind—not as much, but similarly—and Pacific Islanders.
So there's a lot of work to do, and that's why we want to talk to you to see whether we're headed in the right direction. So I'm hear—I'm eager to hear what's on their mind, Susan, and see what you're thinking—what you think we should be doing.
And now I know the guy from Iowa, Jeff, he'll ask any questions, because Iowans are so spoiled; they can ask every Presidential candidate: ""Come on. Can you come over here and sit down with me for a few minutes? I want to talk to you."" Right, Jeff?
Hy-Vee Store Director Jeff Carter in Cedar Rapids, IA. Right.
The President. So, you know—I mean, so—but all kidding aside, I'm anxious to hear what's on your mind, what you think we should be doing, and then maybe, in the process, ask a few questions and tell you the kinds of things we're doing to try to deal with what are, we think—I hope—are the problems of the people who are keeping us floating.
You're the ones that keep us going. Not a joke. You are the ones that keep us going and kept the country going. You're carrying it on your back. And so thank you for what you've done so far. And we've got a lot more to do.
Director Rice. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to begin by introducing our first speaker, Demetris ""Al"" Alfred.
We'd actually like to hear from each of you about your experiences during COVID. But, Al, first I'd like to tell you—ask you to tell us about yourself. You're a 30-year firefighter and EMT in St. Louis. You're the president of your local union and president also of the Missouri State Council of Firefighters. You and your fellow workers have been through a great deal, and we'd love to hear your experiences over the last couple years.
The President. Before you start, you heard that old expression: ""God made man, and then he made a few firefighters."" [Laughter]
International Association of Fire Fighters, Paramedics, EMTs, and Dispatchers of St. Louis President Demetris ""Al"" Alfred. Yes, sir. Yes.
Well, thank you. Thank you. And good afternoon, Ambassador Rice and Mr. President. It's a pleasure to be here and an honor to be able to speak to you. And good to see you again, Mr. President.
The President. Good to see you.
Mr. Alfred. We have met before, and I enjoy your company every time.
Let me start out by saying: In St. Louis, the firefighters have had a tough time with COVID, going on calls. We've had to change up our direction on protocol a little bit, with masking up and 6-feet social distancing. We've even changed the protocol that when we go on medical runs and calls, people trapped in a house, and even fires—we approach them a little bit different. We have to wear face masks.
[Mr. Alfred continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
We just would like the support from Federal Government, local, and State to keep us afloat so we can have the equipment and things to keep us going to do our job. And we'll appreciate everything you guys can do for us.
The President. Al, let me ask you: If you had to identify the one thing—you could wave a wand—the one thing that could help your women and men and the firefighters and EMTs, what do you need the most?
Mr. Alfred. We would like to make certain that we could get the funding down to the local level and to the fire departments in particular, so, like I said, we can still purchase the PPE to sustain us, to get our equipment, and things like that. And most importantly, we'd like to get support so we wouldn't have the budget cuts or have to endure any pay cuts or layoffs. That's a big worry, because like I said, we respond to everything; we show up ready to go, very resourceful; and we adapt very well.
But then, after things are over, once the crisis has passed, it appears that sometimes the local government or management—however you want to look at it—find that the department may be easy to cut because the crisis is over. And that's our—that's one of our biggest concerns.
So if you ask me if I had a major wand—a magic wand, I would say that I'd wave that wand to make sure that we get the proper funding to sustain our jobs so we can respond and help the citizens of our community.
The President. Well, that's what we do in this legislation we put together. And I hope to God it's going to pass. We provide for resources—$350 billion for emergency funding for State, local, and territorial governments. Now, we've got 340 million people in America. We've got a big country.
And so what's happened is, a lot of States have decided that they—because they have to balance their budgets—they can't continue to spend the same amount of revenue they were spending before. And what's happening is a lot of—everything from firefighters to schoolteachers to a whole range of people are being laid off. We're short 6,000 teachers, firefighters.
And the only thing I know—working with your outfit, Al, for so long—is that the only thing keeps firefighters safe is more firefighters. Literally.
Mr. Alfred. Yes, sir.
The President. Literally. And so you're being cut. We also find—provide for $160 billion for supplies. And that would be everything from, you know, making sure we can scale vaccine distribution and testing, make sure everybody can get in there and have an opportunity to get the test to EMTs and firefighters. When we get that done, we're going to have one less crisis you have to deal with.
Mr. Alfred. Yes, sir.
The President. But look, the funds we're talking about are designed to keep teachers and school workers on the job, including childcare; invest in personal protective equipment. I understand, from the story I was told, that you have the personal protective equipment in St. Louis, but they don't have it in Kansas City—of the firefighters.
Mr. Alfred. Yes, sir.
The President. And also to reduce, you know, any—just increase capacity across the board. So, you know, we owe you a lot. My family owes you a particularly lot. You literally—as you know, when we talked, you saved my life. The EMTs in my State saved my life. Got me down to a hospital in time to save my life. And my boys; you saved their lives too, with the ""jaws of life"" much earlier. So we owe you big.
But what I want to do is make sure you—I get more specific with you and find out that—you know, whether or not you have access to get in line.
Last thing: States set the priorities for who gets the vaccine. We have now gone from having a shortage of vaccines to, by the end of July, we'll have over 600 million doses of vaccine, enough to take care of everybody in the country.
And we're moving as the—as Ms. Owens knows, we're moving to make sure that drugstores, pharmacies are going to be able to be a place—just like for flu shots—you can go. We've just gone from—because we find that that's more accessible to an awful lot of folks who are—don't have the means to travel very far, don't have the access to get to where they need to go. And they're used to their pharmacy, and they know their pharmacist, and they can get a shot.
And we've gone from this week—last week, 1 million doses to pharmacies to 2 million this week. So, with the grace of God and the good will of the neighbors, we're going to be able to significantly increase that.
And, Carmen, I'm pushing really hard for—I mean this sincerely—for daycares to be able to open, and you need financial help to open. You can't just open just straight up. And—but we'll talk about that a little bit as we go on. I don't want to take too much time at the front end here.
So look, Al, just—you know, don't be shy about letting us know what you need. And what you need in Missouri is not fundamentally different than what people need in Kansas and people need in Iowa and people need in Illinois, et cetera. So we ought to talk some more. Okay?
Mr. Alfred. Absolutely, Mr. President. And you know our favorite statement: We have your back.
The President. You have, man. As one of your guys said, ""You have my back so much, you're breaking my shoulders,"" pushing me. [Laughter]
Mr. Alfred. [Laughter] That's all right.
The President. Anyway, thank you, Al.
Director Rice. Well, Mr. President, next I'd like to introduce Melanie Owens. Melanie, as you know, is a pharmacist on the South Side of Chicago. Melanie actually contracted COVID herself last March and has now been vaccinated. And she's been administering vaccines to people in her community.
Melanie, please give us a sense of your story.
Ms. Owens. Hi, Mr. President. And thank you very much, Ambassador Rice. It is an honor and a privilege to be here with you. And thank you for allowing me to share a small part of my story. As she said, I am a pharmacist in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago—a pharmacy manager. And I began my career with Walgreens nearly 20 years ago, and it was the opportunity to help care for others in our communities that helped me become a pharmacist. And it didn't hurt that both of my parents are pharmacists as well. I also have a sister who is a nurse, and my brother-in-law is an engineer for the fire department. So we're all frontline workers.
[Ms. Owens continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
So, President Biden, please keep rolling out the vaccine because it is helping to keep people alive and safe. So with that, I just want to say thank you again for this opportunity. I never thought I'd be able to speak directly with the President of the United States and especially on Zoom. [Laughter] So thank you. Thank you so much for that.
The President. Well, thank you, Melanie. Look, let me ask you a couple questions.
You're in the South Side of Chicago; that's where my kids' grandparents are from.
Ms. Owens. Awesome.
The President. And they're—and you know, people are—you know, they don't have a whole lot of money. And a lot of people don't—and it's an older population these days.
Ms. Owens. Yes.
The President. And one of the things that I've observed is that there is a reluctance to—if they don't know how to get online with you—a lot of people don't know how to use that—they may not have a cell phone; they may not have the ability to know how to pick the phone up and get online. They just—and so, they're reluctant.
And what I found is—from the days when my dad was raising me—that sometimes people, when they don't know what to do, they're embarrassed to acknowledge they don't know how to do it. They don't know how to get it done.
So how important do you think it is—what—and one more piece of this. We also know, because of the way American medicine has taken advantage of African Americans for experimentation over the last hundred years, that there's a real reluctance that still exists in the African American community to get the vaccination, even if it's available. And my—I've been pleading with people, ""Get it."" If you have a chance, get it. It will save not only your life potentially, but it will save your family a little bit.
So tell me about what you've sensed. I can tell you have a feel for this. Tell me—no, I really mean it. Tell me what you sense from your patients who come in to get the shot. Is it—I don't think they're afraid of a needle. It's not like, ""Oh, a needle."" But are they reluctant to say—to deal with it? Or is it because you're an African American woman they respect, does that make it easier for them to be able to take the——
Ms. Owens. So I will say that my customer base, for the most part, is very excited. We haven't had many people come discussing whether or not we would get it ourselves or, you know, should they get it. It's more when can they get it. I was more reluctant than most people—[laughter]—most of my customers to get it, actually. But then, you know, it just kind of felt like an obligation when I started to go to long-term care facilities. You know, I'm here to protect them, so I needed it.
And you know, just listening to my parents, who are in their seventies, who were so eager to get it, and I was happy to be able to help them get it. You know, it just—it helped to change my mind. And I also had some administrative staff at the first long-term-care facility that I went to change their mind based on me changing mine, at that moment, to get it.
So, I mean, I think it's just—you can be fearful. You know, you can have questions. But you know, do your due diligence and figure out what is best for you. And you know, like I said earlier, this is going—if this is a part of or a major key of what's going to help us move past this and then go back to being able to live normally, I feel like we should do it. You know, it's no harm in it.
The President. Well, we've been able to increase the supply to the States, in just in the month we've been here, by 57 percent. So they're getting 57-percent more vaccine than they did before. And we're going to—God willing, we're going to be in a position where we can significantly increase that as well.
So that—and the other thing is, we have set up—and we made another Federal decision, saying that we were going to use community health facilities, which usually take care of the folks who are the most in need——
Ms. Owens. Yes.
The President. ——and because they know where—I'm not being facetious when I say this—they know where the people sleeping under the bridge are. They know where people who are really in real dire straits, who they're going out to get them, to get them vaccinated. And so we're hoping that this helps.
In addition, you know, one of the things we're going to be able to do is: Part of this investment is $20 billion in the National Vaccination Program. As you know, the funding helps deploy community vaccinators and vaccination centers. You're one of them. You're in the community. That's why—but some of the Governors were not sure that's the way to go, that we—and I'm not picking on any Governor. I really mean it.
They didn't understand why we made the independent decision to send vaccine directly to 600-and-some—or 600—67 different drug chains or drugstores out there—why we send it directly to them. And they weren't sure why we were sending directly to childcare facilities. That's what we're going to try to do now. And so—because they thought they could better decide where to use it.
But I am determined to make sure we service the communities that are the ones that are the most victimized by—""victimized,"" wrong word; most affected by—most affected by the COVID virus when they get it and the consequences of it.
But I thank you for all you do—and I really mean it—and for going to those—into those—those long-term care facilities and helping there as well. So thank you very much.
Ms. Owens. Thank you.
Director Rice. Thank you, Melanie.
Mr. President, our third participant, as you know, is Carmen Palmer. Carmen is a childcare worker in Columbus, Ohio. But—I say ""childcare worker,"" but that really doesn't do it justice. She does almost everything there is to do.
The President. That's what I read.
Director Rice. [Laughter] She runs a food program at the childcare center. She's a substitute teacher. She's a bus driver when needed. And she's also the mother of two of her own young children.
So, Carmen, we'd love to hear your story.
The President. You obviously have a lot of spare time, Carmen. [Laughter]
Ms. Palmer. Of course. I just, you know, wanted to tell you, you know, thank you, President Biden and Ambassador Rice, for, you know, speaking with me and giving me this opportunity. I do appreciate that. Again, I'm Carmen Palmer. You know, I'm born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. I grew up in foster care. And after graduating high school, that's when I decided, you know, for a better environment, and I moved to Ohio. And that's where I found my home here at Kiddie Academy. I've been working here 5 years, and as Ambassador Rice mentioned, my two children both attend the childcare facility.
[Ms. Palmer continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
Our enrollment is down, and we are seeing less of our families because of the pandemic. They're not working, and, you know, they're losing their jobs. And I'm just really grateful that I'm able to still work, you know, during the pandemic, and that's important to me to keep an employment. So——
Director Rice. Thank you, Carmen.
The President. Well, Carmen, look, you know, we—this legislation, which we think is going to pass, is going to help childcare providers by allowing you to pay the rent; pay your utilities; your payroll, if there is one beyond you—as a loan; as well as increased costs associated with the pandemic. And those costs include PPE; you mentioned ventilation—paying for ventilation improvement; small group sizes; modifications to make physical environment inside safer by providing more dividers.
We're also temporarily going to increase the Child Care Tax Credit. Right now, if you make over a certain amount of money, you will get a tax credit of 2,000 bucks now. We're going to raise that to $3,000 per child and $3,600 for a child under the age of 6 and make it refundable, which is the big deal. Because if you're not making a lot of money and not paying taxes—you may have two or three kids—you don't get any help at all.
But now what will happen is, if this passes, they will get a refundable credit for each child, if they're under 6—a $3,600 check from the Federal Government. And the same thing for the $2,000 and so on.
So they say we'll cut—if we get this done, it will cut child poverty in half. But in addition to that, it will provide those parents with access to not only your daycare center, but others across the country to be able to afford it.
And we're also making sure that we provide money for folks who are about to be thrown out of their homes, or you know, there's millions of people out there who can't pay the rent. And so we've deferred any cost to have to pay the rent while this pandemic is going on, because otherwise, you'd just have—we'd be vastly increasing the homeless population, which makes no sense.
And so, you know, we know how important early childhood education and a child's development is. And to get through this crisis, I think we need to be sure childcare providers have the funding they need to stay afloat.
And you mentioned something, Carmen, that is really important. You know, the—most of these kids you've been taking care of, if they were going to kindergarten or preschool, they'd be getting a free lunch program.
Ms. Palmer. Yes.
The President. Well, you know—well, we've got to increase the amount of money available for what used to be called the ""food stamp program,"" but it's not now. As—and—but we got to make more—make it available. Because did you ever think you'd see in your—anyone in your hometown where you'd see miles of cars lined up in multiple lanes, waiting for one box of food?
Ms. Palmer. No.
The President. This is United States of America, for God's sake. And the idea there is that much food insecurity is just not right.
So what—I believe if we get this bill passed—which we're not going to pass by a lot, but we're optimistic we're going to make some real changes. And the childcare centers are at risk of closing all around the country.
And what impact would it have—and the last question I'll ask—if you had to shut down, what do you think it would do to the children and the parents that you—that now are your clients?
Ms. Palmer. I mean, it will be—it would have a tremendous impact on our families. Our families are, you know, telling us now that they can't work, and it's definitely hard to find childcare if you don't have any employment.
The President. Yes.
Ms. Palmer. And even me, as myself, I honestly wouldn't know what I could do if I didn't have childcare so I could go to work. Because I have no family here; all my family is back home in Michigan.
The President. Yes. Okay, kiddo, keep doing what you're doing. You're——
Ms. Palmer. Thank you.
The President. You're really—as my mom would say, you're doing God's work, kid.
Ms. Palmer. [Laughter] Thank you, Mr. President.
Director Rice. Mr. President, Carmen is also the only one with young kids in school. And I thought it might be worth just asking her to say a few words about how her kids have fared in the pandemic with the virtual schooling and then, now, hybrid schooling.
The President. Are you able to take them to the daycare for the hybrid school?
Ms. Palmer. Yes. Yes, I am. I actually made the joke with Ambassador Rice yesterday on saying, like: ""I really fear for my youngest son. He's 7. He's a thumb sucker, and I for sure knew he was going to get COVID."" Because I'm like, ""You just keep—put your hands in your mouth."" But—so I—they—I put them in—enrolled them in virtual, and then my oldest daughter, she—her grades—you know, she started to struggle. So I was, like, ""Okay, you needed the help."" So I, you know, switched her over to hybrid. So on Mondays and Tuesdays, they attend school to get, like, the help they need—that one-on-one. And then, Wednesdays and Thursdays and Fridays, they attend the daycare.
And our, you know, teachers there are willing to, you know, help assist them, you know, with their hybrid learning. But you know, sometimes—you know, not even just my kids, but all the kids as well are dealing with their social and emotional needs of social distancing and really can't go anywhere but just school and home. So we have to, you know, deal with those aspects of the kids as well.
The President. Well, an awful lot of children, as well as adults, are going through some real—they need some help in terms of depression and mental problems. I mean, you know, they're just—we're worried about their—they're just so off. They don't know exactly what's going on, and it has real impacts. And that's why we got to get them back into school; that's why we have to open up these schools.
And by the way, the other—a lot of you out there are struggling just to make ends meet even if you have a job, and—but we're going to make sure you get that extra $1,400 check during the pandemic that both parties had said they support it. Even the past President said he strongly supported it. We just got to get it done now. But it will make a difference and give you some—just, literally, some breathing room just to be able to—just a little breathing room. That's what we need to give people right now. Because everybody in this shot, in this circumstance that is being hurt, it's through no fault of their own. It's not their fault that the pandemic started.
Well, thank you.
Ms. Palmer. Oh, you're welcome, Mr. President. Thank you.
Director Rice. Mr. President, last but by no means least, I wanted to introduce Jeff Carter. Jeff is the district store manager of two Hy-Vee grocery stores in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Jeff, we'd love to hear your story too.
Mr. Carter. Thank you very much, Mr. President and Ambassador Rice. I really appreciate the opportunity that I've been given to speak with you and, kind of, tell my story a little bit.
As I said, my name is Jeff Carter. I am married to my wife Kim Carter. We've been married for about 25 years. I do have an older son; his name is Mason. He works as a finance officer in one of the major car dealerships here in Cedar Rapids.
I work for Hy-Vee, and Hy-Vee is a grocery store chain in—we have stores in Iowa. And, as you mentioned, Mr. President, we have too many stores in Iowa, but we also have stores in Nebraska, Illinois, South Dakota, Missouri, Kansas, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. So we are——
The President. I know. I was teasing you. [Laughter]
Mr. Carter. [Laughter] I know. But it's—we're a great company, and I really have appreciated the opportunity that I have to work for them.
We employ over 88,000 employees. And during this past year, the pandemic has really challenged us to not only focus on service to our customers and our employees, but also safety. You know, we really had to shift our focus rapidly on how we take care of our customers, how we make sure that they are safe when they come into stores.
[Mr. Carter continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And through all that, you know, many of our employees—you know, some were a little bit, you know, concerned about going to work because they had, you know, maybe family members at home that had underlying health conditions that might put them at risk of catching the virus and possibly falling very sick or, worse, possibly death. But they still came to work to help serve our customers and do their job.
On top of that, in Cedar Rapids, on August 10, we had a major weather event called ""derecho"" that rolled through our city.
The President. That was amazing.
Mr. Carter. It was an amazing event that I had never, ever witnessed—that I'd never even heard the word ""derecho"" prior to that. We had winds of up to 120 miles an hour go through and destroy property and trees. Many trees were lost, and we're—in fact, they actually have a campaign right now where we are—as Hy-Vee, we are getting thousands of trees into the city and surrounding areas—that we can replace those trees that were lost.
[Mr. Carter continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And once again, I'm very—I very much appreciate this opportunity. It's like a dream come true, something I'll cherish for the rest of my life. And I'll probably watch this video over and over again. [Laughter] So thank you very much.
The President. Well, Jeff, it's an honor for the Ambassador and I to be—and me, to be able to talk you. Look, one of the things that the Ambassador and I made the decision early on, to quote Franklin Roosevelt, I'm going to give it to you ""straight from the shoulder."" I'm not going to play games. I'll tell you when we do it right, and I'll tell you when we screwed up and tell you we'll take responsibility. That's what I think all of you are doing. You're giving this straight to the people you're working with and to the people you're trying to help.
And we spent much too much time ignoring this. One of the things you've all mentioned is the PPE—the protective gear—and social distancing. And I know that that Melanie knows this, as a pharmacist, and all of you know it from your experience, that the way—we can save—we could have saved literally an awful lot of lives if people had listened. We turned wearing masks into a political statement—if you were for this thing, you'd wear it; if you're for somebody else, you didn't wear it—when, in fact, it's just plain, basic science. Science. Social distancing, so you're not coughing on one another—the particles. The ventilation you talked about, Carmen, makes a difference in community centers and the like.
And so there's so many things that we can do that are just within our own power. We're probably going to be sending out an awful lot of masks around the country, very shortly—millions of them. But the point is that you all—interesting, without my asking you—talked about the need to social distance. It's kind of hard to social distance in a fire truck. It's kind of hard to social distance in a—with an EMT in the back of a wagon. But you all know it's important. And so I hope you'll continue.
I had said, when I got elected, that in my first 100 days, I'd guarantee people we'd get at least 100 million shots in people's arms—100 million shots in people's arms. And 30 days in, we're about 40 percent of the way there. And what are we at? Forty-seven——
Director Rice. Almost 50 million, not quite.
The President. Almost 50 million right now. And we said we're going to do a million shots a day.
One of the things that you and Melanie know is that we had to get vaccinators. It's one thing to get a vaccine delivered; it's another thing to get it out of that vial, into a needle, and into somebody's arm. And so we worked very hard. We've probably gotten another—it's close to 4,000 people who give vaccinations, from National Guard, to the Defense Department, to others, and to units within commercial operations that can have people who can do the vaccination. I've signed an Executive order allowing former retired doctors and nurses to be able to come back and give vaccinations.
And so we're going to beat this thing because of folks like you. And to the extent you can continue to have your constituencies—and they're all different—is to make sure that they understand that social distancing matters, washing your hands matters, and the whole idea. And I don't have to tell you that, Al. You know, you had two kids affected, right?
Mr. Alfred. Y",,,,,,,,,,,,,
s, sir. Yes, sir. They're back doing pretty good. We're blessed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Well, thank God.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, but one of the things that—you know, again, I'm going to go back to the whole question of equity. What we're trying to do—my team and I—is get people who in fact have been most hurt by this pandemic to places where they are comfortable, where they have comfort in going. They don't feel like they are—they're not intimidated by the circumstance.,,,,,,,,,,,
And they're usually—they're used to going to the grocery store. They're used to going to their—to their drugstore or pharmacy. They're used to doing those things. But we also are trying to get out mobile units into communities—not only inner city, but rural communities—that don't have as much access. You know, I guess, they tell me the statistic is that the vast majority of the American people live within 5 miles of a pharmacy. Well, the point is that that may be case, but if you're an older person living by yourself, you don't have a vehicle, and there's no public transportation, it's awful hard to get to that pharmacy. So we're working out ways now to provide mobile transportation—literally vans going into communities—and people, you know, getting shots that are being administered by people who people tend to trust.,,,,,
So I'm glad—I can't tell you how much difference you're making. We've met with people all over the country via this means. And I think there's a growing awareness that, you know, injecting bleach into your system doesn't do it for you. [Laughter] And I'm being serious—I mean, think about it: all the ridiculous things. And there is online still—there are those who are the—you know, the vaccine——,,,,,,,,,,,
Director Rice. Deniers. Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. ——deniers, and telling all these stories about what's—that aren't true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So I really appreciate you and your colleagues across the country who are continuing to push and say: """"No. If you can get a vaccine", get it. And if you can get it," get it as quickly as you can. Socially distance.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
We're now doing a study. The COVID team, they're studying whether or not once you've had the vaccine and you've had it for the better part of several weeks—the last shot what can you do and not do, in terms of being sure that you are safe? Do you still wear a mask? Do you still socially distance, et cetera?,,,,,,,,,,,,
And so it's all—we're an administration that thinks science matters—science matters—and it has to be available to the poorest among us and those who are most hurt by this COVID crisis across the board. And that's what we're doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do you have any questions for me? Seriously," you can ask me anything you'd like. I can tell Carmen has a good question. I don't know. She's not sure. """"Should I really ask him that?"""" [Laughter] I don't know. You can ask me anything you want. I'm just Joe", okay? So fire away. Do you have a question?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ms. Palmer. When are you coming to see us in Columbus?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Well, I'm going to be back in Columbus. I was in Columbus—actually, now it's about literally 35 days or so ago. I came through in a whistle stop, in a train, when I was trying to get the nomination, when I was trying to win the election. But I like Columbus.,,,,,,,,,,
And I'm a Democrat, but I think your Governor is doing a pretty decent job of trying to get things going. I'm—you know, I don't think there's anything political about this. Some folks are just stepping up, and he's stepped up in my—my impression. We disagree on things. We used to serve together. I like him. But it's not a—I just think this is about—it's about the science.,,,,,,,,,,,,
But when I come back, you know, if you see me, you better not say," """"Joe"," who?"""" Okay? [Laughter] """"Who is that guy? Joe"," who? What was that guy's name?""""",,,,,,,,,
Ms. Palmer. [Inaudible]—stop by the Academy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. [Laughter] Well, I'll you what, I'd like—I hope I can be—get to the point where that's happened.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now, the one thing I get most asked is when it's going to go back to normal. The honest to God truth is, I can't tell you that. But most experts tell you that things are going to be—continue to change and change somewhat rapidly. I think you're going to see that, next fall, it's going to be different than last fall. I think you're going to see that we're going to be going into the Christmas season better than we were. Whether it's back to complete normal, I don't know. But we're going to beat this. I promise you we are going to, together, beat this.,,,,,,,,
And I think that, I—you know, but the idea that over 500—I think it's—I have a card. I carry a card with me every day and—with the total number of folks who have been affected by the—as of yesterday, there are 500,071 people who have died from this—500. That's more people that died in World War I, World War II, and Vietnam combined, in a year—in a year.,,,,,,,,
But look, when the American people set their minds to something, there's nothing—nothing—we've been unable to do if we do it together. So with your help—and there's so darn many—you know, we—look—look at all the stuff that's, I don't know, bad or disappointing out there, but there's so darn many good, decent, honorable people in this country, and they want to get it done right.,,,,,,
And so, in the meantime, make me one promise: You all take care of yourselves. We need you, for real. We need you, for real, okay?,,,,,,,,,,

22-Feb-21,"Remarks on Remembering the 500,000 Americans Lost to COVID-19","Each day, I receive a small card in my pocket that I carry with me in my schedule. It shows the number of Americans who have been infected by or died from COVID-19. Today we mark a truly grim, heartbreaking milestone: 500,071 dead. That's more Americans who have died in one year in this pandemic than in World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam war combined. That's more lives lost to this virus than any other nation on Earth.
But as we acknowledge the scale of this mass death in America, we remember each person and the life they lived. They're people we knew. They're people we feel like we knew. Read the obituaries and remembrances. The son who called his mom every night just to check in. The father's daughter who lit up his world. The best friend who was always there. The nurse—the nurse and nurses—but the nurse who made her patients want to live.
I was in—just in Kalamazoo, Michigan, at the Pfizer vaccine manufacturing facility. There I met a man when I walked in whose father-in-law was dying of the virus. He was sad. I asked if I could call his father-in-law. He said his father-in-law was too sick to speak. But then, he said, but could I pray for him—could I pray for him.
We all know someone—fellow Americans who lived lives of struggle, of purpose, and of hope; who talked late into the night about their dreams; who wore the uniform, born to serve; who loved, prayed, and always offered a hand.
We often hear people described as ""ordinary Americans."" There's no such thing; there's nothing ordinary about them. The people we lost were extraordinary. They spanned generations, born in America, immigrated to America. But just like that, so many of them took final breath alone in America.
As a nation, we can't accept such a cruel fate. While we have been fighting this pandemic for so long, we have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow. We have to resist viewing each life as a statistic or a blur or on the news. And we must do so to honor the dead, but equally important, care for the living and those they left behind.
For the loved ones left behind, I know all too well; I know what it's like to not be there when it happens. I know what it's like when you are there, holding their hands. There's a look in your eye, and they slip away. That black hole in your chest, you feel like you're being sucked into it. The survivor's remorse. The anger. The questions of faith in your soul.
For some of you, it's been a year, a month, a week, a day, even an hour. And I know that when you stare at that empty chair around the kitchen table, it brings it all back, no matter how long ago it happened, as if it just happened that moment you looked at that empty chair. The birthdays, the anniversaries, the holidays without them. And the everyday things—the small things, the tiny things—that you miss the most. That scent when you open the closet. That park you go by that you used to stroll in. That movie theater where you met. The morning coffee you shared together. The bend in his smile. The perfect pitch to her laugh.
I received a letter from a daughter whose father died of COVID-19 on Easter Sunday last year. She and her children—his grandchildren—enter Lent this season, a season of reflection and renewal, with heavy hearts. Unable to properly mourn, she asked me in the letter, ""What was our loss among so many others?""
Well, that's what has been so cruel. So many of the rituals that help us cope, that help us honor those we loved, haven't been available to us. The final rites with family gathered around. The proper homegoing, showered with stories and love. Tribal leaders passing out [without]* the final traditions of sacred cultures on sacred lands.
As a nation, we cannot—and we must—not let this go on. That's why the day before my Inauguration, at the COVID-19 Memorial at the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall, I said to heal—to heal—we must remember. I know it's hard. I promise you, I know it's hard; I remember. But that's how you heal: You have to remember. And it's also important to do that as a nation.
For those who have lost loved ones, this is what I know: They're never truly gone. They'll always be part of your heart. I know this as well—and it seems unbelievable, but I promise you—the day will come when the memory of the loved one you lost will bring a smile to your lips before a tear to your eye. It will come. I promise you. My prayer for you though is that day will come sooner rather than later. And that's when you know you're going to be okay—you're going to be okay.
And for me, the way through sorrow and grief is to find purpose. I don't know how many of you have lost someone a while ago and are wondering: ""Is he or she proud of me now? Is this what they want me to do?"" I know that's how I feel. And we can find purpose, purpose worthy of the lives they lived and worthy of the country we love.
So today I ask all Americans to remember: Remember those we lost and those who are left behind. But as we remember—as we all remember, I also ask us to act. To remain vigilant, to stay socially distanced, to mask up, get vaccinated when it's your turn. We must end the politics and misinformation that's divided families, communities, and the country, and has cost too many lives already. It's not Democrats and Republicans who are dying from the virus. It's our fellow Americans. It's our neighbors and our friends, our mothers, our fathers, our sons, our daughters, husbands, wives.
We have to fight this together, as one people, as the United States of America. That's the only way we're going to beat this virus, I promise you. The only way to spare more pain and more loss—the only way these millstones no longer mark our national mourning—these milestones, I should say—no longer mark our national mourning. Let this not be a story of how far we fell, but of how far we climbed back up. We can do this.
For in this year of profound loss, we have seen profound courage from all of you on the frontlines. I know the stress, the trauma, the grief you carry. But you give us hope. You keep us going. You remind us that we do take care of our own. That we leave nobody behind. And that while we've been humbled, we have never given up. We are America. We can and will do this.
In just a few minutes, Jill and I, Kamala and Doug, will hold a moment of silence here in the White House: the People's House, your house. We ask you to join us to remember, so we can heal; to find purpose in the work ahead; to show that there is light in the darkness.
This Nation will smile again. This Nation will know sunny days again. This Nation will know joy again. And as we do, we'll remember each person we've lost, the lives they lived, the loved ones they left behind. We will get through this, I promise you. But my heart aches for you—those of you who are going through it right now.
May God bless you all, particularly those who have lost someone. God bless you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 6:01 p.m. in the Cross Hall at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Douglas C. Emhoff, husband of Vice President Kamala D. Harris.

22-Feb-21,Remarks on Federal Aid to Small Businesses,"Good afternoon. I just had an opportunity to catch up with two small-business owners I met on the road in the last couple weeks. And the first was a very entrepreneurial woman named Pilar Guzman Zavala, and she's from Florida, Miami. And Tim Eichinger, who is in Wisconsin. They have different businesses and live in different places, but both shared the same message with me when I spoke to them on the road, and that was, American small businesses are hurting and hurting badly, and they need help now. And it's in all of our interests to make sure they get the help now.
Small businesses are the engines of our economic progress; they're the glue and the heart and soul of our communities. But they're getting crushed. Since the beginning of this pandemic, 400,000 small businesses have closed—400,000—and millions more are hanging by a thread.
It's hurting Black, Latino, and Asian American communities the hardest. Walk down any Main Street and you see it: empty storefronts, goodbye signs hanging in the windows. Maybe it's the pizza place you used to take your family to dinner or the hardware store that always had the tool you needed. It's mom-and-pop shop that's sponsored by—that is supported by the community, and then, in turn, they support the community. They sponsor Little League teams; the barbershop with the first dollar bill that he or she earned is still taped to the wall, along with a picture of the kids who are now in college.
These small businesses—not the ones with 500 employees, but these small businesses that, with a handful of folks, they are 90 percent of the businesses in America. But when the Paycheck Protection Program was passed, a lot of these mom-and-pop business just got muscled out of the way by bigger companies who jumped in front of the line.
And I want to be clear: The Paycheck Protection Program is a bipartisan effort; Democrats and Republicans helped pass it. But Democrats and Republicans have also voiced concerns about improving it. With their input, that's what we're doing in our administration: improving it.
In the last month, we've increased the share of funding for small businesses with fewer than 10 employees by nearly 60 percent. For businesses in rural communities, the share of funding is up nearly 30 percent since we came to office. And the share of funding distributed through banks that traditionally help minority-owned businesses is up more than 40 percent.
And today I'm announcing additional changes to the PPP program that will make sure we look out for the mom-and-pop business even more than we already have. As I explained to Pilar and Tim—the two small-business people I spoke to—on Wednesday, the Small Business Administration is going to establish a 14-day exclusive PPP loan application period for businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 20 employees. People can go out and find how to get a hold of these loans. People can find out more at the SBA.gov.
The Small Business Administration will also remove barriers that have stopped many businesses from being able to apply for these loans. For example, we're making it so that a student loan default or a non-fraud-related criminal record does not prohibit someone from applying for the program. We're also making it easy for those one-person businesses—like the home repair contractors; beauticians; small, independent retailers—to secure forgivable PPP loans. At the same time, we're increasing access by increasing oversight. I invite any inspector general in this program, with jurisdiction over this program, to closely look at these loans and report—publicly report—on any issues they uncover inconsistent with what I'm saying today. We will ensure every dollar is spent well. These changes will bring much-needed, long-overdue to—help to small businesses who really need help staying open, maintaining jobs, and making ends meet. And this is a starting point, not the ending point.
We need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan. It deals with the immediate crisis facing our small businesses. Now, critics say the plan is too big. Let me ask them a rhetorical question: What would you have me cut? What would you leave out? The American Rescue Plan targets $50 billion to support the hardest hit small businesses after this program expires at the end of March. Would you not help invest in them? Would you let them continue to go under? Would you leave them out again, like the previous administration did?
One of the things I've heard again and again from small-business owners like Pilar and Tim is that knowing about support is one thing; being—gaining access to getting it is another. That's why we proposed $175 million to bring community organizations in to serve as ""navigators"" who will help them through this process of application. We would also establish a hotline, with help available in multiple languages so folks can pick up a phone and get the help they need to stay open and serve their community.
Again, the critics: ""It's too big."" Should we not—should we stop spending money on them? Do we not want a return on investment that we make in these businesses to be able to stay open and thrive and pay back? Why would we not want to make sure small businesses, who lack teams of lawyers, bankers, and accountants, have an advocate—someone they can rely on—to direct them to help that's there for them now—will be there for them?
The American Rescue Plan is a rescue plan for America's small businesses and America's mainstream businesses. And we need Congress to pass it right away. I'm grateful to the Senate and the House for moving so quickly.
And I want to make it clear: I'm prepared to hear ideas about how to make the American Rescue Plan better and cheaper. But we have to make clear who we're helping and who it would hurt. I always try to help people like Tim and Pilar and all the country's small businesses, and families, the workers, the communities that depend on them to survive, recover, and grow.
And it's my hope—my hope—that as Democrats and Republicans, who have backed the PPP program—that Democrats and Republicans will back the American Rescue Plan. The vast majority of the American people—more than 70 percent of the American people, including a majority of Republicans—want us to act based on all the polling data and act big and act quickly.
Major economists—left, right, and center—here and abroad say we should focus on smart investments that can make jobs available and focus on the jobs and in the people to prevent long-term economic damage to our Nation and to strengthen the economic competitiveness going forward. In fact, an analysis by Wall Street's firm Moody's estimates that if we pass my American Rescue Plan, the economy will create 7 million jobs this year. This year.
We've also been in constant contact with the mayors and Governors, county officials, Members of Congress of both parties in every State. That includes a letter, I might add, from more than 400 mayors from big and small cities, Democrat and Republican. They agree we have to act and act now. They understand we're not going to get our economy back in shape and the millions of people back to work until we beat this virus.
Getting our economy back means bringing our small businesses back. And that's what we're going to do. That's what I'm doing today. We're going to focus. The program ends at the end of March, but for the next 2 weeks, the only folks who can apply for that PPP money are businesses with fewer than 20 employees.
Thank you very much.","NOTE: The President spoke at 12:29 p.m. in the South Court Auditorium of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building.

19-Feb-21,"Remarks at a Pfizer Incorporated Manufacturing Facility and an Exchange With Reporters in Kalamazoo, Michigan","The President. Albert, thank you very much. Thank you not only for what you do for the—the credit you give me that I really don't deserve. This is a case of life and death. We're talking about people's lives.
I want you to know that once we beat COVID, we're going to do everything we can to end cancer as we know it. I've asked Dr. Eric Lander, a renowned Harvard/MIT scientist, to co-lead the Presidential Council of Advisers in Science and Technology and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. These are the White House offices that bring together the country's top scientists and address our most pressing needs.
They'll be part of the administration's work to develop a DARPA-like advanced research effort on cancer and other diseases, just like there is DARPA in the Defense Department that develops the breakthroughs to protect our country.
This administration is going to be guided by science: to save lives and to make lives better. And that's why I wanted to come here, Albert, to thank you and to thank all the workers here in Kalamazoo. And I'm here to thank my good friend, Governor Whitmer, and she has become a good and close friend. The Governor has been on the frontlines of this pandemic, as well, for a long time, and I think she's doing an incredible job under very difficult circumstances.
And Michigan is also fortunate to have my buddy Gary Peters as United States Senator and Debbie Stabenow. Gary is here. Gary has been a workhorse in making sure that we move through this funding to get things done, because he understands better than anyone: It's about urgency, the urgency of the moment. So, Gary—thank you, Senator. Thank you for all you're doing.
Last week, I toured the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. I met world-class doctors, scientists, and researchers who were critical for discovering the vaccines in record time. I remember when we first started talking about this, asking Dr. Fauci and others. They said, ""Well, it could take up to several years, maybe as many as 6 or 8 years, to find a vaccine."" It's a miracle of science and the brilliant minds that we have around us.
And now it's a second miracle—a miracle of manufacturing—to produce hundreds of millions of doses. Let me say that again: hundreds of millions of doses. I came here because I want the American people to understand the extraordinary—extraordinary—work that's being done to undertake the most difficult operational challenge this Nation has ever faced.
And let me say parenthetically that it's not enough that we find cures for Americans. There needs to be cures that the world is able to take part of, because you can't build a wall or a fence high enough to keep a pandemic out.
On our tour, I met a few of your nearly 3,000 workers, Albert: experts managing ingredients that come in from different cities and States; experts handling 3-D modeling and artificial intelligence to ensure that every dose is properly crafted; experts ensuring a sterile environment so that each vial—each and every one—is safe and free of contaminants.
All of this is followed by extensive safety and quality control inspection, then careful packaging and labeling. We walked by a freezer farm that then keeps those doses viable so they can be shipped. This is an incredibly complex process. And at every stop, safety is the utmost priority.
The whole process takes teamwork, precision, and round-the-clock focus. Machinists operating some of the most advanced equipment in the world, working side by side with chemists, biologists, pioneering technologies that, less than a year ago, were little more than theories and aspirations.
And it takes a partnership, in our view, between the Federal Government and all of the companies and universities contributing to the vaccine effort.
Just over 4 weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country. My predecessor—as my mother would say, ""God love him""—failed to order enough vaccines, failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office.
I directed Jeff Zients, my COVID-19 Response Coordinator, to lead my administration's work with the vaccine manufacturers to buy more vaccines and to speed up delivery. Albert referenced it earlier, and I want to thank him for making it happen. Because we worked together, we're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for all Americans by the end of July. And it doesn't mean that it will be in all Americans' arms, but enough vaccine will be available by that time. These orders allow facilities like this one to plan ahead, accelerate their production schedules.
Here's what else we did: When we discovered that vaccine manufacturers weren't being prioritized when it came to scrutinizing and securing supplies they needed, we fixed that problem and got them what they needed. We also used the Defense Production Act to speed up the supply chain for key equipment, like fill pumps and filters, which has already helped increase vaccine production. In fact, on our tour today, they showed me a critical piece of machinery they didn't have before; now, they do. And it's allowing them to ramp up production.
And as we increase supply, we're carrying out a clear plan to get shots into the arms of 300 million Americans or more. And I know people want confidence that it's safe. Well, I just toured, and that's—where it's being made. It takes more time to do the check for safety than it does to actually make the vaccine. That's how fastidious they are.
And listen to Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci assured me the COVID-9 [COVID-19]* vaccines were safe. That's why, several weeks ago, I went through the rigorous scientific review. That's why I took my vaccine shot publicly to demonstrate to the American people that I know and believe it's safe. That's why Vice President Harris also received her shot publicly.
We all know there is some history—there's some hesitancy about taking this vaccine. We all know there's a history in this country of having subjected certain communities to terrible medical abuses in the past. But if there's one message to cut through to everyone in this country, it's this: The vaccines are safe. Please, for yourself, your family, your community, this country, take the vaccine when it's your turn and available. That's how to beat this pandemic.
And we're making progress. We deployed more vaccinators, the people who put the vaccine in your arm. We're now making it possible for retired doctors and nurses to come back and, under the law, administer these shots. We've put new vaccinators in the field. These include over 800 medical personnel from our Commissioned Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services and personnel from the Federal Emergency Management Agency—FEMA—Defense Department, National Guard. We're literally lining up—we're lining up thousands of vaccinators, because it's one thing to have the vaccine, and it's very different to get it in someone's arms.
We're also creating more places for people to get vaccinated. We've provided $3 billion to States, Territories, and Tribes to create hundreds of new vaccination centers to ramp up—and ramp up the existing ones that now—that are there.
Right here in Michigan, with Governor Whitmer, FEMA has provided tens of millions of dollars to bolster the State's community vaccination centers, from the National Guard at the Expo Center here in Kalamazoo, to the TF—excuse me, the TCF Center in Detroit, to parking lots and churches across the State.
We've worked with Governors in California, Texas, New York, and more to come, to stand up massive mass vaccine sites in stadiums that will be open 24/7 and arenas and community centers. It's an effort that's on top of the federal government covering the full cost for the states' use of their National Guards for pandemic efforts. And you suggested I do that a while ago, and I promised you I'd do it, and we did it.
We also started shipping vaccines directly to thousands of local pharmacies across the country so eligible folks can get the COVID-19 shot like they would a flu shot. Here in Michigan, that's already more than 220 pharmacies, like Rite Aid and Meijers, in more than 130 Michigan cities. And that's just the beginning. It's only been 4 weeks.
And for folks who aren't near a pharmacy or a mass vaccination center, we're deploying mobile clinics. These are special vehicles and pop-up clinics that meet folks where they live, folks who don't have access to transportation to get the shots. We're also supplying vaccines to community health centers—Federal community health centers—to reach those who are hit the hardest: Black, Latinos, Native Americans, and rural communities, which have higher rates of COVID infections and deaths than any other group.
Here in Michigan, we're already partnering with community health centers, serving more than 370,000 patients in 11 cities across the State. That's because you guys have pointed out where they were, why it was so important, and how we get to—as Gary talks about, get to—the people most in need and the people most dying from COVID. This is important to ensure everyone is treated equally and those hardest hit get the care they deserve.
We're now at a point where we've seen the average daily number of people vaccinated nearly double, from the week before I took office, to about 1.7 million average per day getting a shot. We're on track to surpass my commitment. You may remember when I said, ""In my first 100 days,"" just before I was inaugurated—which seemed like 100 days. But anyway, ""The first 100 days,"" before I was inaugurated, ""that we'd administer 100 million shots in my first 100 days."" But we're on the path to do that. We're averaging 1.7 million a day. Soon we'll be at 50 million, and I'm confident we'll exceed the number. But that's just the floor. We have to keep going.
But despite the progress, we're still in the teeth of a pandemic. New strains are emerging. In a few days, we'll cross 500,000 Americans who will have died from COVID-19. Five hundred thousand. That is almost 70,000 more than all the Americans who died in World War II, over a 4-year period. All the sorrow, all the heartache, all the pain.
And while we wait for everyone to get vaccinated, we still need you to wash your hands, stay socially distanced, and mask up to help save lives. That's why, with the authority I have as President, I signed an Executive order—the only authority I have to require this—to require masking on all Federal property, all modes of travel like planes, trains, and buses. And we've been calling on Governors and mayors and local officials—Republicans and Democrats—to institute mask mandates within their jurisdictions, just like Governor Whitmer has done here in Michigan.
Look, I know it's inconvenient, but you're making a difference when you do it. Everything we do matters. We need everyone to do their part for themselves, for their loved ones, and yes, for your country. It's a patriotic duty.
We need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan that deals with the immediate crisis—the urgency. Now, critics say my plan is too big, that it costs $1.9 trillion. So that's too much. Well, let me ask them: What would they have me cut? What would they have me leave out? Should we not invest $20 billion to vaccinate the Nation? Should we not invest $290 million [billion]* to extend unemployment insurance for the 11 million Americans who are unemployed so they can get by while they get back to work? Should we not invest $50 billion to help small businesses stay open, when tens of thousands have had to close permanently? Should we not invest—and by the way, they make up half the employment in America. Should we not invest $130 million [billion]* to help schools across the Nation open safely?
Right now 24 million adults, 11 million children don't have enough food to eat. And unless you think I'm exaggerating, think of those scenes you've seen on the television with cars lined up, which seemed like miles, to wait to have someone put a box of food in their trunk. People never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever thought they would need help, and through no fault of their own, they're in that circumstance.
If we don't pass the American Rescue Plan, 40 million Americans will lose [some of their]* nutritional assistance through a program we call SNAP, the old food stamp program. Do we not invest $3 million—$3 billion to keep families from going hungry?
One in five Americans are behind on their rent. One in ten are being on their mortgages. How many people do you know that will go to bed tonight staring at the ceiling, saying: ""God, what is going to happen if I don't get my job, if I don't have my unemployment check? What's happened to me? I'm losing my health insurance. What do I do?""
This is the United States of America, for God's sake. We invest in people who are in need. Do we not invest $35 billion to help people keep a roof over their heads? I could go on, but you get the point. I'm grateful that the Senate and the House are moving quickly. And I'm prepared to hear their ideas on how to make the package better and make it cheaper. I'm open to that.
But we have to make clear who is helped and who is hurt. And my hope is that the Republicans in Congress listen to their constituents. According to the polls, there is overwhelming bipartisan support. The vast majority of the American people—more than 70 percent of the American people, with all the polls you all conduct, including a majority of Republicans—want us to act, and act big and quickly and support the plan.
Major economists—left, right, and center—say we should focus on smart investments we can make now in jobs, in our people to prevent long-term economic damage to our Nation and to strengthen the economic competitiveness going forward. In fact, an analysis by the Wall Street firm Moody's estimates that if we pass my American Rescue Plan, the economy will create 7 million jobs this year. This year.
We've also been in constant contact with mayors and Governors, county officials, Members of Congress—both parties. Both parties. I've met with them in my office; I've met with them in—on the internet—on—Zooming on with them. Both parties in every State. And guess what? They agree we have to act now.
I got a letter from more than 400 mayors, from big cities and small towns. They understand we're not going to get our economy back in shape and the millions of people back to work until we beat this virus.
That's why the American Rescue Plan puts 160 million—billion dollars into more testing and tracing, manufacturing and distribution, and setting up vaccination sites—everything that's needed to get vaccines into people's arms, which is the most difficult logistical effort the United States has undertaken in peace time. It includes $4 billion for new manufacturing plants so we're ready to manufacture vaccines in the future and we don't have to wait.
I'm going to close with what I said before: I'll always be straight with you. I said in my Inaugural I'll be—""give it to you straight from the shoulders,"" Roosevelt said. Because the American people can take the truth. They can handle anything. I can't give you a date when this crisis will end, but I can tell you we're doing everything possible to have that day come sooner rather than later.
And all of you here are doing some of the most important work in this facility, right here, that can be done. And I know this is personal: I walked in today, and I won't say who came up to me, but one of the people in this building came up to me and said, ""My father-in-law is dying from COVID."" I said, ""Can I call?"" He said: ""No. He couldn't take a call."" He says, ""Keep him in his prayers, please.""
How many of you know somebody who's in real trouble or has passed? How many people do you know who sat down to breakfast this morning and looked at an empty chair across the table? You've seen the devastation of this virus in your family, your community, but you're stepping up. You're saving lives here: lives of your loved ones, your neighbors, your fellow Americans. You're showing how this town, this State, this country takes care of our own, leaves nobody behind.
We can do anything when we do it together. I believe we're on the road. And I promise you, I know we'll run into bumps. It's not going to be easy here to the end, but we're going to beat this. We're going to beat this.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Albert, thank you and your people for all you do.
Pfizer Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you.
Coronavirus Vaccine Distribution and Access/School Reopening Efforts 
Q. President Biden, you've said that you think by the end of July is when we'll have enough vaccines for all Americans. But when do you think all Americans, or a majority, will have actually gotten the vaccine?
The President. Well, all you've got to do is —do a little bit of the math. Getting the vaccine and having it available is not the same as putting it in someone's arms. This is going to be a continuous rolling effort. So we'll have had—we will have ordered, much of which will have been distributed, over 600 million doses by the end of July. July 29 is the expected date. But that could change. Look at what's happening with the weather now, for example: It's slowing up the distribution right now. But I believe we'll be approaching normalcy by the end of this year. And God willing, this Christmas will be different than last. But I can't make that commitment to you. There are other strains of the virus. We don't know what could happen in terms of production rates. Things can change. But we're doing everything the science has indicated we should do, and people are stepping up to get everything done that has to be done.
We're going to have debates about whether or not—for example, I can't set nationally who gets in line when and first. That's a decision the States make. I can recommend. I can say what I've said—like, I'm the guy that said we should lower it to 65 years of age. I think 35 States have done that or more. I think that—for example, I think it's critically important to get our kids back to school. I think it's really important because of the psychological damage being done and the loss of time. A kid loses a semester when they're in fifth grade—it means they're not just a semester behind; they may be a year and a half behind. All of the difficulty.
You were at that town meeting I had with that little girl who was worried that, you know, her mommy—told her mommy she worried maybe she's going to die. So there's a lot. I think it's important we get people back in school.
There's a difference, for example, according to the science now, between kids between the ages of 3 and probably 12 years old, in terms of whether they can absorb and/or communicate the disease than it is for kids who are 15, 16, 17, and 18 years old who congregate more together. It's harder in a high school than it is in a grammar school.
We know certain things are necessary: social distancing, smaller class sizes, ventilation, testing, and the possibility that staff, whether it's the staff taking care of the sanitary conditions in the school or simply—you've heard me say this before—bus drivers. To open the schools, we need more buses and bus drivers. We can't put kids packed in a bus, sitting next to one another.
So we know the things that have to be done. The question is the order in which we do them is going to—determined on what moves the quickest and where the need is the greatest. Obviously, we still have to focus on first responders, our doctors, our nurses, those delivering the services.
But the reason I bother to bore you with that detail is to try to explain to the American people that this is a process, but we know now the fundamental basic elements. The fundamental basic elements are that, before you get the shot and after—if you get the shots and after—social distancing save lives, wearing masks saves lives, making sure that you wash your hands with hot water saves lives. This is not hyperbole. This is not a political statement. It's a reality. The science has demonstrated that.
We also know that it's one thing to have a vaccine available. The problem was, how do you get into people's arms? There's not enough people to vaccinate. All the great hospitals in this State, and in my State, they can line up and give people, but they can't possibly handle the volume that is needed. So what do you do? You get more people qualified to give vaccinations. The quicker you can open up places and that people can come up and demonstrate they're on—on the pecking order and they're ready for their shot, and they're qualified—keeping places open 24/7 makes a lot of sense, but you need people to do it.
So we all know the basic things that have to happen. Now, we also know that there are things that intervene. Things happen. Weather. People get ill. People get confused. There's a lot of people who don't—aren't able.
You know, I—you've heard me say before—you know, my little granddaughter can use that cell phone of hers to do more in about 12 seconds than I can do it in an hour. But a lot of people aren't able to, a lot of people who need the help. They say, ""Well, get online."" Well, they don't have the means to get online. They might not have, you know, the ability to get online, and they may not know how to do it.
Talk about—everybody is—you know, most people are within 5 miles of a pharmacy. Well, if you're living alone and you're a 68-year-old woman, and you're in a minority neighborhood, and there's no bus service, you might as well be 500 miles away. That's why we're leading now—and, Gary, you talked to me about it—getting mobile vans to go out.
So we know the kinds of things that have to be done. But there has never ever, ever, ever been a logistical challenge as consequence—as consequential as we're trying to do. But we're getting it done. And as my mom would say, with the grace of God and the good will of neighbors, we're going to save a lot of lives.
Thank you very much.","NOTE: The President spoke at 3:24 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to Sen. Deborah A. Stabenow; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S.

19-Feb-21,"Remarks at the Munich Security Conference ""Special Edition 2021"" and an Exchange With Reporters","[The President spoke from the White House via videoconference.]
The President. Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. And it's great to be with Angela and Emmanuel. We just spent part of—from Washington's perspective—the morning together. But I want to say hello to everyone and thanks, you—at the Munich Conference for hosting this special session.
For decades, as you pointed out, I've participated in the Munich Security Conference—as a U.S. Senator, joining my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to affirm the importance of the transatlantic partnership; three times as the Vice President of the United States, including delivering the first international foreign policy address of the Obama-Biden administration in the first months we were in office.
And 2 years ago, as you pointed out, when I last spoke at Munich, I was a private citizen; I was a professor, not an elected official. But I said at that time, ""We will be back."" And I'm a man of my word. America is back.
I speak to you today as President of the United States at the very start of my administration, and I'm sending a clear message to the world: America is back. The transatlantic alliance is back. And we are not looking backward; we are looking forward, together.
It comes down to this: The transatlantic alliance is a strong foundation—the strong foundation—on which our collective security and our shared prosperity are built. The partnership between Europe and the United States, in my view, is and must remain the cornerstone of all that we hope to accomplish in the 21st century, just as we did in the 20th century.
The challenges we face today are different. We're at an inflection point. When I spoke to you as a Senator and as even as Vice President, the global dynamics have shifted. New crises demand our attention. And we cannot focus only on the competition among countries that threaten to divide the world or only on global challenges that threaten to sink us all together if we fail to cooperate. We must do both, working in lockstep with our allies and partners.
So let me erase any lingering doubt: The United States will work closely with our European Union partners and the capitals across the continent—from Rome to Riga—to meet the range of shared challenges we face.
We continue to support the goal of a Europe whole and free and at peace. The United States is fully committed to our NATO alliance, and I welcome your—Europe's growing investment in the military capabilities that enable our shared defense.
You know, to me and to the United States, and to us, we'll keep article—we'll keep faith with article 5. It's a guarantee. An attack on one is an attack on all. That is our unshakable vow. And the only time article 5 has been invoked was after the United States was attacked on 9/11. You, our allies, joined us to fight Al Qaida, and the United States committed to consulting closely with our NATO allies and partners on the way forward in Afghanistan.
My administration strongly supports the diplomatic process that's underway and to bring an end to this war that is closing out 20 years. We remain committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again provides a base for terrorist attacks against the United States and our partners and our interests.
Our European partners have also stood with us to counter ISIS. Just this week, NATO Defense Ministers endorsed a significant expanded training-and-advisory mission in Iraq, which will be vital to the ongoing fight against ISIS. We cannot allow ISIS to reopen and regroup and threaten people in the Middle East, in Europe, in the United States, and elsewhere.
And while the United States is undergoing a thorough review of our own force posture around the world, I've ordered the halting of withdrawal of American troops from Germany. I'm also lifting the cap imposed by the previous administration on the number of U.S. forces able to be based in Germany.
I know the past few years have strained and tested our transatlantic relationship, but the United States is determined—determined—to reengage with Europe, to consult with you, to earn back our position of trusted leadership. Earlier today, as was referenced, I participated in the first meeting of the G-7 leaders, where I spoke about the dire need to coordinate multilateral action to address COVID-19, the global economic crisis, and the accelerating climate crisis, and so much else.
Achieving these goals is going to depend on a core strategic proposition, and that is: The United States must renew America's enduring advantages so that we can meet today's challenges from a position of strength. That means building back better our economic foundations, reclaiming our place in international institutions, lifting up our values at home and speaking out to defend them around the world, modernizing our military capabilities while leading with diplomacy, revitalizing America's network of alliances and partnerships that have made the world safer for all people.
You know, I hope our fellow democracies are going to join us in this vital work. Our partnerships have endured and grown through the years because they are rooted in the richness of our shared democratic values. They're not transactional. They're not extractive. They're built on a vision of a future where every voice matters, where the rights of all are protected and the rule of law is upheld.
None of this has fully succeeded in this—none of us has fully succeeded in this division [vision]*. We continue to work toward it. And in so many places, including in Europe and the United States, democratic progress is under assault.
I have known for—I've known many of you for a long, long time, and you know that I speak my mind, so let me be straightforward with you all: We are in the midst of a fundamental debate about the future and direction of our world. We're at an inflection point between those who argue that, given all the challenges we face—from the fourth industrial revolution to a global pandemic—that autocracy is the best way forward, they argue, and those who understand that democracy is essential—essential—to meeting those challenges.
Historians are going to examine and write about this moment as an inflection point, as I said. And I believe that—every ounce of my being—that democracy will and must prevail. We must demonstrate that democracy can still deliver for our people in this changed world. That, in my view, is our galvanizing mission.
Democracy doesn't happen by accident. We have to defend it, fight for it, strengthen it, renew it. We have to prove that our model isn't a relic of history, it's the single best way to revitalize the promise of our future. And if we work together with our democratic partners, with strength and confidence, I know we'll meet every challenge and outpace every challenger.
You know, we must prepare together for long-term strategic competition with China. How the United States, Europe, and Asia work together to secure the peace and defend our shared values and advance our prosperity across the Pacific will be among the most consequential efforts we undertake. Competition with China is going to be stiff. That's what I expect, and that's what I welcome, because I believe in the global system Europe and the United States, together with our allies in the Indo-Pacific, worked so hard to build over the last 70 years.
We can own the race for the future. But to do so, we have to be clear eyed about the historic investments and partnerships that this will require. We have to protect—we have to protect—for space for innovation, for intellectual property, and the creative genius that thrives with the free exchange of ideas in open, democratic societies. We have to ensure that the benefits of growth are shared broadly and equitably, not just by a few.
We have to push back against the Chinese Government's economic abuses and coercion that undercut the foundations of the international economic system. Everyone—everyone—must play by the same rules. U.S. and European companies are required to publicly disclose corporate governance—to corporate governance structures and abide by rules to deter corruption and monopolistic practices. Chinese companies should be held to the same standard.
We must shape the rules that will govern the advance of technology and the norms of behavior in cyberspace, artificial intelligence, biotechnology so that they are used to lift people up, not used to pin them down. We must stand up for the democratic values that make it possible for us to accomplish any of this, pushing back against those who would monopolize and normalize repression.
You know, this is also how we're going to be able to meet the threat from Russia. The Kremlin attacks our democracies and weaponizes corruption to try to undermine our system of governance. Russian leaders want people to think that our system is more corrupt or as corrupt as theirs. But the world knows that isn't true, including Russians—Russia's own citizens.
Putin seeks to weaken European—the European project and our NATO alliance. He wants to undermine the transatlantic unity and our resolve, because it's so much easier for the Kremlin to bully and threaten individual states than it is to negotiate with a strong and closely united transatlantic community.
That's why standing up for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine remains a vital concern for Europe and the United States. That's why addressing recklessness—Russian recklessness—and hacking into computer networks, in the United States and across Europe and the world, has become critical to protecting our collective security. The challenges with Russia may be different than the ones with China, but they're just as real.
And it's not about pitting East against West. It's not about, we want a conflict. We want a future where all nations are able to freely determine their own path without a threat of violence or coercion. We cannot and must not return to the reflective [reflexive]* opposition and rigid blocs of the cold war. Competition must not lock out cooperation on issues that affect us all. For example, we must cooperate if we're going to defeat COVID-19 everywhere.
My first Presidential national security memorandum focused on surging health and humanitarian responses to defeat COVID-19 and to better prevent and prepare for the next pandemic. Today I'm announcing that the United States is making a $2 billion pledge to COVAX, with the promise of an additional $2 billion to urge others to step up as well.
Yet, even as we fight to get out of the teeth of this pandemic, the resurgence of Ebola in Africa is a stark reminder that we must simultaneously work to finally finance health security, strengthen global health systems, and create early warning systems to prevent, detect, and respond to future biological threats, because they will keep coming. We have to work together to strengthen and reform the World Health Organization. We need a U.N. system focused on biological threats that can move quickly to trigger action.
Similarly, we can no longer delay or do the bare minimum to address climate change. This is a global, existential crisis, and we'll all suffer—we will all suffer—the consequences if we fail. We have to rapidly accelerate our commitments to aggressively curb our emissions and to hold one another accountable for meeting our goals and increasing our ambitions.
That's why, as President, I immediately rejoined the Paris Agreement, and as of today, the United States is officially once again a party to the Paris Agreement, which we helped put together. On Earth Day, I will host a leaders' summit to help drive more ambitious actions among top emitters, including domestic climate action here in the United States.
I am grateful—I'm grateful—for Europe's continued leadership on climate issues over the last 4 years. Together, we need to invest in the technological innovations that are going to power our clean energy futures and enable us to build clean energy solutions to global markets.
The threat of nuclear proliferation also continues to require careful diplomacy and cooperation among us. We need transparency and communication to minimize the risk of strategic misunderstanding or mistakes. That's why the United States and Russia, notwithstanding other competition, extended the New START Treaty for an additional 4 [5]* years once I came—I was sworn in.
That's why we have said we're prepared to reengage in negotiations with the P5-plus-1 on Iran's nuclear program. We must also address Iran's destabilizing activities across the Middle East, and we're going to work in close cooperation with our European and other partners as we proceed. We'll also work together to lock down fissile and radiological material to prevent terrorist groups from acquiring or using them.
Look, the range of challenges Europe and the United States must take on together is broad and complex. And I'm eager to hear next from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel, about her thoughts on the way forward together.
So let me conclude with this: We cannot allow self-doubt to hinder our ability to engage each other or the larger world. The last 4 years have been hard. But Europe and the United States have to lead with confidence once more, with faith in our capacities, a commitment to our own renewal, with trust in one another and the ability of Europe and the United States to meet any challenge to secure our futures together.
I know we can do this. We've done it before. Just yesterday—after a 7-month, 300-million mile journey—NASA successfully landed the Perseverance rover on Mars. It's on a mission of exploration, with elements contributed by our European partners, to seek evidence of the possibility of life beyond our planet and the mysteries of the universe.
Over the next few years—""Percy"", as it's being called—the Perseverance will range and collect samples from the Red Planet and pile them up so another mission and rover, envisioned as a joint effort between NASA and the European Space Agency, will retrieve this trove of scientific wonders and bring it home to all of us.
That's what we can do together. If our unbound capacity to carry us to Mars and back don't tell us anything else, they tell us we can meet any challenge we can face on Earth. We have everything we need. And I want you to know the United States will do—we'll do our part. We'll stand with you. We'll fight for our shared values. We'll meet the challenges of this new moment in history.
America is back. So let's get together and demonstrate to our great, great grandchildren, when they read about us, that democracy—democracy—democracy functions and works, and together, there is nothing we can't do. So let's get working.
Thank you all very much. Thank you, folks.
[At this point, the President's concluded his virtual remarks and answered questions from reporters in the room as follows.]
Severe Winter Storms in Texas 
Q. Mr. President—[inaudible]—the Texas Governor's request for a major disaster declaration?
The President. Yes, I had a chance to speak with the Governor again last night, and I asked him whether he was about to ask for another effort to—because the circumstances Texas finds itself in—whether he was going to seek additional assistance. And we talked—I talked with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA—the Administrator. This afternoon I'm going to ask him to accelerate our response and request for, quote—it's a different declaration—a ""major disaster declaration"" so that we can get everything done that we need that's possible to get done with Federal Government help.
FEMA is already there and providing support—generators, diesel fuel, water, blankets, and other supplies. But I've directed Health and Human Services—HHS—Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense to identify other resources—other resources that can provide and address the growing needs of the folks in Texas.
And as a little bit along the lines I was just talking about, when any State—as I said when I ran, I'm going to be a President for all of America—all—red, blue; there's no red or blue. It's all about commitment to—the American people make to one another. And so we're going to sign that declaration once it's in front of me. And God willing, it will bring a lot of relief to a lot of Texans.
And so thank you all so very much.
The President's Travel Schedule 
Q. Do you have any plans to visit Texas, Mr. President?
The President. Say again.
Q. Do you have any plans to visit Texas?
The President. It depends. The answer is yes. The question is, I had planned on being in Texas the middle of next week, but what I don't want to be is a burden. When the President lands in any city in America, it creates—there's a—it has a long tail. And they're working like the devil to take care of their folks. If in fact it's concluded that I can do it without creating a burden for the folks on the ground while they're dealing with this crisis, I plan on going. But I'll—we'll know that—we'll make that decision probably the beginning of next week.
Okay? Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 11:17 a.m. from the East Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman, Munich Security Conference, who introduced the President; Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany; President Emmanuel Macron of France; President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia; Gov.

17-Feb-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Labor Leaders To Discuss Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Everybody, come on in. Don't get hurt.
Every once in a while, as President, you get to invite close friends into the Oval. [Laughter] I was kidding these guys before.
This is American labor. And I said from the beginning of my campaign, throughout my whole career: The middle class built this country, and labor built the middle class. And I think we have an incredible opportunity to make some enormous progress in creating jobs—good-paying jobs, Davis-Bacon, prevailing wage jobs—to rebuild the infrastructure of this country in a way that everybody knows has to be done.
I promised these—and a lot of these folks have been my friends for a long, long, long time. As they say in parts of my State, ""These are the folks that brung me to the dance."" And I appreciate their friendship.
And as I said—when some of you were in here when I was with the business community, I said I want to make it clear I'm a labor guy, and there's no reason why it's inconsistent with business growing either.
So what we're doing here today, we're—I asked them to come in—we want to talk about the recovery act we have here that we're trying to pass—and I think it's going to get done—and building infrastructure in this country.
We are so far behind the curve. We rank something like 38th in the world in terms of our infrastructure—everything from canals to highways to airports to—everything we can do, and we need to do, to make ourselves competitive in the 21st century.
And so the Vice President and I are looking forward to this meeting, and we're going to have a good conversation. And I think, you know, American workers and the whole economy is going to grow in a way that we haven't seen it grow in a long time. This is the time for us to move.
So, at any rate, I'll let you know. We're going to have a long conversation here. I don't know how long, but we're going to have a conversation as long as they're willing to put up with me, and talk about how we're going to get this done.
So thank you all for coming in.
Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, what did you learn from Americans last night about what they want in this plan?
The President. I learned, based on the polling data, they want everything that's in the plan. Not a joke. Everything that's in the plan. I—the fact is that I'd like to—I asked a rhetorical question: Those who oppose the plan, what don't they like? What particular program don't they like? Don't they want to help people with nutrition? Don't they want to help people be able to pay their mortgages? Don't they want to help people get their unemployment insurance? Don't they want to make sure that people are able to stay in their homes without being thrown out of their homes in the middle of this god-awful pandemic? What don't they like? And—but the truth of the matter is, the polling data from last night, and all the polls you've all done—they come from you guys; not you personally, but your networks and your organizations—show that somewhere between 64 and 69 percent of the American people think we have to do this. And it's not about the money; it's about in order to do everything from open schools, as we should, to make sure that we're generating income for people who are in real trouble. It's about how much it costs. The Federal Government has to chip in, make sure we get this done.
And as I said, almost every major economist in the country, and International Monetary Fund as well, says it's going to grow the economy. And that's what we're talking about here. We're going to talk about how we grow the economy.
So thank you all for coming. Appreciate it. Appreciate it. Thank you very much.

16-Feb-21,"Remarks and a Question-and-Answer Session at a CNN Presidential Town Hall in Milwaukee, Wisconsin","CNN Anchor Anderson Cooper. And welcome. We are live in the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This is a CNN Presidential town hall, the first with President Joe Biden. I'm Anderson Cooper. President Biden is just 4 weeks into his Presidency and facing multiple crises: nearly 500,000 of our fellow citizens—Americans—have died from COVID-19, millions out of work right now, and a nation dangerously divided.
Tonight we're going to be answering questions from the American people. The President will be answering questions from the American people on his first official trip since taking office. Some of the questioners here voted for him. Some did not.
The President and I will not be wearing masks on this stage. He, of course, has been vaccinated. Over the past several weeks, I have repeatedly tested negative for coronavirus—as recently as yesterday and this morning as well. We will however be keeping our distance from one another, and the audience is very limited, socially distanced, and all wearing masks when they're seated.
With that, I want to welcome the 46th President of the United States, President Joe Biden.
The President. Hey, Anderson.
Mr. Cooper. How are you, sir?
The President. Good to see you, man. Hey, folks. How are you? It's good to be back, man.
Mr. Cooper. Yes, it's nice to see you, sir.
The President. And you know you enjoy being home with the baby more. I don't want to hear this.
Mr. Cooper. [Laughter] I do. Yes. He's 9½ months, so I'm very happy.
The President. I get it. No, no, everybody knows I like kids better than people. [Laughter]
Mr. Cooper. I saw a picture of you with your grandson recently.
The President. That's right. That's right.
Mr. Cooper. Yes. So we've got a lot of questions in the audience. We have about 50 or so people here. They're all socially distanced. We have some folks who voted for you, some folks who did not. And we're going to get as many questions in as possible.
Before we get to that, I just want to start with a couple of just big-picture questions about the pandemic and where we are right now.
The President. Sure.
Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Mr. Cooper. New cases of COVID-19 hospitalizations have fallen by half in the last month, so have new cases. That's the good news. There's this potential threat—potential surge from the variants coming down the pike potentially. When is every American who wants it going to be able to get a vaccine? The President. By the end of July of this year. We have—when we came into office, there was only 50 million doses that were available. We have now—by the end of July, we'll have over 600 million doses, enough to vaccinate every single American.
Mr. Cooper. When you say ""by the end of July,"" do you mean that they will be available or that people will have been able to actually get them? Because Dr. Fauci——
The President. They'll be available.
Mr. Cooper. They'll be available.
The President. They'll be available.
Mr. Cooper. Okay.
The President. Here, look, we—what we did—we got into office and found out the supply—there was no backlog. I mean, there was nothing in the refrigerator, figuratively and literally speaking, and there were 10 million doses a day that were available.
We've upped that, in the first 3 weeks that we were in office, to significantly more than that. We've moved out—went to the Pfizer and Moderna and said, ""Can you produce more vaccine and more rapidly?"" They not only agreed to go from 200 to 400—then they've agreed to go to 600 million doses. And that's—and they're—and we got them to move up the time because we used the national Defense Act to be able to help the manufacturing piece of it to get more equipment and so on.
Mr. Cooper. So if, end of April—excuse me, end of July, they're available to actually get them in the arms of people who want them, that will take—what?—a couple more months?
The President. Well, no, a lot will be being vaccinated in the meantime.
Mr. Cooper. Okay.
The President. In other words, it's not all of a sudden 600 million doses are going to appear. And what's going to happen is: It's going to continue to increase as we move along, and we'll have reached 400 million by the end of May and 600 million by the middle of—by the end of July.
And the biggest thing, though, as you remember when you and I—no, I shouldn't say it that way, ""as you remember""—but when you and I talked last, we talked about—it's one thing to have the vaccine, which we didn't have when we came into office, but a vaccinator—how do you get the vaccine into someone's arm? So you need the paraphernalia. You need the needle, and you need mechanisms to be able to get it in. You have to have people who can inject it into people's arms.
Mr. Cooper. That's been one of the problems is just getting enough people.
The President. Yes, now we have—we have made significant strides increasing the number of vaccinators. I've—I issued an Executive order allowing former retired docs and nurses to do it. We have over 1,000 military personnel. The CDC is—I mean, excuse me, the—we have gotten the National Guard engaged.
So we have significant number of vaccinators, people who would actually be there. Plus, we've opened up a considerable number of locations where you can get the vaccination.
Mr. Cooper. I want to introduce you to Kevin Michel. He's an Independent from Wauwatosa. He's a mechanical engineer for a vehicle company.
Kevin, welcome. What's your question?
Q. Hi, welcome to Milwaukee.
The President. How you doing?
Q. Good. My question is regarding education.
The President. Yes.
School Reopening Efforts 
Q. And considering that hybrid and virtual school instruction have been in place for nearly a year now, what is the plan and recommendation to get students back into the brick-and-mortar buildings? As a parent of four children, I find it imperative that they get back to school as safely as possible.
The President. My mother would say: ""God bless you, son. No purgatory for you""—four kids home. I really mean it. And by the way, the loss of being able to be in school is having significant impact on the children and parents as well.
And so, what we found out is, there are certain things that make it rational and easy to go back to the brick-and-mortar building. One, first of all, making sure everybody is wearing protective gear—it's available to students, as well as to teachers, the janitors, the people who work in the cafeteria, the bus drivers.
Secondly, organizing in smaller pods, which means that's why we need more teachers. Instead of a classroom of 30 kids in it, you have three classes in that same—of 10 kids each in those. And I'm making the number up—less. It doesn't have to be literally 10.
In addition to that, we also have indicated that it is much better, it's much easier to send kids K-through-8 back because they are less likely to communicate the disease to somebody else. But because kids in—sophomores, juniors, and seniors in high school—they socialize a lot more, and they're older, and they transmit more than young kids do, it's harder to get those schools open without having everything from new ventilation systems and having——
For example, school bus drivers—you know, we've got to make sure that you don't have 60 kids, or however many there—depending on the size of school bus—sitting two abreast in every single seat.
And so there's a lot of things we can do, short of—and I think that we should be vaccinating teachers. We should move them up in the hierarchy as well.
Mr. Cooper. Well, let me ask you, you—your administration had set a goal to open the majority of schools in your first 100 days. You're now saying that means those schools may only be open for at least 1 day a week.
The President. No, that's not true. That's what was reported, but that's not true.
Mr. Cooper. Oh.
The President. There was a mistake in the communication. But what I've—what I'm talking about is I said opening the majority of schools in K-through-eighth grade because they're the easiest to open, the most needed to be opened, in terms of the impact on children and families having to stay home.
Mr. Cooper. So when do you think that would be: K-through-8, at least 5 days a week if possible?
The President. I think we'll be close to that at the end of the first 100 days. We've had a significant percentage of them being able to be opened. My guess is, they're going to probably be pushing to open all for—all summer—to continue like it's a different semester—to try to catch up.
Mr. Cooper. Do you think that would be 5 days a week or just a couple?
The President. I think many of them, 5 days a week. The goal will be 5 days a week. Now, it's going to be harder to open up the high schools for the reasons I said—just like, if you notice, the contagion factor in colleges is much higher than it is in high schools or grade schools.
Mr. Cooper. I want you to meet—this is Justin Belot. He's a high school teacher from Milwaukee who's a Democrat. Justin, thanks for being with us. What's your question?
The President. What do you teach?
Q. I teach English. High school English.
The President. My wife teaches. God love you, fella.
School Reopening Efforts/Vaccination of School Staff 
Q. Wonderful. Thank you, Mr. President. So along the same lines of schools, so this great debate on when to transition to in-person learning: While there are numerous warnings not to be in large groups or to have dinner parties or small parties, why is it okay to put students and teachers in close proximity to each other for an entire day, day after day? With large class sizes and outdated ventilation systems, how and when do you propose this to occur? And finally, do you believe all staff should be vaccinated before doing so?
The President. Number one, nobody is suggesting, including the CDC in this recent out report, that you have large classes, congested classes. It's smaller classes; more ventilation; making sure that everybody has masks and is socially distanced, meaning you have less—fewer students in one room; making sure that everyone from the sanitation workers who work in the—in the lavatories, in the bathrooms, and do the—all the maintenance, that they are in fact able to be protected as well. Making sure you're in a situation where you don't have the congregation of a lot of people—as I said, including the school bus, including getting on a school bus.
So it's about needing to be able to socially distance, smaller classes, more protection. And I think that teachers and the folks who work in the school—the cafeteria workers and others——should be on the list of preferred to get a vaccination.
Mr. Cooper. I want to introduce you to Kerri Engebrecht, an Independent from Oak Creek.
Kerri, welcome. Go ahead.
Q. Thank you.
The President. Kerri, how are you?
Coronavirus Vaccine Accessibility/Johnson and Johnson Vaccine Development 
Q. Very good, thank you. Our 19-year-old son was diagnosed with pediatric COPD at the age of 14. We're told he has the lungs of a 60-year-old. He does all he can to protect himself. Last month, he even removed himself from the campus of UW-Madison, as he feels it's safer and he has less exposure here at home.
We've tried all we can to get him a vaccine. I hear of others who are less vulnerable getting it based on far less. Do you have a plan to vaccinate those who are most vulnerable sooner, to give them a priority?
The President. Well, the answer is: Yes, there are. But here's how it works: The States make the decision on who is—or in what order. I can make recommendations, and for Federal programs, I can do that as President of the United States. But I can't tell the State, ""You must move such and such a group of people up.""
But here's what I'd like to do: If you're willing, I'll stay around after this is over, and maybe we can talk a few minutes and see if I can get you some help.
Mr. Cooper. Let me just ask you though: Johnson and Johnson could be authorized—a new vaccine from them could be authorized in a couple of weeks. That would be a big deal——
The President. Yes, it would.
Mr. Cooper. ——bringing a lot more vaccines on, millions of more doses to the supply. Once that happens, given the urgency of these variants and the potential threat from them, should states stop giving priority to certain groups and just open vaccine access for everyone?
The President. Well, it depends on how much they have available. I think there still should be priority groups in case there are not enough for everyone, every—available to everybody.
And look, we don't know for certain. Let me tell you what my national COVID team has said: that the variants—I mean by ""variants,"" you mean the Brazilian strain, the South African strain, the British strain——
Mr. Cooper. London. Yes.
The President. ——and London, et cetera. There's thus far—thus far—there is no evidence that the existing vaccinations available for Moderna and Pfizer do not either make sure that they apply—they work as well against the strain in the United States. And there is no evidence that they're not helpful.
So if you can get a vaccination, get it whenever you can get it, regardless of the other strains that are out there. There are studies going on to determine it is not only more communicable, but are there vaccine—do the vaccines not provide helpful protection by getting the vaccine. There are some speculation. I shouldn't—I've got to be very careful, right?—because millions of people are watching this. It may be that a certain vaccination for a certain strain may reduce from 95 percent to a lower percentage of certainty that it will keep you from getting——
Mr. Cooper. It may not be as effective as——
The President. It may not be as effective.
Mr. Cooper. ——against a variant, but it still would be effective.
The President. It'd still be effective. So the clear notion is: If you're eligible, if it's available, get the vaccine. Get the vaccine.
Mr. Cooper. I want you to meet—this is Dessie Levy, a Democrat from Milwaukee. She's a registered nurse, former academic dean. She's also currently director of a faith-based nonprofit.
Dessie, welcome.
The President. By the way—you've heard me say this before, Becky [Dessie]*—if there's any angels in heaven, they're all nurses, male and female. Doctors let you live, nurses make you want to live. I can tell you as a consumer of health care—my family. You're wonderful. Thank you for what you do.
Coronavirus Vaccine Deployment/Vaccine Accessibility in African American and Hispanic Communities 
Q. God bless you. Mr. President, hello. My name is Dr. Dessie Levy. And my question to you is: Considering COVID-19 and its significant impact on Black Americans, especially here in Milwaukee, and thus the exacerbation of our racial disparities in health care, we have seen less than 3 percent of Blacks and less than 5 percent of Hispanics, given the total number of vaccines that have been administered to this point. Is this a priority for the Biden administration? And how will the disparities be addressed? And that's both locally and nationally.
The President. Well, first of all, it is a priority, number one.
Number two, there's two reasons for it being the way it is. Number one, there is some history of Blacks being used as guinea pigs and other experiments—I need not tell you, Doctor—over the last 50 to 75 to 100 years in America. So there's a—there is a concern about getting the vaccine, whether it's available or not.
But the biggest part of it is access, physical access. That's why, last week, I opened up—I met with the Black Caucus in the United States Congress and agreed that I would—all of the Federal—all of the community health centers now, which take care of the toughest of the toughest neighborhoods in terms of illness, they are going to get a million doses, you know, a week, in how we're going to move forward, because they're in the neighborhood.
Secondly, we have opened up—and I'm making sure that there's doses of vaccine for over 6,700 pharmacies, because almost everyone lives within—not always walking distance, but within the distance of being able to go to the pharmacy, like when you got your flu shot. That is also now being opened.
Thirdly, I also am providing for mobile vans, mobile units to go into neighborhoods that are hard to get to because people are on—for example, even though everyone is within, you know, basically 5 miles of a Walgreens, let's say, the fact is, if you're 70 years old, you don't have a vehicle, and you live in a tough neighborhood—meaning you're—it's a high concentration of COVID—you're not likely to be able to walk 5 miles to go get a vaccine.
The other thing we found is—and I'm sorry to go on, but this is really important to me. The other part—portion is, a lot of people don't know how to register. Not everybody in the community—in the Hispanic and the African American community, particularly in rural areas that are distant and/or inner-city districts—know how to use—know how to get online to determine how to get in line for that COVID vaccination at the Walgreens or at the particular store.
So we're also—I've committed to spend a billion dollars on public education to help people figure out how they can get in there. That's why we're also trying to set up mass vaccination centers, like places in stadiums and the like.
Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Mr. Cooper. Are you concerned about the rollout of this online? Because it has been incredibly confusing for a lot of people, not just——
The President. Sure.
Mr. Cooper. ——you know, older people. It's younger people just trying to find a place to get a vaccine.
The President. Yes. And I have. Because look what we inherited: We inherited a circumstance here, where—and now for the first—we did a lot in the first 2 weeks—a circumstance where, number one, there weren't many vaccinators. You didn't know where you could go get a vaccine administered to you because there was no one to put it in your arm—number one.
Number two, there was very little Federal guidance; it's to say, what to look for, how to find out where, in fact, you could go. You can go online, and every single State now has a slightly different mechanism by which they say who's qualified, where you can get the vaccines, and so on.
So it's all about trying to more rationalize in detail so ordinary people, like me, can understand. I mean that sincerely. I mean, I'm not—my—you know, my grandchildren can use that online—you know, make me look like I'm in, you know, the seventh century. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, so this is a process, and it's going to take time. It took us a—think of what we didn't do. And you and I talked about this during the campaign. What we didn't do from the time it hit the—it hit the United States. ""You're going to inject something in your arm, it's going to go away."" ""You're going to be in—it will all be done by Easter.""
We wasted so much time. So much time.
Mr. Cooper. I have another question about vaccines. This is Jessica Salas. She's an Independent from the Milwaukee, a graphic designer.
Jessica, welcome.
Coronavirus Transmissibility Among Children 
Q. Hi, thank you. As we've been talking about, the coronavirus is very real and very scary. And it's especially scary for children who may or may not understand. My children, Layla—eight, here—and my son Matteo—seven, at home—often ask if they will catch COVID, and if they do, will they die. They are watching as others get the vaccine, and they would like to know when will kids be able to get the vaccine.
The President. Well first of all, honey—what's your first name?
Q. Layla.
Mr. Cooper. Layla.
The President. Layla. Beautiful name. First of all, kids don't get the vaccine—get COVID very often. It's unusual for that to happen. They don't—they—and there—the evidence so far is, children aren't the people most likely to get COVID, number one.
Number two, we haven't even done tests yet on children as to whether or not the certain vaccines would work or not work, or what is needed. So that's—so you—you're the safest group of people in the whole world, number one.
Number two, you're not likely to be able to be exposed to something and spread it to mommy or daddy. And it's not likely mommy and daddy are able to spread it to you either. So I wouldn't worry about it, baby. I promise you. But I know it's, kind of, worrisome. What—are you in first grade, second grade?
Q. Second.
The President. Oh, you're getting old. [Laughter] Second grade. Well, has your school—have you been in school, honey?
Q. No.
Q. No, we're—
The President. No. See, that's—that's, kind of, a scary thing too: You don't get to go to school; you don't get to see your friends.
And so what a lot of kids—and I mean—and big people too, older people—they just—their whole lives have, sort of, changed, like when it used to be. It used to be, let's go outside and play with your friends and get in the school bus and go to school, and everything was normal. And now, when things change, people get really worried and scared. But don't be scared, honey. Don't be scared. You're going to be fine. And we're going to make sure mommy is fine too.
Federal Coronavirus Response/Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Mr. Cooper. You know, let me ask you—let me ask you, just for folks who are watching out there—there are a lot of people who are scared, and there's a lot of people——
The President. Sure.
Mr. Cooper. ——who are hurting. When do you think this pandemic is—I mean, when are we—when is it going to be done? When are we going to get back to normal?
The President. Well, you know, all the experts, all the committee that I put together of the leading researchers in the world and in the United States who are on this committee of mine, headed by Dr. Fauci and others, they tell me: Be careful not to predict things that you don't know for certain what's going to happen because then you'll be held accountable. I get that.
But let me tell you what I think based on all that I've learned and all that I've studied and all that I think that I know. It's fairly—it's a high probability that the vaccinations that are available today—and the new one, Johnson and Johnson, God willing, will prove to be useful—that with those vaccinations, the ability to continue to spread the disease is going to diminish considerably because of what they call ""herd immunity."" And now they're saying somewhere around 70 percent of the people have to constitute; some people said 50, 60. But a significant number have to be in a position where they are—they have been vaccinated and/or they've been through it and——
Mr. Cooper. Have antibodies.
The President. And have antibodies.
And so, if that works that way—as my mother would say, with the grace of God and the good will of the neighbors—that by next Christmas, I think we'll be in a very different circumstance, God willing, than we are today. I think a year from now, when it's 22 below zero here—[laughter]—no, a year from now, I think that there'll be significantly fewer people having to be socially distanced, have to wear masks, et cetera. But we don't know.
So I don't want to overpromise anything here. I told you when I ran and when I got elected: I will always level with you. To use Franklin Roosevelt's example, I'll shoot to—give it ""straight from the shoulder""—straight from the shoulder, what I know and what I don't know.
We don't know for certain, but it is highly unlikely that by the beginning of next year's school—traditional school year in September, we are not significantly better off than we are today, but it matters. It matters whether you continue to wear that mask. It matters whether you continue to socially distance. It matters whether you wash your hands with hot water. It—those things matter. They matter. And that can save a lot of lives while we're getting to this point, we get to herd immunity.
Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation 
Mr. Cooper. You've made passing a COVID relief bill the focus of your first 100 days. Those on the right say the proposal is too big; some on the left say it's not big enough. Are you committed to passing $1.9 trillion bill, or is that final number still up for negotiation?
The President. I'm committed to pass—look, here's—some of you are probably economists or college professors or you teach it in school. This is the first time in my career—and as you can tell, I'm over 30—[laughter]—the first time in my career that there is a consensus among economists left, right, and center that is over—and including the IMF and in Europe—that the overwhelming consensus is: In order to grow the economy a year or two, three, and four down the line, we can't spend too much. Now is the time we should be spending. Now is the time to go big.
You may recall I managed the last experiment we had with stimulus, and it was 800—no, I don't mean it that way, but it was $800 billion. We thought we needed more than that. And we think we did. We got—we were—it ended up working, but it slowed things up by about—and it, depending who you talked to—between 6 months and a year and a half.
We can come back—we can come roaring back. It's estimated that if we—by most economists, including Wall Street firms, as well as, you know, think tanks of—political think tanks—left, right, and center—it is estimated that if we pass this bill alone, we'll create 7 million jobs this year—7 million jobs this year.
And so the thing we haven't talked about—and I'm not going to go on because I want to hear your question, and I apologize—we haven't talked about—I remember you and I talking during the campaign, and you had the former guy saying that, ""Well, you know, we're just going to open things up, and that's all we need to do."" We said, ""No, you've got to deal with the disease before you deal with the—with getting the economy going.""
Well, the fact is that the economy now has to be dealt with. And what is—look at all the people. You have over 10 million people unemployed. We need unemployment insurance. We need to make sure that, you know, you have 40 percent of the children in America are—talk about food shortage—60 percent of—did you ever think you'd see a day, Milwaukee—you'd see in the last 6 months, people lining up in their automobiles for an hour, for as far as you can see, to get a bag of food? What—I mean, this is the United States of America, for God's sake. We can't deal with that?
We promised—look at all the people who are on the verge of being kicked out of their apartments because they cannot afford the rent. What happens when that happens? Everything being—look at all the mom-and-pop landlords that are in real trouble if we don't subsidize this in the meantime. Look at all the people who are on the verge of missing—and how many people have missed their last two mortgage payments and are able to be foreclosed on. That's why I took executive action to say they cannot be foreclosed on in the meantime. Because look at what the impact on the economy would be. You think it's bad now, let all that happen.
Look at all the people who've lost their insurance. How many—I'm not asking for a show of hands. How many of you had jobs with corporations or companies that provided health care? The COBRA health care. Well, guess what? The company goes under, and guess what? You lose your health insurance. Well, we should be making sure you're able to pay for that so that we keep people moving.
So there's a lot—so I think bigger. And the vast majority of the serious people say bigger is better now, not spending less.
Mr. Cooper. This is Randy Lange, an Independent who supported Donald Trump in 2020. Randy is the co-owner of a woodworking company here in Milwaukee.
Randy, welcome.
National Economy/Federal Minimum Wage 
Q. Evening. You're proposing a $15 minimum wage. Given the lower cost of living, specifically in the Midwest, many business owners are concerned that this will put them out of business, forcing them to downsize or cut benefits. How can you instill confidence in small businesses that this will benefit the Midwest business growth?
The President. Well, first of all, the South is not much different than the Midwest in that regard as well. But here's the thing: If you look back over the last 40 years, as minimum wages increased, people haven't—the end result of net employment hasn't changed. The vast majority of economists—and there are studies that show that by increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour, it could have an impact on a number of businesses, but it would be de minimis, et cetera.
Here's the deal: It's about doing it gradually. We're at $7.25 an hour. No one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty. No one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty. But it's totally legitimate for small-business owners to be concerned about how that changes. For example, if it went—if we gradually increased it—when we indexed it at $7.20, if we kept it indexed by—to inflation, people would be making 20 bucks an hour right now. That's what it would be.
Mr. Cooper. The Congressional Budget Office says that a $15 minimum wage would lift 900,000 people out of poverty, but would also cost 1.4 million people their jobs. Is that——
The President. Yes, but there's also—if you read that whole thing about Pinocchios and all the rest—there are also an equal number of studies that say that's not—that wouldn't have that effect and particularly as you do it—in terms of how gradually you do it. So let's say—you said you're going to increase the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour, between now and the year 2025, to $12 an hour, to $13—you double someone's pay—and the impact on business would be absolutely diminished, and it would grow the GDP, and it would grow, and it would generate economic growth.
But it's not illegitimate as a small-business person to worry about whether or not increasing it at one fell swoop would have that impact. I do support a $15 minimum wage. I think there is equally as much, if not more, evidence to dictate that it would grow the economy and, long run and medium run, benefit small businesses as well as large businesses, and it would not have such a dilatory effect. But that's a debatable issue.
Mr. Cooper. I want you to meet another small-business owner. This is Tim Eichinger, a Democrat from Milwaukee, co-owner of Black Husky Brewing.
Tim, welcome.
Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation/Federal Assistance to Small Businesses 
Q. Thank you. My partner and I own a small brewery in the Riverwest neighborhood of Milwaukee, and we have nine amazing employees. We rely primarily on selling our beer out of our tap room. And with the pandemic, our business has gone down about 50 percent. Now, we've relied primarily on loans, grants, as well as our own reserves to survive. However, the new assistance has been too slow, and recently, it's gotten more restrictive on how we can apply it. What will you do so that small mom-and-pop businesses like ours will survive over large corporate entities?
The President. Change it drastically, first of all, by making sure we have inspectors general. You may remember when the first bill passed, you may remember there was a guy running, saying: ""What's going to happen is the banks aren't going to lend you the money. They're going to ask you a question, 'Do you have your credit with us? How many loans do you have with us? What is your—what credit cards do you have with us? How""—because even though they were being underwritten, and we bailed their rear ends out—last time out, they weren't—it was too much trouble to lend to you.
What did the President do? And I don't want to pick on the President—I shouldn't—I don't—I'm tired of talking about Donald Trump. I don't want to talk about him anymore. But the last administration spent time—a lot of time—talking about how there was no need for inspector generals. We find out that 40 percent of the money—the PPE loans to go to—PPP loans that go to small businesses went to—went to corporations that were multimillion-dollar corporations. And you're going to see an investigation showing that a lot of this was fraudulent where it went.
So what I'm doing is, I'm providing $60 billion for you to be able to make capital investments in order to be able to open safely and make sure you're in a position that y",,,,,,,,,,,,,
u can do the things that are recommended. You've noticed, there's been very little Federal direction for you all as to how to safely open your businesses. Yet you know, if you're able to test your employees, if you're able to be in a situation if you serve people, you have Plexiglas dividers; if you—a whole range. If you're able to have everybody with a mask and the like, you can do so much to safely open, but you don't get that direction.,,,,,,,,,
So the money, I guarantee you, is going to go to small businesses with people. And I'm shooting—and by the way, the original definition of a small business is 500 or fewer employees. Well, that's not what I mean by small businesses. What we meant by small business is the mom-and-pop businesses—hold communities together and keep people together, and particularly in neighborhoods where if you don't have a beauty shop, a barber shop, a hardware store, a grocery store, et cetera, the center of the community begins to disintegrate some.,,,,,
So what I'd like to do is, if you are willing to give me an address, lay out for you precisely—without taking more time, I'm going to get in trouble; I'm supposed to only talk 2 minutes in an answer—[laughter]—is to let you know exactly how that $60 billion in part of the recovery package will go to small businesses.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. Right. We're going to take a quick break. When we get back, we'll have more questions for the President of the United States, Joe Biden. We'll be right back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[At this point, there was a commercial break begins.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Former President Donald J. Trump ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. And welcome back. We're live at a CNN town hall event at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with President Joe Biden. We are back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks so much for being here. We—before we get back into—to the audience, I wanted to ask just a question about what we just witnessed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Before the Senate voted to acquit the former President in the impeachment trial," you said you were anxious to see if Republican Senators would stand up. Only seven did. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the rest """"cowards."""" Do you agree with her?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. I'm not going to call names out. I—look, I—for 4 years, all that's been in the news is Trump. The next 4 years, I want to make sure all in the news is the American people. I'm tired of talking about Trump. It's done.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the former President is, quote," """"still liable for everything he did while he was in office."""" If your Department of Justice wanted to investigate him", would you allow them to proceed?,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. I made it clear: One of the things about—one of the most serious pieces of damage done by the last administration was the politicizing of the Justice Department. Any of you who are lawyers know—whether you're a Democrat, Republican, conservative, or liberal—it has been more politicized than any Justice Department in American history. I made a commitment: I will not ever tell my Justice Department—and it's not mine; it's the people's Justice Department—who they should and should not prosecute. Their prosecutorial decisions will be left to the Justice Department, not me.,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. I want you to meet Joel Berkowitz from Shorewood. He is a Democrat, a professor of Foreign Languages and Literature at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joel, thanks for being here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. Thank you, Anderson. Good evening, Mr. President.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. I'm not bad at the literature part, but after 5 years of French, I still can't speak a word. So I apologize. [Laughter],,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. I'll teach you some Yiddish sometime. How's that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. I—hey, by the way, I understand a little bit of Yiddish. [Laughter],,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. I'm sure you do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. It would be a shonda if you didn't. But—[laughter].,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President's Efforts To Combat White Supremacy Groups ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. More seriously, Mr. President, like millions of my fellow citizens, I was shaken by the attack on the Capitol on January 6, and on our democracy more broadly, by your predecessor and his followers. While I appreciate efforts being made to bring them to justice, I worry about ongoing threats to our country from Americans who embrace White supremacy and conspiracies that align with it. What can your administration do to address this complex and wide-ranging problem?,,,,,,,,,
The President. It is complex, it's wide ranging, and it's real. You may—I got involved in politics to begin with because of civil rights and opposition to White supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan. And the most dangerous people in America continue to exist. That is the greatest threat to—terror in America: domestic terror.,,,,,,,,,,,,
And so I would make sure that my Justice Department and the Civil Rights Division is focused heavily on those very folks. And I would make sure that we, in fact, focus on how to deal with the rise of White supremacy. And you see what's happening—and the studies that are beginning to be done, maybe at your university as well—about the impact of former military, former police officers, on the growth of White supremacy in some of these groups.,,,,,,,,,,
You may remember in one of my debates with the former President, I asked him to condemn the Proud Boys. He wouldn't do it. He said," """"Stand by. Stand ready."""" Or whatever the phrasing exactly was. It is a bane on our existence. It has always been. As Lincoln said"," """"We have to appeal to our better angels."""" And these guys are not—and women—are", in fact, demented. They are dangerous people.,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. I want you to meet James Lewis, an Independent from Milwaukee. He's a labor attorney.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
James, welcome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. James, if I say anything you don't like, let me know right away, will you?,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. All right. You're all right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. About as big as a mountain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Law Enforcement Reform/Policing Best Practices/Racial Profiling/Fair Sentencing Guidelines ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. Good evening, President Biden. I was a public defender in Kenosha County when the police shot Jacob Blake. I witnessed the city I worked in burned and devastated. And recently, District Attorney Michael Graveley denied to prosecute the police officers responsible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So my question to you is: What will your administration do to correct these wrongs that we witnessed just—not just in Kenosha, but across this country? And what will we do to bridge the gap between communities and their police?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Three things. First of all, I was a public defender as well, and I think it's high time that we had public defenders being paid the same as prosecutors. My son, by the way, was a great prosecutor; he was the attorney general of the State of Delaware, and he was a Federal prosecutor before that. And so I'm not condemning all prosecutors, but I am saying that it matters that you have adequate defense and you are able to attract people who, in fact, can live on being able to be that public defender, number one.,,,,,,
Number two: We are pushing very hard, and I think we'll get it done—is the legislation relating to what is appropriate police behavior and studying police behavior and coming down with recommendations that are consistent with the legislation that was put in place as a consequence of all the world seeing one man shoved up against the curb and murdered after 8 minutes and 46 seconds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And so there's a number of things relating to everything from no-knock warrants and a whole range of things you know. But there's legislation that's being introduced separately. I hope it will pass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But thirdly, I think we have to deal with systemic racism that exists throughout society. And one of the things I'm going to recommend there is that we look at an entire panoply of things that affect whether or not people of color, primarily, are treated differently. And that goes through everything from prosecutorial discretion—you know, as a public defender what, by that, I mean. What happens is—it will take too long to go through the whole explanation, but let me do it—try to go quickly.,,,,,,,,
What happens now is, if you in fact are, in going to—you arrest someone because they had—and you want to charge them, you can charge them with robbery or armed robbery. You charge them with armed robbery, you get a lot more time than if you don't charge with robbery. But if you want to make sure that someone who doesn't know much about their representation is able to, yes, you engage in prosecutorial misconduct by offering them to plead to, essentially—I mean, it's not the same—burglary, which gets them 2 years in probation and—so you don't even get a trial. You plead because you don't have adequate representation. You feel like everything is against you, and you're in trouble. When I did the sentencing act, that was designed to keep—make sure we had the same time for the same crime.,,,,
As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I looked at all 10 Federal districts—and we took 6 months to do it—and found out if you're Black, and you—or your first-time offense of being accused of burglary—and maybe you committed it, and you were White and you did the same exact crime—in all 10 districts throughout the United States of America, a person—and don't hold me to the exact numbers, but the percentages are right—if you're a first-time White guy, you'd get 2 years; you'd get 7 years if you were Black.,,,,,,,,,
So in order to make sure that you could not send people to jail for the same crime, I came up with this—this Sentencing Commission, which said that you—everybody who commits the crime has to receive between—instead of zero to 20 years, you drastically cut down the number of years you could go to jail. But say you have to—if you—if it's a one—first-time offense, you have to get sentenced between 1½ and 3 years. Okay?,,,,,,,,,,,
Well, what happens is prosecutors use that as a mechanism to send people to jail. It makes it look like they're—we're dealing with mandatory sentencing, which it wasn't designed to do at all. It was designed to make sure that people were treated fairly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's much—I'm sorry to go on. There's much more to talk about, but——,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. Yes. We actually have a related question over here. This is Dannie Evans, a pastor in Janesville, who works as a supervisor for the juvenile justice diversion program in Rock County. He's an Independent, voted for Donald Trump in 2020. He's also a member the State's 32-member Racial Disparity Task Force, created in the wake of the Jacob Blake shooting last summer.,,,,,,,,,,,
Dannie, welcome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Law Enforcement Reform/Community Policing Practices/Police Training and Recruitment Practices/Systemic Racism ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. Good afternoon," Mr. President. """"Defund the Police"""" is discussed as an option for reforming policing; however", there are communities where people live in fear not of the police, but in fear of the violent gangs who commit crimes——,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Exactly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. ——in those neighborhoods. How can we be sure that we don't overlegislate police officers so that they can't do their job to protect the law-abiding citizens who live in these high-crime neighborhoods and yet train officers to police with compassion?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. By, number one, not defunding the police. We have to put more money in police work so we have legitimate community policing and we're in a situation where we change the legislation. No one should go to jail for a drug offense. No one should go to jail for the use of a drug. They should go to drug rehabilitation. Drug rehabilitation. Number one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We should be in a position where we change the system—of sentencing system—to one that relates to a notion of—they start telling you to—as related to making sure that what you do is, you focus on making sure that there's rehabilitation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The idea that we don't have people in prison systems learning how to be—spending the money—learning how to be mechanics, learning how to be cooks, learning how to have a profession when you get out; the idea that we deny someone, who served their time, access to Pell grants, access to housing, access to—right now, as you well know, most places you get out of prison, you get 25 bucks and a bus ticket. You end up back under the bridge exactly where you were before.,,,,,,
And the fact is that—the concern in many minority communities is Black-on-Black, Hispanic-on-Hispanic, not just—but here's the deal: There has to be much more serious—how can I say it?—much more serious determination as to what the background and the attitudes of the recruit is, where—what their views are. There should be much more psychological testing, like you would if you go into the intelligence community. What is it? What are the things that make you respond the way you do? Because there is inherent prejudice built into the system as well.,,,,,,,,,,,
And we also need to provide for—and it's happening—more African American and more Hispanic police officers. Now, by the way, they don't get it all right either, by a long shot. But every cop, when they get up in the morning and put on that shield, has a right to expect to be able to go home to their family that night. Conversely, every kid walking across the street wearing a hoodie is not a member of a gang and is about to knock somebody off.,,,,,,,,,
So it's about education. I'd love to talk to you more about it, because it's the answer, in my view—that and education—actually, access to education.,,,,,,,,,,,,
And one of the things that I talk a lot about—and I'm sorry to go on about this, but it's important: I don't think we can look at opportunity in the—let's stick with African American community for a minute—in terms of the criminal justice system. That is only one small piece of why people are the way they are. You realize—I don't know what home you live in, but if you go ahead and you wanted to get insurance, and you're in a Black neighborhood, you're going to pay more for the same insurance that I'm going to pay for the exact same home. Your car—you never had an accident in your car. If you live in a Black neighborhood, you're going to pay a higher premium on your car.,,,,,,,,,,
You're going to—so there's so many things that are built in institutionally that disadvantage African Americans and Latinos that we—in fact, I think—and one of the great advantages—I'm sorry, but one of the great advantages—as bad as things are—I keep reading from Presidential historians how I've inherited the worst situation since Lincoln, worse than Roosevelt, because—economic crisis, political crisis, racial crisis, et cetera.,,,,,,,,
But the fact is that everyone has gotten a close-up look now and seen what's happened. That kid holding that camera for 8 minutes and 46 seconds awakened the whole world. When I met with his little daughter, after he was dead, she said," """"My daddy has changed the world."""" Guess what? Not only here in the United States. Around the world", people said," """"Whoa"," I didn't know that happened.""""",,,,,,,,,
Dr. King—when my generation—when I got involved in the civil rights movement as a high school student in the early sixties—and you had Bull Connor and his dogs in the late fifties sicking on those ladies going to—in their black dresses going to church—and little kids and fire hoses ripping their skin off. He said," """"What happened there was—it was a second emancipation."""" Because people in places where there weren't Black communities said: """"That really happens? I didn't believe it."""" They saw it happen. And so it generated the—the Voting Rights Act. It generated the Civil Rights Act. And he called it the """"second emancipation."""" We have a chance now—a chance now—to make significant change in racial disparities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I'm going to say something that's going to get me in trouble, which—I couldn't go through the whole show without doing that. [Laughter] And that is that—think about it: If you want to know where the American public is, look at the money being spent in advertising. Did you ever, 5 years ago, think every second or third ad out of five or six you'd turn on would be biracial couples?,,,,,,,,,,,
No, no, I'm not being facetious—the reason I'm so hopeful is, this new generation—they're not like us. They're thinking differently. They're more open. And we've got to take advantage of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. I want you to——,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. I'm sorry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. I want you to meet Luverda Martin, a Democrat from Mequan or Mequon——,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. Mequon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. Mequon, sorry. Luverda is a certified nurse, midwife. Welcome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. Good evening, Mr. President.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Good evening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President's Agenda ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. Our Nation's experiences with and through COVID-19 and other recent tragedies have strengthened the foundation of division among Americans. What are your immediate and tangible plans to address how deeply divided we are as a Nation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. I take issue with what everybody says about the division. For example, my plan on COVID: 69 percent of the American people support it—69. In this State—recent poll—60 percent. Sixty percent. Forty-five percent of Trump voters and fifty-five percent of Republican voters. The Nation is not divided. You go out there and take a look and talk to people. You have fringes on both ends, but it's not nearly as divided as we make it out to be. And we have to bring it together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You may remember how—trouble I get in. I said there were three reasons I was running: One, to restore the soul of the country—decency, honor, integrity; talk about the things that matter to people, treat people with dignity. Secondly, I said, to rebuild the backbone of the country, the middle class, and this time bring everybody along and have a chance. And the third reason was unite the country. On my own primary," I got a lot of: """"Unite the country? What are you talking about?""""",,,,,,
You cannot function in our system without consensus, other than abusing power at the executive level. So I really think there's so many things that we agree on that we don't focus enough on. And that's, in large part, I think, because we don't just condemn the things that are so obviously wrong—obviously wrong—that everybody agrees on. The way they were raised. The way we were raised. As my mother would say, if half the things that occurred in the last campaign came out of my mouth, as she'd say as a kid, we'd wash my mouth out with soap. [Laughter] I mean, we have to be more decent and treat people with respect and just decency.,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. But let me——,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. And——,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Immigration Reform ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. Let me ask about—a question which does often divide many people in this country: immigration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. Your administration, along with congressional Democrats, expected to unveil an immigration reform bill just this week. You want a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants. Would you sign any immigration bill if it did not include that: a pathway for the roughly 11 million undocumented——,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Yes, there's a whole range of things that relate to immigration, including the whole idea how you deal with—you know, what confuses people, is you talk about refugees, you talk about undocumented, you talk about people who are seeking asylum, and you talk about people who are coming from the—that are coming from camps or being held around the world.,,,,,,,,
And there are four different criteria for being able to come to the United States. The vast majority of the people, those 11 million undocumented, they're not Hispanics; they're people who came on a visa—who was able to buy a ticket to get in a plane and didn't go home. They didn't come across the Rio Grande swimming—excuse me. [Laughter] And—sorry, that's the Irish in me. [Laughter] But all kidding aside. So there are a lot of things that relate—but I think that we can no longer—look, you've heard—I'm—even if you're not involved in politics at all, you've probably heard me say this a thousand times, and matter of—that everyone is entitled to be treated with decency, with dignity. Everyone is entitled to that.,,,,,,,,
And we don't do that enough. For the first time in American history, if you're seeking asylum—meaning you're being persecuted, you're seeking asylum—you can't do it from the United States. You used to come, have an asylum officer determine whether or not you met the criteria, and send you back if you in fact—but you can't even do that. You've got to seek asylum from abroad.,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. But just to be clear, though—and I know you're going to be announcing stuff later this week, or that's what I've heard—you do want a pathway to citizenship——,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. ——for roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. And that would be essential in any bill for you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Well, yes. The—but, by the way, if you came along and said to me," """"In the meantime"," we can work out a system whereby we're going to""""—for example", we used to allow refugees—125,000 refugees in the United States in a yearly basis. It was as high as 250,000. Trump cut it to 5,0,,,,,,
Come with me into Sierra Leone. Come with me into parts of Lebanon. Come with me around the world and see people piled up in camps, kids dying, no way out, refugees fleeing from persecution. We, the United States, used to do our part. We were part of that. We were—and you know, that's—you know," """"send me your huddled masses."""" Come on.",,,,,,,,
And so I would, if you had a refugee bill by itself—I'm not suggesting that—but I would—there's things that I would deal by itself, but not at the expense of saying," """"I'm never going to do the other."""" There is a reasonable path to citizenship.",,,,,,,,,,,,
And it shows up—one of the reasons why we have been able to compete with the rest of the world so well is, most of our major competitors are xenophobic. You remember quite—I remember you questioned me when I came back from China. And I said," """"I predict", within less than a year," they're going to end their 'one China policy.'"""" And I got clobbered by—saying—because they said Biden didn't talk about the fact that—how immoral it was. And it was when we were running against a Republican ticket", led by Mitt Romney, a fine guy.,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. You just talked to China's President, I believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Yes, for 2 hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
U.S.-China Relations/Human Rights Issues in China ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. What about the Uyghurs? What about the human rights abuses in China?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. We must speak up for human rights. It's who we are. We can't—my comment to him was—and I know him well, and he knows me well. We're—a 2-hour conversation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. You talked about this to him?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. I talked about this too. And that's not so much refugee, but I talked about—I said—look, you know, Chinese leaders—if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been—the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven't been unified at home. So the central—to vastly overstate it—the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.,,,,,,,,,,
I point out to him: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesn't reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea I'm not going to speak out against what he's doing in Hong Kong, what he's doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan," trying to end the """"one China"""" policy by making it forceful—I said—and by the—he said he—he gets it. Culturally", there are different norms that each country and they—their leaders—are expected to follow.,,,,,,,,,,,,
But my point was that when I came back from meeting with him and traveling 17,000 miles with him when I was Vice President and he was the vice president—that's how I got to know him so well, at the request of President Hu—not a joke—his predecessor, President Hu—and President Obama wanted us to get to know one another because he was going to be the President.,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I came back and said they're going to end their one-child policy, because they're so xenophobic, they won't let anybody else in, and more people are retired than working. How can they sustain economic growth when more people are retired?,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just—is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.? Or is there any actual repercussions for China?,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Well, there will be repercussions for China, and he knows that. What I'm doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other agencies that have an impact on their attitude.,,,,,,,,,,,
China is trying very hard to become the world leader and to get that moniker. And to be able to do that, they have to gain the confidence of other countries. And as long as they're engaged in activity that is contrary to basic human rights, it's going to be hard for them to do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it's much more complicated than that. I'm—I shouldn't have tried to talk China policy in 10 minutes on television here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. Well, let me bring it back to the United States. I want you to meet Joycelyn Fish, a Democrat from Racine. Joycelyn is the director of marketing for a community theater.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joycelyn, welcome. Your question?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. Hello. Good evening, Mr. President.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Good evening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. Student loans are crushing my family, friends, and fellow Americans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Me too. [Laughter],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Student Loan Forgiveness Programs/Postsecondary Education ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. The American Dream——,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. You think I'm kidding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q. ——is to succeed. But how can we fulfill that dream when debt is many people's only option for a degree? We need student loan forgiveness beyond the potential $10,000 your administration has proposed. We need at least a $50,000 minimum. What will you do to make that happen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. I will not make that happen. It depends on whether or not you go to a private university or public university. It depends on the idea that I say to a community," """"I'm going to forgive the debt""""—the billions of dollars in debt for people who have gone to Harvard and Yale and Penn and schools my children—I went to a great school. I went to a State school. But is that going to be forgiven", rather than use that money to provide for early education for young children who are—come from disadvantaged circumstances?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But here's what I think: I think everyone—and I've been proposing this for 4 years—everyone should be able to go to community college for free. For free. That's—that costs $9 billion, and we should pay for it. And the tax policies we have now—we should be able to pay for you. We spend almost that money as a break for people who own race horses. And I think any family making under $125,000 whose kids go to a State university they get into, that should be free as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the thing I do in terms of student debt that's accumulated is provide for changing the existing system now for debt forgiveness if you engage in volunteer activity. For example, if you were—if you're teaching school, after 5 years, you'd lose—you would have $50,000 of your debt forgiven. If you worked in a battered women's shelter, if you worked—and so on. So you'll be able to forgive debt.,,,,,,,,,,
Thirdly, I'm going to change the position that we have now to allow for debt forgiveness—because it's so hard to calculate—whereby you can now, depending on how much you make and what program you sought, you can work off that debt by the activity you have, and you cannot be charged more than x percent of your take-home pay so that it doesn't affect your ability to buy a car, own a home, et cetera.,,,,,,,,,
Each of my children graduated from school. I mortgaged the house. I was listed as the poorest man in Congress for—not a joke—for over 30 years. And—but I was able to borrow—I bought a home I spent a lot of time working on, and I was able to sell it for some profit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But my oldest son graduated, after undergraduate and graduate school, with $136,000 in debt after working 40—I mean, excuse me, 30 hours a week during school. My other son, who went to Georgetown and Yale Law School, graduated $142,000 in debt, and he worked for a parking service in—down in Washington. My daughter went to Tulane University and then got a masters at Penn. She graduated $103,000 in debt.,,,,,
So I don't think anybody should have to pay for that, but I do think you should be able to work it off. My daughter is a social worker. My other son became a—ran the World Food Program U.S.A., and so on. They didn't qualify.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But my point is: I understand the impact of the debt, and it can be debilitating. And I think there is a whole question about what universities are doing. They don't need more skyboxes. What they need is more money invested in making—so that's why I provide, for example, $80 billion—$70 billion over 10 years for HBCUs and other minority-serving universities, because they don't have the laboratories to be able to bring in those Government contracts that can train people in cybersecurity or other future endeavors that pay well.,,,,,,,,,,,
But I do think that, in this moment of economic pain and strain, that we should be eliminating interest on the debts that are accumulated, number one. And number two, I'm prepared to write off a $10,000 debt, but not 50.,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. Mr. President, let me ask you——,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Because I don't think I have the authority to do it by the sign of the pen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President's Adjustment to Daily Life in the White House ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. You have, over the years—over your career, you've obviously spent a great deal of time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, except now you're living there and you're President. It's been 4 weeks. What's it like? How's it different?,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. I get up in the morning, look at Jill, and say," """"Where the hell are we?"""" [Laughter] No", it's—look, it's—you know, I've only been President 4 weeks. And sometimes—because things are moving so fast, not because of burden—it feels like 4 years. It's not because of the burden; it's because there's so much happening that you focus on. You're constantly focusing on one problem or opportunity, one right—ad seriatum.,,,,,,,
But what happens is that it's—what I didn't realize: I had been in the Oval Office a hundred times as Vice President—or more than that, every morning, for the initial meetings—but I had never been up in the Residence. And one of the things that—I don't know about you all, but I was raised in the way that you didn't look for anybody to wait on you. And it's—we're—I find myself extremely self-conscious. There are wonderful people who work at the White House. But someone, you know, standing there and, you know, making sure I—hands me my suitcoat or——,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. You'd never been in the Residence of the White House?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. I'd only been upstairs in the Yellow Room. You know, the Oval upstairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. I don't know, I've never been there either, but I—[laughter].,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. No. And—but it's—but look, the people down there are wonderful. And I find that, you know—like, my dad—you've heard me say this before—my dad used to say," """"Everybody—everybody—is entitled to be treated with respect."""" And it's interesting how decent and incredible these folks are.",,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. Is it different than you expected it to be, in some ways?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. You know, I don't know what I ever expected it to be. I—it is different in that—I'll get in trouble in here. I said when I was running, I wanted to be President not to live in the White House, but to be able to make the decisions about the future of the country. And so living in the White House, as you've heard other Presidents who have been extremely flattered to live there, has—it's a little like a gilded cage in terms of being able to but—walk outside and do things.,,,,,,,,,,
The Vice President's residence was totally different. You're on 80 acres, overlooking the rest of the city. And you can walk out, and there's a swimming pool. You can walk off a porch in the summer and jump in a pool, and you know, go into work. You can ride a bicycle around and never leave the property and work out. And you can—but the White House is very different.,,,,,,,,,,,
And I feel a sense of—I must tell you, a sense of history about it. Jon Meacham, who you know, and several other Presidential historians, helped me with my—I asked my brother, who's good at this, to set up the Oval Office for me, because it all happens within 2 hours, you know? Literally. They move everything out and move something.,,,,,,,
And it was interesting to hear these historians talk about what—what other Presidents have gone through in the moments and who were the people who stepped up to the ball and who are the people who didn't. And what you realize is the most consequential thing for me is—although I've known this watching seven Presidents who I got to know fairly well—is I always, in the past, looked at the Presidency in the terms of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt and George Washington and how can—they're superhuman.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I had to remind myself, they're really fine men that I knew well—the last seven Presidents—and at least there are people who I knew well enough to know that I can play on the same team with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr. Cooper. Have you picked up the phone and called any former President yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. Yes, I have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. Do you want to say who?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. No, I don't. [Laughter] They're private conversations. [Laughter] But—and by the way, all of them have, with one exception, picked up the phone and called me as well. [Laughter],,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Cooper. I know you don't want to talk about him, but—[laughter].,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The President. No, but, look, it's a—it's the greatest honor I think an American can be given, from my perspective. And I literally pray that I have the capacity to do for the country what you all deserve need be done.,,,,,,,,,,,
But one thing I learned after 8 years with Barack is, no matter how consequential the decision—I got to be the last person in the room with him, literally, on every decision—I can make a recommendation, but I walked out of the room, and it was all him, man. Nobody else. The buck stops there.,,,,,,,,,
And that's where you pray for making sure that you're looking at the impact on the country and a little bit of good luck at the judgment you're making.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12-Feb-21,Remarks Prior to Meeting With Governors and Mayors To Discuss Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation,"Hello, everybody. Thanks for coming in. I'm fortunate to have today a group of leading Governors and mayors of both political parties to talk about the COVID plan we've put forward, and their needs and their ideas and their recommendations on how to proceed.
And the American Rescue Plan is—has multiple pieces. The most important piece, in my view, is making sure we give them enough capacity to deal with the virus in their States and how we're going to do that.
But equally consequential is the need to help the States economically, in terms of everything from unemployment to being able to make sure that they're able to get kids back in schools and what role the Federal Government should play in helping the—getting that done.
And you know, we've—these folks are all on the frontlines. They've been dealing with this crisis from day one. It's—I'm not making a political statement; it just, it's taken a while to adjust. They've been left on their own, in many cases. I think some have found what I found when I got here: that what we thought was available, in terms of everything from vaccine to vaccinators, was not the case.
So I thank them for the work they did in their cities and their States in order to respond to the crisis. But I think it's—and I've said it plainly when I was running and as President—that I think the Federal Government has a major role to play here. But these are the folks that are on the ground dealing with it every single solitary day. And they see the pain, and they see the successes when they occur.
And what I really want to know about is what should that—the recovery plan—should we have more or less of anything in it; what do they think they need most; how to proceed. Because, as I've said before, you know, Governors and mayors, that's a real job.
I was a Senator for years. I got on a train every day and came to Washington, DC, and I'd get asked questions by the conductors and the shoeshine guys and the ticket masters and—but every single day, these folks are home. Every single day, they're meeting with their constituents.
We're down here in Washington, and we meet with them. I don't mean to belittle them at all, but it's not the same as being on the ground. And so whenever I want to know what's really happening, I want to talk—and I'm not being solicitous—to Governors and mayors.
And so thank you for being here. And that's what we're going to be doing today. Thank you all.","NOTE: The President spoke at 11:44 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White House.

11-Feb-21,"Remarks to National Institutes of Health Staff in Bethesda, Maryland","Good afternoon, folks.
I had a little discussion with my friends behind me, Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci, about whether or not I should take my mask off. And the truth is, although we're more than 10 feet away, I think it's important that I not. It's critically important the message—and I realize I'm speaking to a vast majority—at least, I hope I am—of the folks out here at NIH. You know that wearing this mask through the next year here can save lives, a significant numbers of lives. And so I apologize if you don't hear me as clearly as you—maybe you should.
I'd like to start off by thanking Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci for hosting me today. I spent a lot of time working with Dr. Collins on the Cancer Institute matters. And I said he's the first person I called to ask if he'd stay. But then, I was reminded: I called Dr. Fauci before I got elected and said, ""Would you stay if I came?"" [Laughter] So thank you both for staying.
Our Nation is fortunate to have both of you in this—in these critical roles. And that goes for the world-class doctors, scientists, researchers here at the NIH. And I just toured the Vaccine Research Center with Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci and Dr. Graham and Dr. Corbett. It's incredible. It's a place to go where you—our top minds spend years researching vaccines and treatments for all kinds of viruses, and partnering with academia and industry to prepare for the next one, because there will be others: HIV, influenza, SARS, MERS, West Nile, Zika, Ebola, and today, COVID-19.
To all—to all of you, your work made possible the remarkably rapid development of COVID—19 vaccines we have today. It's incredible. Initially, people were talking years, if not decades, before we'd have a vaccine.
On behalf of a grateful nation—and I don't say that lightly—on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to thank you and your families for your work and your sacrifice, for there is no doubt your families sacrificed a great deal for the endless hours you put in to save the rest of us. And I know it wasn't easy.
The devastation of this pandemic—the loss of life and livelihoods—hasn't spared the scientific community: labs closed, research delayed, careers disrupted, especially for those in training. Yet, with every moment of despair in this past year, you and all the heroes and heroines on the frontlines of the—and the frontiers of this pandemic remind us who we are.
We are America. We never give up. We never give in. We give back, and we follow the science and find the answers. That's what all of you do here. That's what we've seen all across the country.
The scientific community repurposed labs to work on COVID-19, develop therapeutics, new diagnostics technologies, and vaccines in record time. And you're highlighting lessons learned on the importance of pandemic preparedness, public-private partnerships, real-time data-sharing, and most of all, speed and efficiency without compromising science and good conscience.
Look, you're an incredible group of people. I've been out here many times trying to help—trying to help my son who passed away with cancer. You're an incredible, incredible group of people. And that's not hyperbole. We still—what we know is, we still have a long way to go. It's no secret that the vaccination program was in much worse shape than my team and I anticipated. We were under the impression, I'm told, that we had a lot more resources than we did when we came into office. We've only been here 3 weeks, but we've learned a great deal in those 3 weeks.
While scientists did their job in discovering vaccines in record time, my predecessor—I'll be very blunt about it—did not do his job in getting ready for the massive challenge of vaccinating hundreds of millions of Americans. He didn't order enough vaccines. He didn't mobilize enough people to administer the shots. He didn't set up the Federal vaccine centers where eligible people could go and get their shots.
When I became President 3 weeks ago, America had no plan to vaccinate most of the country. It was a big mess. It's going to take time to fix, to be blunt with you. I promised, when I did my Inaugural Address, that I'd always be straight with you, give it to you straight from the shoulder: I will not walk away when we make a mistake; I'll acknowledge it and tell you the truth. We started on day one. We won't have everything fixed for a while, but we're going to fix it.
First, the vaccine. I know people want confidence that it's safe. Well, listen to Dr. Fauci. I did. I got my shots. My wife Jill did. Kamala did, and her husband Doug did. So Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins got it also. It's safe. And we need more people to get vaccinated to beat this pandemic.
That's why, in the first 3 weeks that I've been in office, we've increased the supply of weekly vaccine shipments to the States by almost 30 percent. That means millions more Americans will get vaccinated in February than the previous administration was on track to do.
But that's just the start. We bought more vaccines. Two weeks ago, I directed Jeff Zients, who's here with me—my COVID-19 Response Coordinator—to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to purchase more vaccines. Just this afternoon we signed the final contracts for 100 million more Moderna and 100 million more Pfizer vaccines. And we're also able to move up the delivery dates with an additional 200 million vaccines to the end of July, faster than we expected.
And in further good news, both companies agreed—and we're now contractually obligated—to expedite delivery of 100 million doses, that were promised by the end of June, to deliver them by the end of May. That's a month faster. That means lives will be saved.
That means we're now on track to have enough supply for 300 million Americans by the end of July. It may not sound like the urgent progress we need, but let's be clear: When I took office, just 3 weeks ago, this country did not have a plan or enough vaccines or people to vaccinate Americans—any—all Americans, at any time, in any point in 2021.
Within 3 weeks, round-the-clock work with so many people—people standing behind me and in front of me—we've now purchased enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all Americans. And now we're working to get those vaccines into the arms of millions of people.
In just 3 weeks, you deployed over 1,000 Federal staff to vaccination sites around the country. We're helping give shots and set up and speed up vaccination operations. To date, we've also provided $3 billion to 37 States and Territories and Tribes to bolster existing vaccination centers and create more of the centers to administer—where we administer the vaccine.
For example, 3 days ago, Vice President Harris and I, we had a virtual tour of a federally supported vaccine center in a parking lot of the Arizona Cardinal stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It's open 24/7.
Folks who are eligible can call by phone or sign up online for an appointment. They literally drive in, stay in their cars, get a shot, get a card, and schedule the next shot. On average, it's about 30 minutes from start to finish. In just 3 weeks, the site has administered 160,000 doses, now averaging 8,000 vaccinations through the day and night. Look, it's coordination between State and Federal Government, and the private sector partnership is essential.
One of the nurses coordinating the effort in Arizona said the work was like administering—and I love this phrase, Doc—she said, ""like administering a dose of hope."" Like administering a dose of hope. Let me say that: a dose of hope. We're going to get those doses of hope out at new and large-scale vaccination centers that were set up by the Federal Government.
During the Super Bowl, we got a call from the NFL. The commissioner of football, Goodell, said we could have access to all 30 of the NFL stadiums for mass vaccination sites. We just announced we've worked with the Governors to set up these new federally run sites in California, New York, Texas, with many more to come.
We're going to target communities that have been the hardest hit, and it will be staffed by our military; the Federal Emergency Management Association [Agency]*—FEMA—same people who respond to hurricanes and storms, and the like; and other Federal experts at the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Department of Agriculture to get vaccinators to make sure it gets in people's arms.
When I got to office, there was no Federal plan—none—to ship vaccines directly to local pharmacies. So folks who are allowed to get vaccination under the State rules, as the allocation of who gets in line, are allowed to get one, can schedule an appointment now and get COVID-19 vaccine shots like they would a flu shot from their pharmacy. And we'll start today—that program.
And for folks who can't get to a pharmacy, we're deploying mobile units and sending vaccination—vaccines to community health centers—federally run community health centers—to take care of the poorest of the poor, that reach the hardest hit in those underserved areas in the country—Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities. This is an important piece to ensure racial equity remains at the center of our COVID—19 response, which is something, I know, Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci are focused on as well.
Another point of progress is, we're deploying more vaccinators. We're now allowing retired doctors and nurses to come back and administer shots. We're deploying Federal vaccinators, and over the last 3 weeks, we put hundreds of new vaccinators in the field and are lining up thousands more. These include medical personnel from our Commissioned Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as personnel from FEMA, the Defense Department, and more departments to come.
All told, we're on track to surpass the goal I set on day one. When I was sworn in, I indicated—just before I was sworn in, I indicated that my hope was to administer 100 million shots in the first 100 days of our term. I believe we'll not only reach that, but we'll break that.
But like I said before, that's just the floor. That's just the floor. Our end goal is beating COVID-19. Which brings us to the challenge that remains.
We remain in the teeth of this pandemic. January of 2021 was the deadliest month we've had. We lost over 100,000—100,000—of our fellow citizens. We're on track to cross 500,000 dead Americans this next month. The new strains emerging create immense challenges, and masking is still the easiest thing to do to save lives. But we need everyone to mask up.
And by the way, I know it's a pain in the neck, but it's a patriotic responsibility. We're in the middle of a war with this virus. It's a patriotic responsibility, not only if you care about your family, if you care about your fellow Americans. You realize more people have died in the last 12 months than died in all 4 years in World War II? All 4 years.
That's why I asked what the full extent of my authority as President of the United States could be. I signed an Executive order that required masking on all Federal property, on modes of travel like planes, trains, and buses across interstate commerce. And I've been calling on Governors—Republican and Democrat—and mayors—Republican and Democrat—and local officials to institute mask mandates within their jurisdictions. We need everyone to do their part for themselves, for their loved ones, and yes, for their country.
Mask up, America. Mask up.
And to really get ahead of this pandemic instead of chasing it, we need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan. And I'm grateful that the Senate and the House are moving quickly. And my hope is that we'll get Republicans, as well as Democrats, to support us.
But we can't wait. People are dying every minute from this pandemic. And we're suffering a profound economic crisis that the pandemic has created. Every major economist in the country—left, right, and center—says we can't go big enough here. And if we want to get our economy back in shape, we've got to move quickly.
How many of you out there don't have enough food to eat? How many of you out there are worried whether you can pay next month's rent or pay your mortgage? How many of you out there have a child at home because a school is not open and you have to make the difficult choice of staying home with your child or going to work if you have a job? This is not who we are. In the United States of America, we take care of our own.
And job number one of the American Rescue Plan is fighting the pandemic. It puts $160 billion into our national COVID strategy, which includes more money for testing and tracing, manufacturing and distribution, and setting up vaccination sites—everything that's needed to get vaccines into people's arms. The American Rescue Plan also includes $4 billion to build new manufacturing plants. So we are ready to manufacture vaccines we don't—and we don't have to wait.
You know, there's simply nothing more important than getting the resources we need to vaccinate people in this country as quickly as possible—as quickly as possible. We're not going to get our economy back in shape and millions of people back to work until we beat this virus.
As I said, everyone from Moody's on Wall Street to a whole range of other think tanks indicates that if we do this plan, we'll get to full employment within 2 years. We'll be in a situation where we actually grow the economy, creating millions of jobs immediately and put us in a position where we are going to have the GDP grow at a higher rate than under—if we don't do this.
We're in a national emergency. I want to close with this: We're in a national emergency. And this will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we have ever undertaken as a nation. It's going to take time. We're going to face setbacks along the way. And I promise you, when we do, I'll just own up to it and say what they are. But we have to stay vigilant. We have to stay focused.
And for God's sakes, we have to remember who we are: We are the United States of America. We can do this. We have the resources. We just have to choose to use them.
We have to do what all of you do here at NIH and across the scientific community: Keep the faith with purpose and vision and with every dose of hope we have. Folks, remember, like I said: This is America. We have never, never, never failed. We've decided to stand together and act together. That's who we are. That's not chauvinism; that's just a fact. We've never failed when we stood together. If there's ever a time we need to stand together, it's now.
May God bless you all, and may God bless everyone here at NIH—all the doctors, scientists, and researchers fighting this pandemic and saving lives. And may God protect our troops. Thank you very, very much. You're the best America has to offer here at NIH. Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart.","NOTE: The President spoke at 4:43 p.m. at the Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory of the National Institute of Health.

11-Feb-21,"Remarks During a Laboratory Tour at the National Institutes of Health's Vaccine Research Center and an Exchange With Reporters in Bethesda, Maryland","[The President's remarks were joined in progress.]
The President. Well, we're in a position now where we're just—in talking with Jeff—we've been pushing really, really hard with the manufacturing to significantly increase in the timeframe.
Jeff, when will it be by? By June, we'll have—how much will we have?
White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeffrey D. Zients. We'll have 400 million does by June, which is enough to vaccinate 200 million Americans. And then, you ordered another 200 million doses——
The President. Yes.
Coordinator Zients. ——to be delivered this summer.
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci. That's the best way to stop the mutations.
The President. No, I realize that. And one of the things that—you know, it's amazing how quickly things change in terms of people's perceptions, mine included. I know just a little tiny bit about this because I worked with that guy on cancer issues for a long, long while—[inaudible]—started with the Cancer Institute. Anyway.
But what I didn't realize was just how much of the vaccine we're going to have to actually get produced. And it's one thing to have the vaccine; it's another thing to have vaccinators to put it into people's arms. And it's really turned out to be a gigantic logistical issue for us.
And I can say—I don't mean it as a criticism, just an observation—when we—we've been in office now 3 years—no, 3 weeks. [Laughter]
National Institutes of Health Director Francis S. Collins. It just feels like 3 years. [Laughter]
The President. Just feels like 3 years. But what happened is that we were led to—if you ever hear anybody talking about transitions between Presidents, it's really important, because we didn't have any access to the transition. And you know, Doc; we talked about it. And so we thought, and we were led to believe, there was a lot more vaccine available than there was.
And when I said ""in the first 100 days,"" I guaranteed—I promised that we would get 100 million shots in people's arms, everybody said, ""No, that's—you can't do that."" It's amazing—now I'm getting, ""Why can't you get more?"" Now we're getting a lot more, as we said, on average, but it could be significantly more.
But to get to the place where—and these guys legitimately always ask me—is: ""When will we have enough vaccine to have that 300-plus million people?"" And even though we've increased by close to 600 million—promises of the vaccine—we're going to be in a position where it's going to be—it is not going to be by the end of the summer. [Laughter] And so all the Americans who are looking for it—and that's why I keep listening to you talking about when we could theoretically reach enough of a saturation of access that we slow down the spread.
And so—but this is the—it's an amazing—and by the way, every department is jumping in. The Defense Department over there, they jumped right in like they did with dealing with Ebola before, in Africa. They're probably going to have, literally, over a hundred thousand—I mean, excuse me, 10,000 vaccinators. They're picking people up all over; people are coming out of retirement and stepping up.
Coronavirus Containment Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, how worried are you about the variants? How worried are you about the variants?
The President. Well, we talked about the variants, and I'll—rather than Joe Biden, the lawyer, explain the variants—I think I understand it—but I think it's important that, Doc, you talk about the variants and what we're anticipating and what we think the situation is going to be.
Director Fauci. The 117—that's the U.K. variant that we feel the modelers are going to tell us is going to be dominant by the end of March—the vaccines that we have now look pretty good against being able to prevent infection and certain disease.
The South African variant is a little bit more problematic. It diminishes the capability of the vaccines to induce the virus's—the antibodies that would suppress it. But it doesn't completely eliminate it, and we know that from studies with other vaccines in South Africa, where it went down to maybe 50 percent efficacy. But it was very good in preventing severe disease. In fact, there were no hospitalizations or deaths.
Bottom line is: We take it seriously. We're following it. And if necessary, we're able to make boosts that reflect the variants in question.
Presidential Transition/Coronavirus Vaccine Supply and Deployment 
Q. Are you upset with the state of the rollout before you got here, Mr. President?
The President. No, I'm not. I think—look, these folks have been absolutely amazing. What I was upset with is not having all the facts that were available to the last outfit, that we did not know.
So we were under the distinct impression there was significantly more vaccine available to begin to be distributed; that it was a distribution problem—which it is and was, but that wasn't the main problem; it was having enough. And then, getting—you know, there's a big difference—the logistical difference between having a vaccine sent to the States in bulk and refrigerated, and having vaccinators with the paraphernalia to put it into a vial and stick it in someone's arm—is a very different and logistical problem—difficult problem.
So there's the vaccine. There is the access to the vaccine, in terms of how you get it where it has to be. That is a giant logistical issue, and we're solving that now.
For example, we are, as of—was it today, Jeff? We're doing—we're making sure that all these Federal systems, community——
Coordinator Zients. Community health centers.
The President. ——community health centers that are federally run—we are getting them—what day are we getting——
Coordinator Zients. Starting next week.
The President. Starting next week, they'll get——
Coordinator Zients. And pharmacies start today.
The President. And the pharmacies start today. We thought, by listening—at least my team did—between the time we were elected and the time somebody recognized we were elected, that we thought that it was well underway; that the drugstores were beginning—you know, all the places—the Walmarts of the world—were ready. But it turned out they weren't. And so we—it's been a hell of a learning process. [Laughter]
But you have done an enormous, enormous—all—every other scientist I've talked to across the board said the idea that it would end in less than a year—you'd come up with a vaccine——

11-Feb-21,Remarks Prior to Meeting With Senators on Infrastructure and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Folks, thanks for coming in. I'm going to be very brief. We're going to get to it.
We want to talk about infrastructure, and this committee is central to everything that's going to happen. I've been around long enough—and Tom and Jim and all of us—that—it used to be that infrastructure wasn't a Democrat or Republican issue. There are not many Republican or Democratic roads and bridges and so on.
So we're going to talk about infrastructure. And hear—I want to hear what's on the minds of my colleagues here, and we're going to see what we can put together. There's a number of things that are out there that the American people are looking at us to step up.
Again, it's not—I really, honest to God, never have thought of the—of infrastructure as being a partisan issue. And it's about—I mean, a lot of bridges in West Virginia——
Senator Shelley Moore Capito. That's right.
The President. ——a lot of dangerous spots along Route 9, in terms of Cancer Alley. A lot of places where we're having problems all across the country.
Senator Thomas R. Carper. The highest point of land in Delaware is a bridge, just for the record. [Laughter]
The President. Well, that's true. That's true. And it's named after Bill Roth.
Sen. Carper. My first bill.
The President. That's right. And I'll tell you what—and Tom climbs up all the time. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, there's a lot we have to do. And I could think of no better group of people to start off with to try to see if we can come to some kind of generic consensus about how to begin. They have a lot of jurisdiction over a significant portion of infrastructure.
Last night I was on the phone for 2 straight hours with Xi Jinping. And you all know as well as I do, these folks—and it was a good conversation. I know him well. We spent a lot of time together over the years I was Vice President. And—but you know, they're going to—if we don't get moving, they're going to eat our lunch. They have major, major new initiatives on rail. And they already have rail that goes 225 miles an hour with ease. They're working very hard to do what I think we're going to have to do.
And I think the automobile industry is already there, and so is labor. They're going to—they're working very hard to try to move in a position where they end up being the source of a—of a new way in which to power automobiles, which would—they're going to invest a lot of money. They're investing billions of dollars and dealing with a whole range of issues that relate to transportation, the environment, and a whole range of other things. So we just have to step up.
And so what I'd like to—I'm going to talk to these folks about, which is—they're the key committee—is how we begin this. I've laid out what I think I have to do—we should be doing. And they have a plan, as well, within their jurisdiction. But they're also very, very competent Senators who know a lot more than beyond their jurisdiction about the things they need. So I'm looking for a wholesome conversation or a fulsome conversation.
So thank you all for coming in.

Senate Impeachment Trial of Former President Donald J. Trump 
Q. Did you see the video yesterday during the impeachment trial? And what was your reaction, Mr. President?
The President. I told you, what I'm focused on—my job is to deal with the promises I made. And we all know we have to move on. Today it's about jobs and infrastructure.
I, like other Americans, watched the news. I didn't watch any of the hearing live because I was going straight through, last night, till a little after nine. But I watched some this morning. I think the Senate has a very important job to complete. And I think—my guess is some minds may have been changed, but who—I don't know.
Thank you. Thank you very much.","NOTE: The President spoke at 10:23 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Sen. James M.

10-Feb-21,"Remarks to Department of Defense Personnel at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia","Well, Mr. Secretary, thank you. And good afternoon to everyone. I want to thank Secretary Austin for welcoming the Vice President and me to the Pentagon today. It's good to be back.
Before I begin, I have some welcome news that the Saudi Government has released a prominent human rights activist, Loujain al-Hathloul—loul, excuse me, L-O-U-L—from prison. She's a powerful advocate women's rights, and releasing her was the right thing to do.
It's been a busy day. Earlier, I announced steps we've taken to impose costs on those responsible for the military coup in Burma. And I've just concluded a briefing with the civilian and military leadership where I laid out my national security priorities. And I want to share the message directly with the Department of Defense staff all around the world. Because each of you—each of you—whether you're newly enlisted, a career officer, a noncommissioned officer, or a civilian policy expert, you're essential to how we project our strength around the world, defend America's interests, and advance American leadership in the world.
So often, our Armed Forces and the Department of Defense staff are how the rest of the world encounters America. And you all know as well as anyone that our country is safer and stronger when we lead not just with the example of our power, but with the power of our example.
As your Commander in Chief, I will never hesitate to use force to defend the vital interests of the American people and our allies around the world when necessary. The central, indispensable mission of the Department of Defense is to deter aggression from our enemies and, if required, to fight and win wars to keep America safe.
But I believe force should be a tool of last resort, not first. I understand the full weight of what it means to ask young, proud Americans to stand in the breach. As was referenced by the Secretary, my son Beau served in Iraq for a year. I'm the first President in 40 years, I'm told, who had a son or daughter who served in a war zone. So I know what it's like. Being Commander in Chief is an enormous responsibility and one that I will never take lightly or easily.
I will work with Secretary Austin and leaders around the world to bring a responsible end to wars that have dragged on for far too long, while continuing to ensure that terrorist threats cannot endanger the security of the American people.
I also know that you are essential to the work of our diplomacy, not only as the ultimate guarantor of our security, but as diplomats yourselves. I got to know Secretary Austin when he was serving as commander of U.S. Forces in Iraq. It wasn't just his excellent military leadership, the many times I met him there, and his strategy; he was a consummate diplomat as well. He worked closely with our Ambassador to build relationships with both civilian and military leaders of our coalition partners. Because we are better able to project our power when we're amplifying our strength through our alliances, it was so important.
There is no aspect of our agenda of the 21st-century leadership where the women and men of the Defense Department do not have a role: whether it's helping curb the pandemic here at home and around the world; or addressing the real threats of climate change that already is costing us billions in impacts on our bases, on our national security; or being part of an ongoing fight for racial justice. You are essential to how we must rethink and reprioritize our security to meet the challenges of this century, not the last. We need to take on the dangers and opportunities of emerging technologies, enhance our capabilities in cyberspace, ensure that we are positioned to lead in a new era of competition, from deep sea to outer space. And we need to meet the growing challenges posed by China to keep the peace and defend our interests in the Indo-Pacific and globally.
Today I was briefed on a new DOD-wide China Task Force that Secretary Austin is standing up to look at our strategy and operational concepts, technology, and force posture, and so much more.
The Task Force will work quickly, drawing on civilian and military experts across the Department, to provide, within the next few months, recommendations to Senator [Secretary]* Austin on key priorities and decision points so that we can chart a strong path forward on China-related matters. It will require a whole-of-Government effort, bipartisan cooperation in Congress, and strong alliances and partnerships.
That's how we'll meet the China challenge and ensure the American people win the competition of the future.
You know, to the incredible individuals who serve in our Armed Forces: You are unquestionably part of the finest fighting force in the history of the world. You're warriors. The work you do each and every day is vital to ensuring the American people—your families, friends, and loved ones—are able to live in peace and security and growing prosperity.
And for those of you who raise your hands and sign up to wear the uniform of the United States: We owe you an incredible debt. I've said for many years, less than 1 percent of Americans do what you do: put yourself on the line for the rest of the 99 percent of the Americans you represent. The 99 percent of us owe you. We owe it to you to keep the faith with our sacred obligation to properly prepare and equip you when we send you into harm's way and to care for you and your families, both while you are deployed and after you return home.
You're incredible heroes and incredible patriots. I will never, ever dishonest you—dishonor you. I will never disrespect you. I will never politicize the work you do. That goes for our civilian professionals as well as the career military.
As I've said, this is personal for me. The Biden family is a military family. We learned firsthand some of what your loved ones experienced when Beau was deployed to Iraq for a year with his unit in the Delaware National Guard. We dealt with the stress of his absence and the daily joys—from the daily joys of life. And we worried constantly about his safe return. We felt overwhelming pride in his courage and his patriotism.
You are all the best our country has to offer. You live by a creed of selfless sacrifice. And for many of you, the journey to service has not been easy.
February is Black History Month, as the Vice President pointed out. Before we leave today, Vice President Harris and I are going to visit the hall honoring the long history of Black Americans fighting for this country, even when their contributions were not always recognized or honored appropriately.
But those contributions have nevertheless helped push our country toward greater equality. From the bravery of the free and enslaved descendants of Africans who fought with the colonial forces in our revolution; to the Black regiments that joined to fight for the Union and for their own freedom in the Civil War; to the Buffalo soldiers, including Henry O. Flipper, the first African American graduate of West Point; and Cathay Williams, the first African American woman—Cathay—who enlisted in the United States Army. Imagine the incredible love it must have taken for the proud Tuskegee Airmen to fly more than 15,000 sorties in battle, when their own freedom was not fully realized in their own country. Imagine the determination of Roscoe Robinson, who started at West Point 1 year before Harry Truman issued the order to officially desegregate the Armed Forces, and who rose to become the first African American four-star general. Imagine the bravery of the 22 African Americans awarded the Medal of Honor for their service in the Vietnam war while struggling for civil rights at home was continuing. It's all part of a long history of barrier-breaking service.
Right now more than 40 percent of our Active Duty forces are people of color. And it's long past time that the full diversity and full strength of our force is reflected at every level of this Department, including our Secretary of Defense.
This organization thrives and succeeds because of our people. So the final point I'd like to make today is to give you my personal commitment that this administration—from myself and the Vice President Harris to Secretary Austin on down—is dedicated to ensuring that every single person is treated with dignity and respect.
That's why we moved so quickly to overturn the discriminatory ban on transgender service, and why General Austin's first memo was a directive to take sexual assault in the military seriously. Every single person, no matter their gender identity, sexual orientation, race, or religious background, deserves to feel safe in the ranks and to have their contributions valued.
It's on all of us to stand up, to speak out when you see someone being abused. This is an organization that's defined American—excuse me, defeated American enemies on land, sea, and air and been defined by the way we treat others. So I know this is not beyond us, not if each of us makes this a priority as well.
So thank you for welcoming us, Secretary Austin. It's good to be back in the Pentagon. I wish I could meet more of you in person today, but I look forward to spending more time with you in all the places you serve around the world.
I know this is the honor of my lifetime. The honor of my lifetime is to serve as your Commander in Chief.
Thank you for what you do for this country. May God bless you and protect you, and may God protect our troops deployed around the world, every single one of you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 3:20 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq James F. Jeffrey.

10-Feb-21,Remarks on the Situation in Burma,"Thank you for being here on short notice. I'm going to be very brief, but I—because the Vice President and I are heading over the Pentagon for an extensive briefing and to make some comments, as we did at the State Department. So I'm going to be going from here to there, and you'll get me there as well.
I want to say good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to give you an update on the latest regarding our response to the military coup in Burma.
As you know, the assault on Burma's transition to democracy remains an issue of deep bipartisan concern. We've consulted at length, for example, with Senator McConnell, who's had a very keen interest in this, and his team. And we welcome their helpful insights.
We've also been in close contact with our allies and partners around the world, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, driving vigorous diplomatic outreach to help coordinate an international response to what happened. A strong and unified message emerging from the United States has been essential, in our view, to encouraging other countries to join us in pressing for an immediate return to democracy.
Last week, the United States helped bring together the U.N. Security Council, which issued a strong statement in support of Burmese democracy. And this week, we will use our renewed engagement on the Human Rights Council to strengthen the world's commitment to human rights in Burma.
Today I again call on the Burmese military to immediately release the democratic political leaders and activists and—that they're now detaining, including Aung San Suu Kyi. And she is—and also Win Myint, the President. The military must relinquish the power it seized and demonstrate respect for the will of the people of Burma as expressed in their November 8 election.
So today I'm announcing a series of actions that are—we're taking to begin imposing consequences on the leaders of the coup. The U.S. Government is taking steps to prevent the generals from improperly having access to the $1 billion in Burmese Government funds held in the United States. And today I've approved a new Executive order——
[At this point, the President coughed.]
——excuse me—a new Executive order enabling us to immediately sanction the military leaders who directed the coup, their business interests, as well as close family members.
We will identify a first round of targets this week. And we're also going to impose strong exports controls. And we're freezing U.S. assets that benefit the Burmese Government, while maintaining our support for health care, civil society groups, and other areas that benefit the people of Burma directly.
And finally, as protests grow, violence against those asserting their democratic rights is unacceptable, and we're going to keep calling it out. The people of Burma are making their voices heard. And the world is watching. We'll be ready to impose additional measures, and we'll continue to work with our international partners to urge other nations to join us in these efforts. So I thank you all. I wanted to have that statement before I got in the vehicle to go out to the Pentagon. And I'm sure I'll see some of you at the Pentagon. Thanks for coming over on such short notice. Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 1:22 p.m. in the South Court Auditorium of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building.

9-Feb-21,Remarks and an Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Business Leaders on the American Rescue Plan,"The President. Hello, folks. Thanks for coming in. I've invited in some of the leading businesspeople in America to come in and talk about the state of the economy, our recovery package. We're going to talk a little bit, God willing, about infrastructure down the road, and also about the—a little about the minimum wage. But I want to thank each of them for being here and participating.
I think they're—as I've said before—you've heard me say it to labor groups and others as well—that the American people are hurting. There's a lot of people who are in real, real trouble. A lot of people going to bed at night, staring at the ceiling wondering whether they're going to be in that apartment the next day or if they're going to be evicted or if they're going to keep their mortgage payment up, if they're going to have any health insurance. We've got millions of people unemployed.
As Secretary Yellen has pointed out, we have a scarring effect that may be going on and can get worse. We have kids not in school. There's a whole range of issues, but I think they're all soluble. I think they're all within our capacity.
As you know, I've met for a long time with my Republican colleagues. I've been exchanging correspondence with them and telephone calls, as well, to see if there's any way we can follow up beyond where we are, and meeting with the Members of the House and the Senate as well. And I think we're in a position to think big and move big and to move in a direction that can not only get the economy back on its feet, but we have to get people well before we get people on their feet. And we've focused a lot of the attention on making sure that we deal with the coronavirus, get it under control.
As you know, you've been through it all in detail with me on what we're doing on the coronavirus and the funding mechanisms that exist within this package, as well as we have to deal at the same time with the employment. We have to deal at the same time with business and growth of the economy. We can't let one wait. We can't get everybody well and then move on the economy. We have to move quickly on both.
And I'm anxious to hear what these business leaders have to say about how they think I'm approaching this issue, we're approaching this issue, and to see if we can find some common ground. I know I've found some common ground with some of my Republican friends and a lot of the Democrats as well, so I'm optimistic.
So thank you all for coming in. I appreciate it.
Senate Impeachment Trial of Former President Donald J. Trump/Federal Coronavirus Response 
Q. Mr. President, just briefly on impeachment.
Q. Will you watch President Trump's trial?
Q. Just briefly on impeachment, do you mind?
Q. Will you watch the trial? Are you going to watch the trial?
The President. I am not. Look, I told you before: I have a job. My job is to keep people—we've already lost over 450,000 people. We're going to lose a whole lot more if we don't act and act decisively and quickly. A lot of people, as I said, are going—a lot of children are going to be hungry. A lot of families are food insecure. They're in trouble. That's my job. The Senate has their job; they're about to begin it. I'm sure they're going to conduct themselves well. And that's all I'm going to have to say about impeachment.
So thank you very, very much. Appreciate it.

8-Feb-21,"Remarks During a Virtual Tour of the State Farm Stadium Vaccination Site in Glendale, Arizona","White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeffrey D. Zients. Good afternoon, Mr. President and Madam Vice President. On your second day in office, you announced a comprehensive national strategy to fight the pandemic. Importantly, you called for a whole-of-Government approach. Central to that strategy, you directed your team to activate the full resources of the Federal Government to get more shots in arms. We immediately got to work. First, to increase vaccine supply. Second, to get more vaccinators in the field. And third, to create more places where Americans can get vaccinated.
[At this point, Coordinator Zients continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
So now let me introduce you to Dr. Christ, the Director of the Arizona Department of Health Services.
Dr. Christ, over to you.
Arizona Department of Health Services Director Cara M. Christ. Good afternoon, and we are so honored to have you here at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. I want to take you into the command tent, where we manage the day-to-day operations of the State's only 24/7 State-operated vaccination site. So come on in.
[Director Christ continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
And in the next couple of weeks, we will be opening up our third pod down in Pima County, which is Tucson, our second most populous county here in Arizona.
I'm happy to take any questions that you may have.
The President. Doctor, let me ask you—this is Joe Biden. Let me ask you a question. Were you able to do this—would you be able to do this without Federal help? The reason I ask it is, a lot of States originally said: ""We're fine. We don't need any help. We'll—just get us the vaccine, and we'll be fine."" Talk to me practically about what it took to get it to this stage.
Director Christ. So, without the Federal funding and without the Federal partnership, this would be a huge logistical lift. And so, the fact that we've got such great partnership with our Federal partners—whether it's FEMA, whether it's HHS—that has been just—that's been the crux.
And so, without that funding and the vaccine and the vaccinators that have come out here, along with all of the logistical support that we've gotten—it's a huge lift to put something like this together.
The President. Why did you decide on this site for the drive-thru?
Director Christ. So that is a great question, Mr. President. I—one of the things is our partnership with the Arizona Cardinals. So Michael Bidwill and the Cardinals have been strong partners throughout the COVID response. We actually had a testing site, in partnership here at—with ASU, Arizona State University, as well as the Arizona Cardinals. So we had some of the infrastructure and the plans in place to then build into a vaccination site. But it's also got great freeway access. Everybody knows where it is. We can do freeway signs so that people can easily navigate into the parking lot. And with the NFL season in Arizona being over, it was the perfect partnership.
The President. I got a call during the Super Bowl from the commissioner of football, and—offering us, the Federal Government, the 30 major stadiums. So I think they're going to be coming to you to look at how you did it because you're doing such a great job.
One last question. Do you—I was pleased and a little surprised to hear that if a caretaker drove somebody, or if I assume a family member drove someone who qualifies to get the shot, they would also qualify as well. Is that correct?
Director Christ. Yes, it's a clinical decision made onsite, at the time. It depends on our vaccine supply and the capacity that we have at the site to be able to register that additional person. But we really try.
We know that people are in constant contact with family members and loved ones. And the more we can do to surround them with vaccinated people, like their caretaker, it just keeps people safer.
The President. Well, one of the things you may recall—the Vice President and I announced about 15 days ago that we were going to try and get 100 million shots in 100 days into the people's arms. We found out we didn't quite have the supply of vaccine we thought initially. We're all set now, but we're exceeding that number.
And so because of folks like you, who are dedicated—and I just want to—before I turn it over to the Vice President—she may have some questions—I just want to thank you for your dedication. You're saving people's lives, short term and long term. So thank you, thank you, thank you. I'm looking forward to meeting you one day.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Hi, Doctor. I join the President: thank you, thank you. This is an incredible model.
How are you reaching out to your hardest hit communities and those who may have a difficult time with transportation or just, proportionally, are some of the hardest hit but maybe not receiving the vaccine at the greatest numbers? What kind of outreach are you doing?
The President. We lost you, Doc.
Vice President Harris. Uh-oh. You're muted.
Director Christ. Am I good right now?
The President. You're good. [Laughter]
Director Christ. Okay, perfect. Okay, sorry—the technical.
So that is a really great question, Madam Vice President, and something that, here in Arizona, we feel strongly about. So this is just one portion of our State vaccination plan. So we are looking to partner with community leaders to put community-based pods in some of those hard-to-reach and targeted ZIP Codes. We have contracted with communications groups that specialize in reaching our Hispanic/Latino or our hard-to-reach populations to do intense communication about the importance of vaccine.
We're also working with our State's Medicaid program to ensure that we've got nonmedical transport available that they can use if they want to come out here to one of these sites or any other sites. And we're also taking advantage of the CDC's retail pharmacy partnership to make sure that we're getting those vaccines into pharmacies in hard-to-hit areas, as well as our community health centers. And so that's just a little bit about the plan, but we definitely are trying to target those populations because we know how at risk they are.
Vice President Harris. And my other question is the: What's the proportion—do you have a sense—of the folks that are getting the first vaccine versus the second vaccine?
Director Christ. So we here are very surprised at how willing people are to get that second-dose vaccine. So we've been—that was one of our lessons learned here at State Farm Stadium: We register people for their second dose before they actually leave this site. And prior, we had been just telling them we would e-mail them.
That has been great. We have a high demand for second dose. And we actually take people who are looking to get their second dose, but can't find it somewhere else, here at State Farm as walk-ins.
Vice President Harris. That's great. Thank you for your work. And to your whole team, thank them.
The President. Doing a great job, Doc.
Director Christ. All right, well, now I am going to hand it over to Brittney, who is our lead clinical supervisor. She is out at the vaccination tents, and I know she's looking forward to talking with you.
The President. Thank you.
Arizona State University Vaccination Pod Head Charge Nurse Brittney Hayes. Hi, I'm Brittney Hayes. I'm with Arizona State University. I'm the head charge nurse here at the vaccination pod at State Farm Stadium.
[Ms. Hayes continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
And then, as far as some of the successes, I mean, we're vaccinating one vaccine per 10 seconds, so I feel like that is very impressive, and we are giving people hope—giving volunteers and staff purpose. And then, feeling united. This has been a long year, and I'm just thrilled that we can give that unity back.
Back to you.
The President. We're really proud of you.
Ms. Hayes. Thank you. Thank you, sir.
The President. No, I really mean it.
Tell me about the number of volunteers. Are these pure volunteers? Do they get per diem or are they pure volunteers?
Ms. Hayes. [Inaudible]—for our volunteers. I'm not exactly sure everything that goes into that process, but over 50 percent of probably what is on my vaccination pods here are volunteers. All of our datafication people are volunteers.
The President. And when someone comes through in a vehicle, do they have to demonstrate proof of eligibility or have they also been cleared before they get to that tent?
Ms. Hayes. That's what I'm for—the charge nurse. I have dedicated that to them to make that decision. If they have allergies or something along those lines—immunocompromised, if they had COVID and had the convalescent plasma—that's my job to dig a little deeper than what the assessment of the vaccinator is and to really see that they are eligible, because I want to give the vaccine to everybody possible.
The President. Now, in Arizona, what is the age eligibility for coming through that tent?
Ms. Hayes. So we are—since we are doing the Pfizer vaccine, it is 16 and over, but the 16 and over have to be—the appointment needs to be made online. If they are a walk-in, it does have to be 18 or older due to them just being minors.
The President. Right. And what do you hear from the folks coming through that get the vaccine—that actually get the shot in their arm? What are the kind of things you most often hear from them or your volunteers hear?
Ms. Hayes. They're amazed—yes, no. I'm sorry. They're amazed by the process, the smoothness. I hear that a lot. I hear a lot of other touching stories, you know, that people have gone through due to COVID. And you know, they're here, and really we're instilling hope. A ""dose of hope"" is what I've been calling it. I've heard a—yes, but the smoothness of the process is what I hear most.
The President. Last question I have: How can we best support you and other frontline workers?
Ms. Hayes. That's a great question. So the collaboration that I have with FEMA, DEMA, all of the other State—everybody that I've partnered with here, I get nothing but the utmost support, and it's been amazing to collaborate with everybody. They check in. If I need something, it's done. They know that I'm trying to do everything to make this safe and efficient. So, support, yes.
The President. Well, are you a freshman at the university? [Laughter]
Ms. Hayes. No. No. [Laughter]
The President. I'm teasing. [Laughter]
Ms. Hayes. No.
The President. You look like a freshman.
Ms. Hayes. Why, thank you.
The President. Well, no, thank you for what you're doing. It really matters. As I said to the Doc last—a few moments ago, Dr. Christ, we committed when we got in that—we were short on vaccines and short on organization, and—when we got sworn in. And we committed to do 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days, and we're exceeding that. With the grace of God, the good will of the neighbors, and help of people like you, we're going to end up doing more than that. So thank you for what you're doing. You're saving people's lives.
Ms. Hayes. Absolutely. And I'm more than happy to be here.
The President. I'm going to turn it over to the Vice President. She's got the tough questions.
Ms. Hayes. Oh, okay.
Vice President Harris. [Laughter] Hi, Brittney.
Ms. Hayes. Hi.
Vice President Harris. Hi, thank you for everything you're doing. You are a role model of how this kind of approach can work, and thank you for that, because it's not easy being a role model and being one of the first. But that being said, you're a leader, really, in the country around what you're experiencing right now and how that can help others that start to pop up. And we intend on doing this around—in many places around the country.
So what would your advice be to others who are setting up an operation like yours? What did you learn worked and what didn't work? So we can learn from whatever you have experienced. Ms. Hayes. I think—like I said, one of my biggest challenges was staffing and just how to incorporate—I feel like I have incorporated things that I had worked, you know, as a bedside nurse: getting a huddle together, getting a process together. I have made a actual ""charge binder""—is what I have been calling it—that has everything my charge nurse would need to know to be able to run the site efficiently.
And then, I'm always available for questions and support. I think that's the biggest thing—is to let them know they are not alone in making decisions and— being able to keep our patrons and staff safe.
Vice President Harris. That's great. Thank you so very much. You're doing it, and you're making a huge difference, and you are inspiring all of us. So thank you for everything you are doing. It really does matter in such a big way.
Thank you.
Ms. Hayes. Thank you.
The President. And you're a—are you a nurse?
Ms. Hayes. I am. I'm a nurse. I'm an RN. I've been an RN for about 9 years now.
The President. Well, I know, having been a significant consumer of health care, I can tell—I know the Vice President knows this, when I say it: Doctors let you live; nurses make you want to live. If there's any angels in Heaven, they're all nurses, male and female. And that's not an exaggeration.
Vice President Harris. That's right.
The President. That's the God's truth. Thank you for all you do.
Ms. Hayes. Thank you very much.
The President. Thank you. Okay. Keep it going.
Ms. Hayes. I'm going to turn it back to Dr. Christ.
The President. Okay.
Vice President Harris. Okay.
Director Christ. Thank you so much, Brittney. She is one of our most dedicated nurses out here, but we have such a great team behind us. You can see—this is the site behind us. It takes about 30 minutes to go, from the time you pull on to the time you leave.
But with me, I have our Acting Regional Administrator for FEMA, Tammy Littrell, and the head of the Arizona National Guard, Major General Michael McGuire. So I'm going to turn it over to Tammy.
Federal Emergency Management Agency Acting Regional Administrator Tammy L. Littrell. Good afternoon, Mr. President and Madam Vice President. It is such an honor today to be a part of this State's initiative to stand up what I call one of the most efficient and effective vaccination centers. To just be able to see the—all levels of Government and the private sector, as well as all the volunteers, come together to help the American people get vaccinated is going to help us, as a FEMA team, be able to go back to California and be able to set up our vaccination centers in Oakland and in Los Angeles next week.
[Acting Regional Administrator Littrell continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
With that, sir, I believe another—I'd like to just take a moment just to share two examples that we have heard of, and that is the Navajo Nation.
The President. Yes.
Acting Regional Administrator Littrell. So as we support the Navajo Nation, we are going to stand up four vaccination centers. This will help increase their access to the vaccination, as well as take the burden off of their Tribal members from having to drive in these austere winter conditions that they are experiencing right now.
[Acting Regional Administrator Littrell continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
So with that, I also want to just close with thanking you, Mr. President and Madam Vice President, for your leadership in leading the way.
The President. Well, thank you.
Vice President Harris. Thank you.
Acting Regional Administrator Littrell. I will now turn it back over to you, Mr. President.
The President. Well, first of all, thank you. You're doing one heck of a job. One of the things that when we started to try to figure out what we were going to do when we came into office, because there wasn't much of a transition—we didn't have—we weren't given a lot of information. And some of the information we had turned out not to be accurate in terms of vaccine supplies. And we met virtually with all the Governors, and the Governors basically said, ""Just send us the vaccine; we'll take care of it."" And the fact is, I think they and everyone else vastly underestimated the logistical needs that go with having the vaccine—assuming you have enough vaccine.
And so one of the first things we did was we called in FEMA and also contacted every Governor, General, and told them that we'll pay for the National Guard, it won't be their expense, because you guys are—and women are badly needed. And in addition to that, the Defense Department has allocated over 1,000—they're going to go up to 100,000 people who are going to be helping along—10,000 people who are helping along the way.
So I just want to thank you for the coordination. I mentioned this to Dr. Christ a little earlier, but the coordination is really—it really matters. And we've got people who know what they're doing, starting with the Doc and you too, both with FEMA and—well, the National Guard. That that's your business. You know how to get it done. And so—and you are really doing it.
I just think what you put together is amazing. Our hope is that we're going to be able to not only get—keep the commitment to get 100 million shots in people's arms by the first 100 days—I think we'll get—we'll exceed that considerably—but also to—we've now been able to go out and talk with—personally with the vaccine manufacturers. They've upped significantly the commitments to the amount of vaccine they'll produce and when it will be produced. And so I—and things are beginning to click. People are beginning to feel that they can find their way to get the vaccine.
And lastly, one of the most important things for us—and you mentioned what's happening on the Navajo Tribe; I've met with the leaders—is that it really—it really does matter that we have access to the people who are most in need, but are—and most affected by the COVID crisis, dying at faster rates, getting sick at faster rates, and—but not being available, not being able to get into the mix. And so equity is a big thing, and I want to thank you all three of you—for engaging in that.
But I don't—we didn't hear from—I'm going to turn this over to the Vice President. But, General, I hope we're going to hear from you as well after the Vice President says something to—whatever she wants to say. Okay?
Vice President Harris. Thank you, Mr. President. Just a quick question, Ms. Littrell. Can you talk a little bit about what you think will be the challenges in terms of the mobile units and what will be the strengths of that? Because, again, we're going to be watching these first rollouts as a model for what we do in other places. So, from the ground, what do you see as being the challenges and the strengths of that operation around mobile units?
Acting Regional Administrator Littrell. Sure. I would start with the strengths only because I've talked to our CDC partners and the public health professionals, where, at first, I thought we were going to have—you know, be using or depending upon our—just our mobile command vehicles out of our detachment—our MERS detachments out of FEMA, which they are still going to assist and help us because they have the means to technology where we can take on the road and then also be able to allow those who need to enroll, be able to do so at ease.
But after talking with CDC and the public health professionals, they educated us and let us know that there are mobile operations within the public health sector that are really good at mobile operations.
So we're going to maximize as much as we possibly can and not just lean on our own understanding, our own FEMA resources in order to go mobile. So a lot to learn still, but we're staying optimistic that we're going to once again be able to come together and be able to reach those who need us the most.
Vice President Harris. Thank you. Thank you.
Acting Regional Administrator Littrell. Thank you, ma'am.
The President. General, how you doing?
Arizona National Guard Adjutant General Major General Michael T. McGuire, USAF. I'm doing good, Mr. President. How are you today?
The President. Better for seeing you, man. [Laughter]
Adjutant General McGuire. Well, we appreciate the partnership with FEMA and all the DOD, all our Federal partners who have been out here—IHS, HHS—all the things that have happened.
[Adjutant General McGuire continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
So thanks for all you're doing there on the Federal team, and I look forward to continue to replicate this around Arizona, and hope plagiarism is the highest form of flattery. That's what we say. So if everyone wants to copy what Arizona is doing, we think we've got it figured it out here. So thanks, sir.
The President. Well, you sure have it figured out at that spot, General. And thank you for all you've done, and thank you for what you do. And you probably have been deployed with your group several times in the last 10 years, so thank you for that as well.
Adjutant General McGuire. Yes, sir.
The President. Madam Vice President.
Vice President Harris. Thank you, General. Thank you very much for all—and please thank all your troops for us.
Thank you.
Adjutant General McGuire. Yes, ma'am.
The President. And, Dr. Christ, thank you for the tour and to meet some of your frontline workers. I—you know, I'm sorry that we weren't in a position that the Governor could be with us today, but he's been very, very cooperative and very helpful. He's stepped up.
And this is the kind of partnership between the Federal and State Governments that I think—and the private sector—to help us vaccinate more people more quickly, and to get ahead of this virus instead of behind it.
And we're optimistic that we have enough—we'll have enough of the vaccine in the pipeline to be able to provide shots for over—including double shots for over 300 million people before we get through the summer. At least that's our hope. And it includes getting vaccines to the pharmacies—as you pointed out to me earlier, Doc—and vaccination centers like the one you have there. And we're going to need—if we need more vaccinators, we'll send them, we'll find them for you. So let us know.
And again, I want to thank you very, very much for your leadership. I look forward to—I wish we were in a situation—it sounds—it's counterintuitive—because of COVID, we can't see you—come and see you, which we'd ordinarily be doing—getting on a plane and coming out and looking firsthand. But you know, the fact is that you're the reason why we're going to beat this disease. And we will beat it.
You know, big or small, we're going to do whatever it takes to reach and surpass our goal of over 100 million in 100 days. And there's a lot to do, and it's going to take time. We're going to face some setbacks along the way, including the complication of the strains that we're seeing from South Africa and other places. But I know we can do it. We've never failed as a country when we've done things together. Never, ever, ever, ever fail when united. And you guys are the example of unity. So thank you, thank you, thank you.
Madam Vice President.
Vice President Harris. Well, thank you all. As one of the first of this example of the partnership between the Federal Government, State, local, you all really are a model. And there are folks around the country who are going to benefit from the work you all are doing on the ground in Arizona—people who may not know your name, people you may not meet, but are going to be forever benefited because of your around-the-clock, hard work. You are taking this on as a personal mission on behalf of folks who need your help, and you are there to do what's necessary.
So thank you. Together with Governor Ducey, Senator Sinema, and Kelly, and so many others, I think we're showing how when we are unified, we can get a lot of good work done.
So thank you all.
The President. There's no such thing as a red State or a blue State when it comes to COVID. There's no such thing as Democrat or Republican——
Vice President Harris. That's right.
The President. ——when it comes to COVID. When we stand united, there's not a damn thing we've been unable to do. And you're the—you're a perfect example of that.
So thanks again. Stay safe. Stay safe. And thank you.
Vice President Harris. Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at approximately 2:40 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to Roger S. Goodell, commissioner, National Football League (NFL).

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/347973 ",,,,,,,,,,,
5-Feb-21,Remarks on Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation,"Thank you for your patience. We had a very good but long meeting with the chairpersons of the House of Representatives in the Oval, and it went a little longer, but it went very well. Thank you all for being here.
I'm accompanied by the Vice President and the Secretary of Treasury, Janet Yellen, and I want to talk today about our plan.
And the January jobs numbers came out today. And while we are grateful for everyone who found work and is earning a paycheck, it is very clear, our economy is still in trouble. We added just 6,000 private sector jobs in the country last month. Overall, we added 49,000 jobs. And this at a time when we have more than 10 million people out of work, 4 million people have been out of work for 6 months or longer, and 2.5 million women have been driven from the workforce. Fifteen million Americans are behind in their rental payments. Twenty-four million adults and twelve million children literally don't have enough food to eat.
These aren't Democrats or Republicans, they're Americans. And they're suffering. And they're suffering not because of anything they did. Through no fault of their own, they're suffering. A once-in-a-century virus has decimated our economy, and it's still wreaking havoc on our economy today. And so much of it is still about the virus. We're still in the teeth of this pandemic. In fact, January was the single deadliest month of the whole pandemic. We lost nearly 100,000 lives.
I know some in Congress think we've already done enough to deal with the crisis in the country. Others think that things are getting better and we can afford to sit back and either do a little or do nothing at all. That's not what I see. I see enormous pain this country. A lot of folks out of work. A lot of folks going hungry, staring at the ceiling tonight wondering, ""What am I going to do tomorrow?"" A lot of folks trying to figure out how to keep their jobs and take care of their children. A lot of folks reaching the breaking point.
Suicides are up. Mental health needs are increasing. Violence against women and children is increasing. A lot of folks are losing hope. And I believe the American people are looking right now to their Government for help, to do our job, to not to let them down. So I'm going to act, and I'm going to act fast.
I'd like to be doing it with the support of Republicans. I've met with Republicans. There's some really fine people who want to get something done, but they're just not willing to go as far as I think we have to go.
I've told both Republicans and Democrats that's my preference: to work together. But if I have to choose between getting help right now to Americans who are hurting so badly and getting dragged—bogged down in a lengthy negotiation or compromising on a bill that's up to the crisis, that's an easy choice. I'm going to help the American people who are hurting now.
That's why I'm so grateful to the House and Senate for moving so fast on the American Rescue Plan. Here's what's in that plan:
First, it puts $160 billion into our national COVID-19 strategy, which includes more money for manufacturing, distribution, and setting up of vaccination sites—everything that's needed to get vaccines into people's arms. There is simply nothing more important than us getting the resources we need to vaccinate the people in this country as soon, as quickly as possible. So job number one of the American Rescue Plan is vaccines. Vaccines.
The second, the American Rescue Plan is going to keep the commitment of $2,000: $600 has already gone out; $1,400 checks to people who need it. This is money directly in people's pockets. They need it. We need to target that money. So folks making $300,000 don't get any windfall. But if you're a two—if you're a family that's a two-wage earner, each of the parents—one making 30 grand and one making 40 or 50—maybe that's a little more than—well, yes, they need the money, and they're going to get it.
And here's what I won't do: I'm not cutting the size of the checks. They're going to be $1,400. Period. That's what the American people were promised.
And very quickly, here's the rest of my plan:
It has money for food and nutrition so that folks don't go hungry. I think our Republican friends are going to support that. It extends unemployment insurance, which is going to run out on March 13 of this year, to the end of September of this year, because there is still going to be—we're still going to have high unemployment.
It helps small businesses, thousands of whom have had to go out of business. It has money to help folks pay their health insurance. It has rental assistance to keep people in their homes, rather than being thrown out in the street. It's got money to help us open our schools safely. It has money for childcare, for paid leave. It gets needed resources to State and local governments to prevent layoffs of essential personnel: firefighters, nurses, folks that are schoolteachers, sanitation workers. It raises the minimum wage. It's big, and it's bold. And it's a real answer to the crisis we're in.
And it's one more thing. And I want to say it very clearly on this—be very clear on this point: It's better economics. It not only addresses the immediate crisis we're in, it's better for the long-term economic health of our Nation and our competitiveness.
My plan creates more jobs, it creates more economic growth, and does more to make us competitive with the rest of the world than any other plan. Don't take my word for it. Just look at what leading economists across the Nation have said—and the world, and across the ocean have said.
Wall Street investment firm Moody's says if we pass the American Rescue Plan, it will lead to 4 million more jobs than otherwise would be created. The nonpartisan Brookings Institution has looked at the Rescue—American Rescue Plan—and said the GDP of—will reach prepandemic projections by 2021, meaning we'll have recovered by the end of 2021. And much sooner, by the way, than if we do nothing.
Look, just this week, the Congressional Budget Office projected that if we don't take action, it would take until the year 2025 to return to full employment.
There's also a growing chorus of top economists—right, center, left—that say we should be less focused on the deficit and more focused on the investments we make and can make now in jobs, keeping families out of poverty, and preventing long-term economic damage to our Nation.
The simple truth is, if we make these investments now, with interest rates at historic lows, we'll generate more growth, higher incomes, a stronger economy, and our Nation's finances will be in a stronger position as well. And the payoff won't just be in jobs, but in our global competitiveness as well, because we'll be regaining our economic strength faster.
So the way I see it: The biggest risk is not going too big, if we go—it's if we go too small. We've been here before. When this Nation hit the Great Recession that Barack and I inherited in 2009, I was asked to lead the effort on the economic Recovery Act to get it passed. It was a big recovery package, roughly $800 billion. I did everything I could to get it passed, including getting three Republicans to change their votes and vote for it.
But it wasn't enough. It wasn't quite big enough. It stemmed the crisis, but the recovery could have been faster and even bigger. Today, we need an answer that meets the challenge of this crisis, not one that falls short. And that's the issue facing the country right now.
What Republicans have proposed is either to do nothing or not enough. All of a sudden, many of them have rediscovered fiscal restraint and the concern for the deficits. But don't kid yourself: This approach will come with a cost: more pain for more people, for longer than it has to be.
Secretary Yellen talks about the scarring effect that comes with prolonged economic pain. We see that scarring effect in economic data. But more important, we can see it in the lives of people living with long-term unemployment, living in hunger, at wits' end over how to keep their jobs and take care of their kids. And then, she talks about the need to alleviate long-term suffering in the economy. We can do that. We don't have to wait until 2025 to get back to full employment, which will be the case if we don't do this.
Again, independent analysis from places like Moody's, on Wall Street, the Brookings Institution—the American Rescue Plan could achieve that by the beginning—full employment by the beginning of next year.
So, to me, this is what this moment comes down to. Are we going to pass a big enough package to vaccinate people, to get people back to work, to alleviate the suffering in this country this year? That's what I want to do. Or are we going to say to millions of Americans who are out of work, many of whom have been out of work for 6 months or longer, who have been scarred by this economic and public health crisis: ""Don't worry, hang on. Things are going to get better. We're going to go smaller, so it's just going to take us a lot longer""? Like, until 2025. That's the Republican answer right now.
I can't in good conscience do that. Too many people in the Nation have already suffered for too long through this pandemic and economic crisis. And telling them we don't have the money to alleviate their suffering, to get to full employment sooner, to vaccinate America after $8 trillion in deficit spending over the past 4 years—much of it having gone to the wealthiest people in the country—is neither true nor necessary.
We do have the resources to get to full employment sooner. We do have the tools to reduce a lot of suffering in this country. We just have to choose to use them.
So it's time to act. We can reduce suffering in this country. We can put people back to work. We can control—gain control of this virus. That's what the American Rescue Plan does. And that's what I'm determined to do, and that's what I hope we're going to be able to do in the near term.
So may God bless you all, may God protect our troops. And I truly believe real help is on the way. Thank you all so very much. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, how could you better target who gets the $1,400 check?","NOTE: The President spoke at 12:22 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the White House.

5-Feb-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With House Democratic Leaders To Discuss Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation,"We're going to be talking about the recovery package, but we saw the jobs report that only 6,000 private sector jobs have been created. And at that rate, it's going to take 10 years before we get to full employment. That's not hyperbole, that's a fact. We're going to be in a situation where it'll take a long, long time.
And I appreciate you all coming over because—and the urgency with which you're moving—this is about people's lives. This is not just about numbers; this is about people's lives. People are—I don't have to tell any of you, they're really hurting. People are being evicted.
Just look at all the number of people who are needing and seeking mental health services now. Suicide is up. People are very—really, really—drug abuse, violence against women. People are really feeling the hole. They don't know how to get out. You've given them a lot of hope—a lot of hope—and with the—as they say in Southern Delaware: the grace of God and the good will of the neighbor, with the crick not rising, we can really begin to do something consequential here.
So I want to thank you all. And what I—you know, President—President Obama put me in charge of the Recovery Act, and it was hard as hell to get the votes for it to begin with, and then it was hard as hell to get even the number we got. But one thing we learned is, you know, we can't do too much here; we can do too little. We can do too little and sputter.
But again, the end result is, it's not just the macroeconomic impact on the economy and our ability to compete internationally, it's people's lives. Real, live people are hurting, and we can fix it. And we can fix it. And the irony of all ironies is, when we help them, we are also helping our competitive capacity through the remainder of this decade. I mean, it's real.
So we've got a chance to do something big here. And I'm—and thank you for last night, yesterday, and what you're going to be doing on this Recovery Act. And I can hardly wait to sit down with Peter DeFazio to work on infrastructure. [Laughter] This is the next big piece.

4-Feb-21,Remarks on United States Foreign Policy at the Department of State,"Mr. Secretary, it's great to be here with you. And I've been looking forward a long time to be able to call you ""Mr. Secretary.""
Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honor to be back at the State Department under the eyes of the first American chief diplomat, Benjamin Franklin. And by the way, I want you all to know in the press I was the Benjamin Franklin Professor of Presidential Politics at Penn. And I thought they did that because I was as old as he was, but I guess not.
Anyway, all kidding aside, it's great to be here and stand alongside our most recent senior diplomat, Secretary Tony Blinken. Mr. Secretary, thank you for welcoming us today. We've worked together for over 20 years. Your diplomatic skills are respected equally by your friends and our competitors around the world.
And they know when you speak, you speak for me. And so is the message I want the world to hear today: America is back. America is back. Diplomacy is back at the center of our foreign policy.
As I said in my Inaugural Address, we will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again, not to meet yesterday's challenges, but today's and tomorrow's. American leadership must meet this new moment of advancing authoritarianism, including the growing ambitions of China to rival the United States and the determination of Russia to damage and disrupt our democracy.
We must meet the new moment accelerating global challenges—from the pandemic to the climate crisis to nuclear proliferation—challenging the will only to be solved by nations working together and in common. We can't do it alone.
That must be this—we must start with diplomacy rooted in America's most cherished democratic values: defending freedom, championing opportunity, upholding universal rights, respecting the rule of law, and treating every person with dignity. That's the grounding wire of our global policy—our global power. That's our inexhaustible source of strength. That's America's abiding advantage.
Though many of these values have come under intense pressure in recent years, even pushed to the brink in the last few weeks, the American people are going to emerge from this moment stronger, more determined, and better equipped to unite the world in fighting to defend democracy, because we have fought for it ourselves.
Over the past few days, we've been in close cooperation with our allies and partners to bring together the international community to address the military coup in Burma. I've also been in touch with Leader McConnell to discuss our shared concerns about the situation in Burma, and we are united in our resolve. There can be no doubt: In a democracy, force should never seek to overrule the will of the people or attempt to erase the outcome of a credible election.
The Burmese military should relinquish power they have seized, release the advocates and activists and officials they have detained, lift the restrictions on telecommunications, and refrain from violence. As I said earlier this week, we will work with our partners to support restoration of democracy and the rule of law, and impose consequences on those responsible.
Over the past 2 weeks, I've spoken with the leaders of many of our closest friends—Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Germany, France, NATO, Japan, South Korea, Australia—to being [begin]Over the past 2 weeks, I've spoken with the leaders of many of our closest friends—Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Germany, France, NATO, Japan, South Korea, Australia—to being [begin]* reforming the habits of cooperation and rebuilding the muscle of democratic alliances that have atrophied over the past few years of neglect and, I would argue, abuse. American alliances are our greatest asset, and leading with diplomacy means standing shoulder to shoulder with our allies and key partners once again.
By leading with diplomacy, we must also mean engaging our adversaries and our competitors diplomatically, where it's in our interest, and advance the security of the American people. That's why yesterday the United States and Russia agreed to extend the New START Treaty for 5 years to preserve the only remaining treaty between our countries safeguarding nuclear stability.
At the same time, I made it clear to President Putin, in a manner very different from my predecessor, that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions—interfering with our elections, cyber attacks, poisoning its citizens—are over. We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia and defend our vital interests and our people. And we will be more effective in dealing with Russia when we work in coalition and coordination with other like-minded partners.
The politically motivated jailing of Alexei Navalny and the Russian efforts to suppress freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are a matter of deep concern to us and the international community. Mr. Navalny, like all Russian citizens, is entitled to his rights under the Russian constitution. He's been targeted—targeted—for exposing corruption. He should be released immediately and without condition.
And we'll also take on directly the challenges posed by our prosperity, security, and democratic values by our most serious competitor, China. We'll confront China's economic abuses; counter its aggressive, coercive action; to push back on China's attack on human rights, intellectual property, and global governance.
But we are ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so. We will compete from a position of strength by building back better at home, working with our allies and partners, renewing our role in international institutions, and reclaiming our credibility and moral authority, much of which has been lost.
That's why we've moved quickly to begin restoring American engagement internationally and earn back our leadership position, to catalyze global action on shared challenges.
On day one, I signed the paperwork to rejoin the Paris climate agreement. We're taking steps led by the example of integrating climate objectives across all of our diplomacy and raise the ambition of our climate targets. That way, we can challenge other nations, other major emitters, up to—to up the ante on their own commitments. I'll be hosting climate leaders—a climate leaders' summit to address the climate crisis on Earth Day of this year. America must lead in the face of this existential threat. And just as with the pandemic, it requires global cooperation.
We've also reengaged with the World Health Organization. That way, we can build better global preparedness to counter COVID-19, as well as detect and prevent future pandemics, because there will be more.
We've elevated the status of cyber issues within our Government, including appointing the first national—Deputy National Security Adviser for Cyber and Emerging Technology. We're launching an urgent initiative to improve our capability, readiness, and resilience in cyberspace. Today I'm announcing additional steps to course-correct our foreign policy and better unite our democratic values with our diplomatic leadership. To begin, Defense Secretary Austin will be leading a Global Posture Review of our forces so that our military footprint is appropriately aligned with our foreign policy and national security priorities. It will be coordinated across all elements of our national security, with Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken working in close cooperation.
And while this review is taking place, we'll be stopping any planned troop withdrawals from Germany. We're also stepping up our diplomacy to end the war in Yemen, a war which has created a humanitarian and strategic catastrophe. I've asked my Middle East team to ensure our support for the United Nations-led initiative to impose a cease-fire, open humanitarian channels, and restore long-dormant peace talks.
This morning Secretary Blinken appointed Tim Lenderking, a career foreign policy officer, as our Special Envoy to the Yemen conflict. And I appreciate his doing this. Tim is a life—has lifelong experience in the region, and he'll work with the U.N. Envoy and all parties of the conflict to push for a diplomatic resolution.
And Tim's diplomacy will be bolstered by USI—USAID, working to ensure that humanitarian aid is reaching the Yemeni people who are suffering unendurable devastation. This war has to end. And to underscore our commitment, we are ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arm sales.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia faces missile attacks, UAV strikes, and other threats from Iranian-supplied forces in multiple countries. We're going to continue to support and help Saudi Arabia defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity and its people.
We also face a crisis of more than 80 million displaced people suffering all around the world. The United States moral leadership on refugee issues was a point of bipartisan consensus for so many decades when I first got here. We shined the light of lamp on—of liberty on oppressed people. We offered safe havens for those fleeing violence or persecution. And our example pushed other nations to open wide their doors as well.
So today I'm approving an Executive order to begin the hard work of restoring our refugee admissions program to help meet the unprecedented global need. It's going to take time to rebuild what has been so badly damaged, but that's precisely what we're going to do.
This Executive order will position us to be able to raise the refugee admissions back up to 125,000 persons for the first full fiscal year of the Biden-Harris administration. And I'm directing the State Department to consult with Congress about making a downpayment on that commitment as soon as possible.
And to further repair our moral leadership, I'm also issuing a Presidential memo to agencies to reinvigorate our leadership on the LGBTQI issues and do it internationally. You know, we'll ensure diplomacy and foreign assistance are working to promote the rights of those individuals, included by combatting criminalization and protecting LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers.
And finally, to successfully reassert our diplomacy and keep Americans safe, prosperous, and free, we must restore the health and morale of our foreign policy institutions. I want the people who work in this building and our Embassies and consulates around the world to know: I value your expertise and I respect you, and I will have your back. This administration is going to empower you to do your jobs, not target or politicize you. We want a rigorous debate that brings all perspectives and makes room for dissent. That's how we'll get the best possible policy outcomes. So, with your help, the United States will again lead not just by the example of our power, but the power of our example. That's why my administration has already taken the important step to live our domestic values at home—our democratic values at home. Within hours of taking office, I signed an Executive order overturning the hateful, discriminatory Muslim ban; reversed the ban on transgender individuals serving in our military.
And as part of our commitment to truth, transparency, and accountability, we stated on day one—we started on day one with daily briefings of the press from the White House. We've reinstituted regular briefings here at State and at the Pentagon. We believe a free press isn't an adversary; rather, it's essential. A free press is essential to the health of a democracy.
We've restored our commitment to science and to create policies grounded in facts and evidence. I suspect Ben Franklin would approve.
We've taken steps to acknowledge and address systemic racism and the scourge of White supremacy in our own country. Racial equity will not just be an issue for one department in our administration, it has to be the business of the whole of Government in all our Federal policies and institutions.
All this matters to foreign policy, because when we host the Summit of Democracies early in my administration to rally the nations of the world to defend democracy globally, to push back the authoritarianism's advance, we'll be a much more credible partner because of these efforts to shore up our own foundations.
There's no longer a bright line between foreign and domestic policy. Every action we take in our conduct abroad, we must take with American working families in mind. Advancing a foreign policy for the middle class demands urgent focus on our domestic economic renewal.
And that's why I immediately put forth the American Rescue Plan to pull us out of this economic crisis. That's why I signed an Executive order strengthening our ""Buy American"" policies last week. And it's also why I'll work with Congress to make far-reaching investments in research and development of transformable—in transformable technologies. These investments are going to create jobs, maintain America's competitive edge globally, and ensure all Americans share in the dividends.
If we invest in ourselves and our people, if we fight to ensure that American businesses are positioned to compete and win on the global stage, if the rules of international trade aren't stacked against us, if our workers and intellectual property are protected, then there's no country on Earth—not China or any other country on Earth—that can match us.
Investing in our diplomacy isn't something we do just because it's the right thing to do for the world. We do it in order to live in peace, security, and prosperity. We do it because it's in our own naked self-interest. When we strengthen our alliances, we amplify our power as well as our ability to disrupt threats before they can reach our shores.
When we invest in economic development of countries, we create new markets for our products and reduce the likelihood of instability, violence, and mass migrations. When we strengthen health systems in far regions of the world, we reduce the risk of future pandemics that can threaten our people and our economy.
When we defend equal rights of people the world over—of women and girls, LGBTQ individuals, indigenous communities, and people with disabilities, the people of every ethnic background and religion—we also ensure that those rights are protected for our own children here in America. America cannot afford to be absent any longer on the world stage. I come today to the State Department, an agency as old and as storied as the Nation itself, because diplomacy has always been essential to how American—America writes its own destiny.
For the diplomacy of Ben Franklin helped assure the success of our revolution. The vision of the Marshall Plan helped prevent the world from foundering on the wreckage of war. And the passions of Eleanor Roosevelt declared the audacious idea of universal rights that belong to all.
The leadership of diplomats of every stripe, doing the daily work of engagement, created the very idea of a free and interconnected world. We are a country that does big things. American diplomacy makes it happen. And our administration is ready to take up the mantle and lead once again.
Thank you all. And may God bless you and protect our troops, our diplomats, and our development experts, and all Americans serving in harm's way.
Going this way. Thank you all.","NOTE: The President spoke at 2:45 p.m. in the Benjamin Franklin State Dining Room of the Harry S. Truman Building at the U.S. Department of State Headquarters.

4-Feb-21,Remarks to Staff at the Department of State,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you for welcoming the Vice President and me back to the State Department.
It's true, the Secretary and I have worked together a long time. And I know that he has the background and the capacity needed to, quite frankly, lead the State Department at a critical moment.
This has been a difficult few years. I've been hanging around as—on the Foreign Relations Committee and—as chairman, and then as Vice President, and now as President, for a long time dealing with State.
Those of you who work here, and including the new class of diplomats that we—that are on the screen behind me: You're among the brightest, most involved, best educated group of people America has to offer.
And—but I come today to talk to everyone at Main State watching remotely and those who will not be able to see this, but will hear about it.
You know, an incredible group of diplomats that I've had a chance to work with—and what we never talk about is, you not only have great intellectual capacity, you have great personal courage. I've been with some of you when we've been shot at. I've been with some of you when we've been in places that you would have—not have any idea you'd want to be when you were going to school of foreign policy and foreign service. They never told you what—that was going to happen. But you're an incredible group of individuals.
And I've said many times over the years: Those of you who are stationed overseas and have been stationed overseas, you're America's face. You're what people see and the country you are. They look at you. You are the face of America, and it matters. It matters a great deal how you comport yourself and how you deal with the folks that you're dealing with in that particular country.
I find it—many of you among the most—and by the way, I think what we don't do enough: We don't thank your families. We don't thank your families for the sacrifices they make. They make sacrifice—real sacrifices. I don't know how many times I have moved—again, moved to see to it that—your spouses, they give up their careers many times to follow you. Many times, their careers are as consequential or more consequential than yours, but they do it for the country. And they're to be thanked.
But the main message that I want to communicate to you all is that whether you're part of the newest class of Foreign Service officers or you've worked for decades in the Civil Service or Foreign Service or you're locally employed staff, you're vital, and the success and strength of our nation depends in no small part on you.
Later today I'm going to go up on the eighth floor and send a clear message to the world: America is back. America is back. Diplomacy is back. You are the center of all that I intend to do. You are the heart of it. We're going to rebuild our alliances. We're going to reengage the world and take on the enormous challenge we face dealing with a pandemic, dealing with global warming, and again, standing up for democracy and human rights around the world. Again, as I said, you're the face of America abroad. And in our administration, you're going to be trusted, and you're going to be empowered—trusted and empowered—to do your job.
But I ask each of you to abide by a few core tenets: Integrity in all you do. Let me say it again: Integrity in all you do. Transparency and accountability to rebuild trust in America around the world. Working in the service of the American people, not self-interest. And promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility across the board, because our diplomats, at all levels, should reflect the full diversity of this great country.
I know how much we ask of you and your families, and I mean that. I do know. It's been a long time I've been dealing with this building and all of your predecessors. And the sacrifices you make are real and not recognized much by the country as a whole. They don't know all that you do.
I also know that you've never let us down. I believe in you. I believe in you. We need you badly. I trust you. And I'm going to have your back—that I promise you—just like you're going to have the backs of the American people.
What I always point out to people in the years when I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I'd make sure that my Foreign Relations Committee staff came to my home State and worked on constituent services, which many of them thought was sort of beneath them. ""I'm a foreign policy specialist."" But it's all about who you work for—who I work for, who we work for—and the foreign policy is about promoting the interests of the people of the United States within a rubric and a set of principles that treat everyone with decency.
So I promise you I'm going to have your back. I promise you. And I expect you to have the back of the American people.
Now, I've got a lot of work to do and a lot of catching up to do, a lot of rebuilding to do. And I can't think of any group of people better capable of doing it, more ready than all of you.
So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I look forward to working with you, I look forward to seeing you, and I look forward to coming back when this auditorium is filled and no one has to wipe down the podium. [Laughter]
So, again, folks, thank you. You are the heart and soul of who we are as a country, and the rest of the world is looking to you to help them understand us and so we can help them as well.
So thank you all very much, and may God bless you, and may God keep you all safe when you're abroad. Thank you.",NOTE: The President spoke at 1:45 p.m. in the Harry S.

2-Feb-21,Remarks on Signing Executive Orders on Immigration Reform and an Exchange With Reporters,"Shooting of Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents in Sunrise, Florida 
The President. Well, let me begin by saying, from all three of us—the Vice President, the new Secretary of Homeland Security—that our hearts go out to the families of these FBI special agents and—two of whom were killed and three of whom were injured today in Florida.
I was briefed on this tragedy earlier today, and I know the FBI is gathering information about how this happened, what happened. But I can only imagine how these families are feeling today.
You know, one of the things, when you are in a combat zone of the military or you're a FBI agent or military or a police officer, every family just—when they put that shield on and go out in the morning—dreads the possibility of a call—receiving that phone call. And my heart aches for the families. I've not had an opportunity, nor will I try today, to contact them.
But they put their lives on the line, and it's a hell of a price to pay. And every single day, every single one of these folks get up, and they—by and large, the vast, vast majority of these men and women are decent, honorable people who put themselves on the line, and we owe them.
Senate Confirmation of Alejandro N. Mayorkas as Secretary of Homeland Security 
But the purpose of my asking you here today is, I want to congratulate the new Secretary. Secretary Mayorkas is going to take on an easy job—nothing to it: Homeland Security. And going to deal—I'm looking forward to his leadership and working with Congress on a lot of issues, including the immigration bill that has, I think, great support in both Chambers.
Immigration Reform/The President's Use of Executive Actions 
Today I'm going to sign a few Executive orders to strengthen our immigration system, building on the Executive actions I took on day one to protect DREAMers and to end the Muslim ban and to better manage of our borders. And that's what these three different Executive orders are about.
And I want to make it clear—there's a lot of talk, with good reason, about the number of Executive orders that I have signed—I'm not making new law; I'm eliminating bad policy. What I'm doing is taking on the issues that—99 percent of them—that the President—the last President of the United States issued Executive orders I felt were very counterproductive to our security, counterproductive to who we are as a country, particularly in the area of immigration.
This is about how America is safer, stronger, more prosperous when we have a fair, orderly, and humane legal immigration system. And with the first action today, we're going to work to undo the moral and national shame of the previous administration that literally, not figuratively, ripped children from the arms of their families—their mothers and fathers at the border—and with no plan, none whatsoever, to reunify the children who are still in custody and their parents.
The second action addresses the root causes of our—migration to our southern border.
And the third action—the third order I'm going to be signing—orders a full review of the previous administration's harmful and counterproductive immigration policies, basically across the board. And so, with that, I'm going to sign the first order, which is the reestablishment of an Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families.
It removes the stain on our reputation for what these separations caused.
[At this point, the President Signed an Executive order titled ""Establishment of Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families.""]
That is the first order.
The second order I'm signing is: ""Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework To Address the Causes of Migration and To Manage Migration Throughout the North and Central America and To Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border.""
[The President signed the Executive order.]
And the third order I'm signing is: ""Restoring the Faith in Our Legal Immigration System and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans.""
[The President signed the Executive order.]
As my grandfather would say: By the grace of God and the good will of neighbors, we'll reunite these children and reestablish our reputation as being a haven for people in need.
Thank you very, very much.

Q. Mr. President, why are you going to Walter Reed?
The President. I'm going out to visit some of the soldiers and sailors that are—been wounded and look at the vaccination procedure.
I've been at Walter Reed a lot. I spent almost 6 months there myself as a patient. And in addition to that, as Vice President, every single Christmas, we spent all of Christmas Day at Walter Reed. These kids are amazing.
And thank God there's not as many people to visit, so all the people I'm seeing today, who are being treated, or—four of them amputees—are people who, in fact, are retired and—but they're real heroes.
And then, we're going to go see the vaccination distribution. So they're—I spent a lot of time at Walter Reed. They're great Americans. They're great people.

29-Jan-21,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Well, folks, I'm going to have a discussion here with Secretary Yellen and my economic team to discuss the economic consequences of the Congress failing to pass our American Rescue Plan. There is an overwhelming consensus among economists left, right, and center that this is a unique moment in this crisis, and the cost of inaction is high, and it's growing every day.
The crisis itself is accelerating. Nine hundred thousand more Americans filed unemployment—for unemployment insurance in this week alone. Thirty million Americans don't have enough food to eat this week.
And interest rates are at historic lows, and the return on smart investments in the economy have never been higher. And it's not just me saying this; as I said, it's the consensus among the vast majority of leading economists in the country—as I said, left, right, and center—including advisers to former President Trump and George W. Bush.
And so I've been meeting all morning with other folks as well. The notion here is the—we have to act now; it's—there's no time for any delay. And so we can end up with 4 million fewer jobs this year, according to Moody's, a Wall Street firm, and it could take a year longer to return to full employment if we don't act and don't act now.
We could see an entire cohort of kids with a lower lifetime earnings because they're deprived of another semester of school. Millions of parents and maybe some of you—millions of parents are—particularly moms—are forced to stay home, reducing the family wages. And if they're a single-wage earner, it's really difficult. And future job prospects that—they have no choice but to stay home and take care of their children. Millions of people are out of work, unemployed. Future millions of—are held back for no good reason other than our failure to act.
So the choice couldn't be clearer. We have learned from past crises the risk is not doing too much; the risk is not doing enough. And this is the time to act now.
And I've asked Secretary Yellen, who has been leading this effort, to come in, and we're going to go into some detail among ourselves, but I think she has a statement to make as well.
Secretary Yellen. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you, Madam Secretary.
Secretary Yellen. Well, there is a huge amount of pain in our economy right now, and it was evident in the data released yesterday. Over a million people applied for unemployment insurance last week, and that's far more than in the worst week of the Great Recession. And economists agree that if there's not more help, many more people will lose their small businesses, the roofs over their heads, and the ability to feed their families. And we need to help those people before the virus is brought under control.
The President's American Rescue Plan will help millions of people make it to the other side of this pandemic, and it will also make some smart investments to get our economy back on track.
I want to emphasize—the President is absolutely right—the price of doing nothing is much higher than the price of doing something and doing something big. We need to act now, and the benefits of acting now and acting big will far outweigh the costs in the long run.
Coronavirus Vaccine Development/Coronavirus Relief Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, what do you think of the Johnson and Johnson results?
The President. I'm waiting to hear from my team—I'm waiting to hear from the team on the detail of it. I saw the news reported this morning. I haven't had a chance to speak with Dr. Fauci.
One point I want to make that the Secretary made—now let's get this straight: It's not only that people will be badly, badly hurt if we don't pass this package, in terms of increased rate of death, in terms of poverty—a whole range of things—but we will also be hurt long term, economically—economically.
We need to make this investment so the economy can grow the remainder of this year and next year. The investments now will help the economy grow. It will not, in fact, put—be a—put a drag on the economy, us spending this money. It will do the exact opposite.
So thank you all very much.","NOTE: The President spoke at 11:21 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White House.

28-Jan-21,Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on Strengthening Medicaid and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a Memorandum on Protecting Women's Health at Home and Abroad and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Since we are socially distanced, I think I can take my mask off to make this very brief announcement. I know that you've been briefed by the health care team about what this is about. And there is an easy and quick way for us to describe this.
It's been a busy week, and I've signed Executive orders tackling COVID-19, the economic and climate crises, as well as advancing racial equity.
But today I'm about to sign two Executive orders that are—basically, the best way to describe them, to undo the damage Trump has done. There's nothing new that we're doing here, other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring the Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became President, which by fiat he changed—made more inaccessible, more expensive, and more difficult for people to qualify for either of those two items: the Affordable Care Act or Medicaid.
And the second order I'm going to be signing also changes what the President has done—the President—what the former President has done. And it—a memorandum reversed the—my predecessor's attack on women's health——
[At this point, the President coughed.]
——excuse me—health access. And as we continue to battle COVID-19, it's even more critical that Americans have meaningful access to health care.
And so that's what I'm about to do. And again, I'm not initiating any new law, any new aspect of the law. This is going back to what the situation was prior to the President's Executive orders.
And the first one I'm going to be signing here is to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. And of all times that we need to reinstate access to, affordability of, and extent of access to Medicaid is now, in the middle of this COVID crisis.
[The President signed an Executive order titled ""Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act"".]
And the second order I'm singing relates to protecting women's health at home and abroad, and it reinstates the changes that were made to title 10 and other things, making it harder for women to have access to affordable health care as it relates to their reproductive rights.
[The President signed a memorandum on protecting women's health at home and abroad.]

27-Jan-21,"Remarks on Efforts To Combat Climate Change, Create Jobs, and Promote Scientific Integrity","The President. Good afternoon, everybody. I know the press has just had a long session with the team here about what I'm going to be talking about today and this afternoon.
And let me just start by saying, I can't tell you how much I appreciate the three people standing next to me here for what they've agreed to do to help, particularly my best buddy, John Kerry. Asking a former Secretary of State to come back and do this has been a—I know it was a big ask on the part of myself. I was going to blame Kamala for it as well, but for both of us.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Why not? [Laughter]
The President. And—but John has been deeply involved; the Secretary has been deeply involved in climate issues as a Senator and one of the leaders, legislatively, as well. And I don't think anybody knows more about the issue and the damage that's been done by some of the Executive orders of the previous administration.
And Gina—you've run everything, Gina. Thank you very much.
Let me get to it. Today is ""Climate Day"" at the White House and—which means that today is ""Jobs Day"" at the White House. We're talking about American innovation, American products, American labor. And we're talking about the health of our families and cleaner water, cleaner air, and cleaner communities. We're talking about national security and America leading the world in a clean energy future.
It's a future of enormous hope and opportunity. It's about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we—that's now facing us—climate change—with a greater sense of urgency. In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis and we can't wait any longer. We see it with our own eyes, we feel it, we know it in our bones, and it's time to act.
And I might note, parenthetically: If you notice, the attitude of the American people toward greater impetus on focusing on climate change and doing something about it has increased across the board: Democrat, Republican, Independent. It's—that's why I'm signing today an Executive Order to supercharge our administration's ambitious plan to confront the existential threat of climate change. It is an existential threat.
Last year, wildfires burned more than 5,000 acres in the West—as no one knows better than the Vice President, a former Senator from California—an area roughly the size of the entire State of New Jersey. More intense and powerful hurricanes and tropical storms pummeled States across the Gulf Coast and along the East Coast—I can testify to that, from Delaware. Historic floods, severe droughts have ravaged the Midwest. More Americans see and feel the devastation in big cities, small towns, coastlines, and in farmlands, in red States and blue States. And the Defense Department reported that climate change is a direct threat to more than two thirds of the military's operational critical installations. Two thirds. And so this could—we could—this could well be on the conservative side.
And many climate and health calamities are colliding all at once. It's not just the pandemic that keeps people inside; it's poor air quality. Multiple studies have shown that air pollution is associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19. And just like we need a unified national response to COVID-19, we desperately need a unified national response to the climate crisis because there is a climate crisis. We must keep—we must lead global response because neither challenge can be met, as Secretary Kerry has pointed out many times, by the United States alone. We know what to do; we've just got to do it.
When we think of climate change, we think of it—this is a case where conscience and convenience cross paths, where dealing with this existential threat to the planet and increasing our economic growth and prosperity are one in the same. When I think of climate change, I think of—and the answers to it—I think of jobs.
A key plank of our Build Back Better Recovery Plan is building a modern, resilient climate infrastructure and clean energy future that will create millions of good-paying union jobs, not 7, 8, 10, 12 dollars an hour, but prevailing wage and benefits.
You know, we can put millions of Americans to work modernizing our water systems, transportation, our energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme climate. We've already reached a point where we're going to have to live with what it is now. That's going to require a lot of work all by itself, without it getting any worse.
When we think of renewable energy, we see American manufacturing, American workers racing to lead the global market. We see farmers making American agriculture first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions and gaining new sources of income in the process. And I want to parenthetically thank the Secretary of Agriculture for helping to put together that program during the campaign.
We see small business and master electricians designing, installing, and innovating energy-conserving technologies and building homes and buildings. And we're going to reduce electric consumption and save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs in the process.
And when the previous administration reversed the Obama-Biden vehicle standard and picked Big Oil companies over American workers, the Biden-Harris administration will not only bring those standards back, we'll set new, ambitious ones that our workers are ready to meet.
We see these workers building new buildings, installing 500,000 new electric vehicle charging stations across the country as we modernize our highway systems to adapt to the changes that have already taken place. We see American consumers switching to electric vehicles through rebates and incentives and the residents of our cities and towns breathing cleaner air and fewer kids living with asthma and dying from it.
And not only that, the Federal Government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles, as you all know. With today's Executive order, combined with the ""Buy American"" Executive order I signed on Monday, we're going to harness the purchasing power of the Federal Government to buy clean, zero-emission vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in America.
With everything I just mentioned, this will mean 1 million new jobs in the American automobile industry—1 million. And we'll do another thing: We'll take steps towards my goal of achieving 100-percent carbon-pollution-free electric sector by 2035. Transforming the American electric sector to produce power without carbon pollution will be a tremendous spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century, not to mention the benefits to our health and to our environment.
Already, 84 percent of all new electric capacity planned to come onto the electric grid this is year is clean energy. Clean energy. Why? Because it's affordable; because it's clean; because, in many cases, it's cheaper. And it's the way we're keeping up—they're keeping up. We're going to need scientists, the national labs, land-grant universities, Historical Black Colleges and Universities to innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit clean electric—clean electricity across distances and battery technology and a whole range of other things.
We need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them. We need iron workers and welders to install them. Technologies they invent, design, and build will ultimately become cheaper than any other kind of energy, helping us dramatically expand our economy and create more jobs with a cleaner, cleaner environment. And we'll become the world's largest exporter of those technologies, creating even more jobs.
You know, we are also—we're going to build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that are going to benefit communities three times over: one, by alleviating affordable—the affordable housing crisis; two, by increasing energy efficiency; and, three, by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to home ownership.
We're also going to create more than a quarter-million jobs to do things like plug the millions of abandoned oil and gas wells that pose an ongoing threat to the health and safety of our communities. They're abandoned wells that are open now, and we're going to put people to work. They're not going to lose jobs in these areas, they're going to create jobs. They're going to get prevailing wage to cap those over a million wells. These aren't pie-in-the-sky dreams. These are concrete, actionable solutions, and we know how to do this.
The Obama-Biden administration reduced the auto industry—rescued the auto industry and helped them retool. We need solar energy cost-competitive with traditional energy, weatherizing more—we made them cost-competitive, weatherizing more than a million homes.
The Recovery Act of our administration—the last administration—our administration, the Democratic administration made record clean energy investments: $90 billion. The President asked me to make sure how that money was spent, on everything from smart grid systems to clean energy manufacturing.
Now, the Biden-Harris administration is going to do it again and go beyond. The Executive order I'll be signing establishes a White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy. And it will be led by one of America's most distinguished climate leaders, former EPA Director Gina McCarthy. As the head of the new office and my National Climate Adviser, Gina will chair a National Climate Task Force, made up of many members of our Cabinet, to deliver a whole-of-Government approach to the climate crisis.
This is not—it's not time for small measures; we need to be bold. So let me be clear: That includes helping revitalize the economies of coal, oil, and gas, and power plant communities. We have to start by creating new, good-paying jobs, capping those abandoned wells, reclaiming mines, turning old brownfield sites into new hubs of economic growth, creating new, good-paying jobs in those communities where those workers live because they helped build this country.
We're never going to forget the men and women who dug the coal and built the Nation. We're going to do right by them, make sure they have opportunities to keep building the Nation and their own communities and getting paid well for it.
While the whole-of-Government approach is necessary, though, it's not sufficient. We're going to work with mayors and Governors and Tribal leaders and business leaders who are stepping up and the young people organizing and leading the way. My message to those young people is: You have your—the full capacity and power of the Federal Government. Your Government is going to work with you. Now, today's Executive order also directs the Secretary of the Interior to stop issuing new oil and gas leases on public lands and offshore waters, wherever possible. We're going to review and reset the oil and gas leasing program.
Like the previous administration, we'll start to properly manage—unlike it, we're going to start to properly manage lands and waterways in ways that allow us to protect, preserve them—the full value that they provide for us for future generations.
Let me be clear, and I know this will—always comes up: We're not going to ban fracking. We'll protect jobs and grow jobs, including through stronger standards, like controls from methane leaks and union workers in—willing to install the changes.
Unlike previous administrations, I don't think the Federal Government should give handouts to Big Oil to the tune of $40 billion in fossil fuel subsidies. And I'm going to be going to the Congress asking them to eliminate those subsidies.
We're going to take money and invest it in clean energy jobs in America, millions of jobs in wind, solar, and carbon capture. In fact, today's actions are going to help us increase renewable energy production from offshore wind and meet our obligation to be good stewards of our public lands.
It establishes a new, modern-day Civilian Climate Corps—that I called for when I was campaigning—to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods.
Look, this Executive order I'm signing today also makes it official that climate change will be at the center of our national security and foreign policy.
As Secretary Kerry—as our Special Presidential Envoy for Climate—with him, the world knows how serious I am about one of America's—by appointing one of America's most distinguished statesmen and one of my closest friends, speaking for America on one of the most pressing threats of our time. John was instrumental in negotiating the Paris Climate Agreement that we started to—that we rejoined—this administration rejoined on day one, as I promised.
And today's Executive order will help strengthen that commitment by working with other nations to support the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change and to increase our collective resilience. That includes a summit of world leaders that I'll convene to address this climate crisis on Earth Day, this year. In order to establish a new effort to integrate the security implications of climate change as part of our national security and risk assessment and analysis will also be included.
With this Executive order, environmental justice will be at the center of all we do addressing the disproportionate health and environmental and economic impacts on communities of color—so-called ""fenceline communities""—especially those communities—Brown, Black, Native American, poor Whites. It's hard—the hard-hit areas like Cancer Alley in Louisiana or the Route 9 corridor in the State of Delaware.
That's why we're going to work to make sure that they receive 40 percent of the benefits of key Federal investments in clean energy, clean water, and wastewater infrastructure. Lifting up these communities makes us all stronger as a Nation and increases the health of everybody.
Finally, as with our fight against COVID-19, we will listen to the science and protect the integrity of our Federal response to the climate crisis. Earlier this month, I nominated Dr. Eric Lander, a brilliant scientist who is here today, to be the Director of the Office of Science and Technology. I also nominated another brilliant scientist, Dr. Frances Arnold and Dr. Maria Zuber, to co-chair the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology—so-called ""PCAST""—that President Eisenhower started 6 weeks after the launch of Sputnik. It's a team of America's top scientists charged with asking the most American of questions: ""What next? What's the next big breakthrough?"" And then, helping us make the impossible possible.
Today I'm signing a Presidential memorandum making it clear that we will protect our world-class scientists from political interference and ensure they can think, research, and speak freely and directly to me, the Vice President, and the American people.
To summarize, this Executive order—it's about jobs—good-paying union jobs. It's about workers building our economy back better than before. It's a whole-of-Government approach to put climate change at the center of our domestic, national security, and foreign policy. It's advancing conservation; revitalizing communities and cities and in the—on the farmlands; and securing environmental justice.
Our plans are ambitious, but we are America. We're bold. We are unwavering in the pursuit of jobs and innovation, science and discovery. We can do this, we must do this, and we will do this.
I'm now going to sign the Executive order to meet the climate crisis with American jobs and American ingenuity. And I want to thank you all. I'm going to go over and sign that now.
I'll use the right pens here.
The first order I'm signing is tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad.
[At this point, the President signed an Executive order titled ""Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad.""]
This next one: restoring trust in Government through science and integrity and evidence-based policy making.
[The President signed a memorandum on restoring trust in Government through scientific integrity and evidence-based policymaking.]
One more here. And this last one is the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, establishing.
[The President signed an Executive order titled ""President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.""]
I thank you all for your time.

In his remarks, he referred to Secretary of Agriculture-designate Thomas J. Vilsack.","Joseph R.

26-Jan-21,Remarks on Efforts To Contain the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Thank you for taking the time to be here. Good afternoon.
I'm accompanied by Jeff Zients, who is heading up our whole COVID team. And today what I'd like to do is to upgrade—update you on where we are. Tomorrow we're going to begin the briefings that are going to occur on a regular basis with Mr. Zients and his team. So we're bringing back the pros to talk about COVID in an unvarnished way. Any questions you have, that's how we'll handle them, because we're letting science speak again.
And so I'd like to update you on the aggressive steps we're taking to meet our goal of administering 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots within a hundred days and to ramp up the vaccine supply as fast as we can. This will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we've ever undertaken as a nation. I've said that before, but I must say it again because we're going to do—we're going to do everything we can to get it done. But a lot of things can go wrong along the way.
And so I've—as I've said in the past, we want to give credit to everyone involved in this vaccine effort and the prior administration and the science community and the medical sphere——
[At this point, technical equipment falling to the floor could be heard off camera.]
——for getting the program—I didn't do it, I promise—[laughter]—for getting the program off the ground. And that credit is absolutely due.
But it's also no secret that we have recently discovered, in the final days of the transition—and it wasn't until the final days we got the kind of cooperation we needed—that once we arrived, the vaccine program is in worse shape than we anticipated or expected. A lot of you who follow this—and nobody is—I mean this sincerely, the press is the smartest group of people in town; you hone this stuff down, clearly—I think you found the same thing.
Even before I took office, I announced a new vaccine—a vaccination strategy which centers on Federal leadership and execution for our whole country. And that's why I directed my COVID team to go to work immediately on how we could step up the vaccination efforts and the vaccinations.
I'm pleased to announce the first progress in that work today on day 7 of my Presidency. First, after review of the current vaccine supply and manufacturing plants, I can announce that we will increase overall weekly vaccination distribution to States, Tribes, and Territories from 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses, starting next week. That's an increase of 1.4 million doses per week.
And you all know—if I may note, parenthetically—you all know that the vaccines are distributed to States based on population. They're based on population. And so the smaller the State, the less vaccine; the bigger the State, the more they get. And so this is going to allow millions of more Americans to get vaccinated sooner than previously anticipated. We've got a long way to go though.
The second thing: We're increasing the transparency with States, cities, and Tribes, and local partners when it comes to the vaccine supply. This is something we've heard over and over again from both Democrats and Republicans, State and local leaders: that they need a plan in order to what—they didn't know what they had to plan on. They need to know what the order is going to be. Jeff had a meeting with the Governors on Zoom and—and others. And I think we're getting this coordinated in a way that there's increased cooperation and confidence.
But until now, we've had to guess how much vaccine to expect for the next week. And that's what the Governors had to do: ""How much am I getting next week?"" This is unacceptable. They—you know, the lives are at stake here. From this week forward, God willing, we'll ensure that States, Tribes, and Territories will now always have a reliable 3-week forecast on what the supply they're going to get. So they'll know, 3 weeks ahead of time, what's going to be there in the third week.
This is going to help make sure Governors, mayors, and local leaders have greater certainty around supply so they can carry out their plans to vaccinate as many people as possible. So we will both increase the supply in the short term by more than 15 percent and give our States and local partners more certainty about when the deliveries will arrive. These two steps are going to help increase our prospects of hitting and—or exceeding, God willing, the ambitious goal of 100 million shots in 100 days.
But I also want to be clear: 100 million shots in 100 days is not the endpoint; it's just the start. We're not stopping there. The end goal is to beat COVID-19. And the way we do that is to get more people vaccinated, which means we have to be ready, after we hit the ground—we have to hit the goal of 100 million shots in 100 days.
Now, that means fewer than 100 million people getting totally vaccinated; it means 100 [million]* shots, and it means somewhere between 60—maybe less, maybe more—million people will have the—because it requires two shots in many cases, not always.
So today I'm directing COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients, here, to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to increase our total supply of vaccine for the American people. And we believe that we'll soon be able to confirm the purchase of an additional hundred billion [million]* doses for each of the two FDA-authorized vaccines: Pfizer and Moderna. That's 100 million more doses of Pfizer and 100 million more doses of Moderna, 200 million more doses than the Federal Government had previously secured. Not in hand yet, but ordered.
We expect these additional 200 million doses to be delivered this summer. And some of it will come as early—begin to come in early summer, but by the mid—by the midsummer, that this vaccine will be there. And the order—and that increases the total vaccine order in the United States by 50 percent—from 400 million ordered to 600 million.
This is enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 Americans by the end of the summer, beginning of the fall. But we want to make—look, that's—I want to repeat: It will be enough to fully vaccinate 300 [million]* Americans to beat this pandemic—300 million Americans. And this is aggregate plan that doesn't leave anything on the table or anything to chance, as we've seen happen in the past year.
I've said before: This is a wartime effort. When I say that, people ask, ""Wartime?"" I say, ""Yes, more than 400,000 Americans have already died."" I think it's four-hundred-eleven or -twelve [thousand]* have died in one year of this pandemic—more than all the people who died in all of—Americans who died in World War II. This is a wartime undertaking; it's not hyperbole. And as such, I directed the team to be ready to exercise all the authorities I have under the Defense Production Act, and expedite these vaccines. And we're using the Defense Production Act to launch a full-scale, wartime effort to address the supply shortages we inherited from the previous administration.
We're going to be working across the Government, with private industry, to ramp up production of vaccine and protective equipment—the syringes, the needles, the gloves, the swabs, the masks—everything that's needed to protect, test, vaccinate, and take care of our people. Well, we've already identified suppliers, and we're working with them to move our plan forward.
The biggest problem—I hope you're all asking me by the end of the summer that: ""You have too much vaccine left over. You have too much equipment leftover."" That's not my worry. I hope that becomes the problem, rather than we somehow find interruptions in supply or access.
These aggressive steps to increase vaccine supply come on top of the steps we took last week to get more people vaccinated for free, to create more places for them to get vaccinated, and to mobilize more medical teams to get shots in people's arms.
We've directed FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to stand up the first federally supported community vaccination centers, and that work is underway. We're working to make vaccines available to thousands of local pharmacies, beginning in early February; it's a couple weeks off. And we—that will enormously expand our reach.
Last week, I also signed a declaration to immediately begin reimbursing States 100 percent for the uses of their National Guard to help the COVID relief effort, both getting people—getting the sites set up and even using some of their personnel to administer some of the vaccines. And I think it's something Democrats and Republicans and Governors alike have called for.
We're also expanding testing, which will help schools and businesses reopen safely and protect the most vulnerable.
And we formalized the Health Equity Task Force to ensure that equity is at the core of everything we do in urban and rural communities alike, to make sure those people most significantly damaged have—have access. Access. We have to change. We have to move in a direction for those communities that are hard to get to.
But the brutal truth is: It's going to take months before we can get the majority of Americans vaccinated. Months. In the next few months, masks—not vaccines—are the best defense against COVID-19. Experts say that wearing masks from now just until April would save 50,000 lives who otherwise will pass away if we don't wear these masks. That's why I'm asking the American people to mask up for the first hundred days. I've issued Executive orders requiring masks on Federal property and interstate travel: trains and planes and buses.
One Congressman pointed out—I could—well, he used a very, anyway, colorful term to say wearing a mask—""I tell him to kiss my ear; I'm not going to wear a mask."" Well, guess what? Not very American. The fact is, you want to be patriotic; you're going to protect people. And new COVID-19 variants are—we are instituting new measures to deal with these individuals flying into the United States from other countries.
You've all hold—if you could hold a second—you've all heard about the strain—the British strain, the Brazilian strain, the South African strain. And they are—they seem to be more transmittable more easily. So, in addition to wearing masks, everyone flying to the United States from another country, we need to test before they get on that plane and self-quarantine when they arrive in America.
I'm going to close with this: I now have a national—we now have a national strategy to beat COVID-19. It's comprehensive. It's based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial. And it is detailed. It's going to require Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan to provide funding to administer the vaccines, to ramp up testing, to help schools and businesses reopen, and to deliver immediate economic relief to Americans who are in—badly in need of it through no fault of their own.
And our plan will take time. Progress from our plan will take time to measure, as people getting infected today don't show up in case counts for weeks, and those who perish from those—from the disease die weeks after that exposure. You know, despite the best—our best intentions, we're going to face setbacks, which I will always explain to you and acknowledge.
And let me be clear: Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better. The death toll, experts tell us, is likely to top 500,000 by the end of next month—this February—and cases will continue to mount. We didn't get into this mess overnight, and it's going to take months for us to turn things around. But let me be equally clear: We're going to get through this. We will defeat this pandemic.
And to a nation waiting for action, let me be clearest on this point: Help is on the way. We can do this if we come together, if we listen to the scientists. And as I said: Tomorrow, I say to the press, the entire team will be back in the business of—my COVID team—of answering all your detailed questions.
So thank you very much for your patience. Keep the faith. We're going to get this done. And I'll always level with you about the state of affairs.
Thank you.","NOTE: The President spoke at 4:50 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Rep. Charles E. ""Chip"" Roy.

26-Jan-21,Remarks on Racial Justice and Equity and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon, folks. I thank the Vice President for being with me today as well.
In my campaign for President, I made it very clear that the moment had arrived as a Nation where we face deep racial inequities in America and systemic racism that has plagued our Nation for far, far too long.
I said it over the course of the past year that the blinders had been taken come off the Nation of the American people. What many Americans didn't see, or had simply refused to see, couldn't be ignored any longer.
Those 8 minutes and 46 seconds that took George Floyd's life opened the eyes of millions of Americans and millions of people around—all over the world. It was the knee on the neck of justice, and it wouldn't be forgotten. It stirred the conscience and—of tens of millions of Americans, and in my view, it marked a turning point in this country's attitude toward racial justice.
When his 6-year-old daughter Gianna, who I met with when I met with the family—I leaned down to say hi to her, and she said—looked at me, and she said, ""Daddy changed the world."" That's what Gianna said, his daughter. ""Daddy changed the world."" And I believe she is right, not because this kind of injustice stopped—it clearly hasn't—but because the ground has shifted, because it's changed minds and mindsets, because it laid the groundwork for progress.
COVID-19 has further ripped a path of destruction through every community in America—but no one has been spared—but the devastation in communities of color has been nothing short of stunning. Just look at the numbers: 40 percent of frontline workers—nurses, first responders, grocery store workers—are Americans of color, and many are still living on the edge. One in ten Black Americans is out of work today. One in eleven Latino Americans is out of work today. One in seven households in America—about one in four Black, one in five Latino households in America—report that they don't have enough food to eat in the United States of America.
Black and Latino Americans are dying of COVID-19 at rates nearly three times that of White Americans. And it's not White Americans' fault, but it's just a fact. And the Americans now know it, especially younger Americans.
One of the reasons I'm so optimistic about this Nation is that today's generation of young Americans is the most progressive, thoughtful, inclusive generation that America has ever seen. And they are pulling us toward justice in so many ways, forcing us to confront the huge gap in economic—excuse me, economic inequity between those at the top and everyone else, forcing us to confront the existential crisis of climate; and yes, forcing us to confront systemic racism and White supremacy.
It's just been weeks since all of America witnessed a group of thugs, insurrectionists, political extremists, and White supremacists violently attack the Capitol of our democracy. And so now, now is the time to act. It's time to act because that's what the faith and morality calls us to do.
Across nearly every faith, the same principles hold: We're all God's children; we should treat each other as we would like to be treated ourselves. And this is time to act—and this time to act is because it's what the core values of this Nation call us to do. And I believe the vast majority of Americans—Democrats, Republicans, and Independents—share these values and want us to act as well.
We've never fully lived up to the founding principles of this Nation—to state the obvious—that all people are created equal and have a right to be treated equally throughout their lives. And it's time to act now, not only because it's the right thing to do, but because if we do, we'll all be better off for it.
For too long, we've allowed a narrow, cramped view of the promise of this Nation to fester. You know, we've bought the view that America is a zero-sum game in many cases: ""If you succeed, I fail."" ""If you get ahead, I fall behind."" ""If you get the job, I lose mine."" Maybe worst of all, ""If I hold you down, I lift myself up.""
We've lost sight of what President Kennedy told us when he said, ""A rising tide lifts all boats."" And when we lift each other up, we're all lifted up. You know, and the corollary is true as well: When any one of us is held down, we're all held back. More and more economic studies in recent years have proven this, but I don't think you need economic studies to see the truth.
Just imagine if instead of consigning millions of American children to underresourced schools, we gave each and every 3- and 4-year-old child a chance to learn, to go to school—not daycare, to school—and grow and thrive in school and throughout. When they've done that—the places it's been done, it shows they have an exponentially greater chance of going all the way through 12 years of school and doing it well. But you know, does anyone in this whole Nation think we're not all better off if that were to happen?
Just imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans the ability to own a home and build generational wealth—who made it possible for them buy a home, their first home—and begin to build equity to provide for their families and send their children off to school, does anyone doubt that the whole Nation will be better off?
Just imagine: Instead of denying millions of young entrepreneurs the ability to access capital, we made it possible to take their dream to market, create jobs, reinvest in their own communities. Does anyone doubt this whole Nation wouldn't be better off?
Just imagine if more incredibly creative and innovative—how much more creative and innovative we'd be if this Nation held the Historic Black Colleges and Universities to the same opportunities—and minority-serving institutions—that had the same funding and resources of public universities to compete for jobs and industries of the future. You know, just ask the first HBCU graduate elected as Vice President if that's not true.
But to do this, I believe this Nation and this Government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equality—equity. Yes, we need criminal justice reform, but that isn't nearly enough. We need to open the promise of America to every American. And that means we need to make the issue of racial equity not just an issue for any one department of Government; it has to be the business of the whole of Government.
That's why I issued, among the first days, my whole-of-Government Executive order that will, for the first time, advance equity for all throughout our Federal policies and institutions. It focuses on the full range of communities who have been long underserved and overlooked: people of color; Americans with disabilities; LGBTQ Americans; religious minorities; rural, urban, suburban communities facing persistent poverty.
And I've asked Ambassador Susan Rice to lead the administration's charge through the White House and Domestic Policy Council because I know we'll—she'll see it through. Every White House, every White House component, and every agency will be involved in this work because advancing equity has to be everyone's job. Today I'll be shortly signing an additional package of executive actions to continue this vital work. Housing, for example: Housing is a right in America, and homeownership is an essential tool to wealth creation and to be passed down to generations.
Today I'm directing the Department of Housing and urban affairs—and Urban Development to redress historical racism in Federal housing policies. Today I'm directing the Federal agency to reinvigorate the consultation process with Indian Tribes. Respect the Tribal sovereignty—respect for Tribal sovereignty will be a cornerstone of our engaging with Native American communities.
This builds on the work we did last week to expand Tribes' access to the Strategic National Stockpile for the first time, to ensure they receive help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to fight this pandemic.
Today I'm directing Federal agencies to combat resurgence of xenophobia, particularly against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, that we've seen skyrocket during this pandemic. This is unacceptable, and it's un-American. I've asked the Department of Justice to strengthen its partnership with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community to prevent those hate crimes. I've also asked the Department of Health and Human Services to put out best practices for combating xenophobia in our national response to COVID.
Look, in the weeks ahead, I'll be reaffirming the Federal Government's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion and accessibility, building on the work we started in the Obama-Biden administration. That's why I rescinded the previous administration's harmful ban on diversity and sensitivity training and abolished the offensive, counterfactual 1776 Commission. Unity and healing must begin with understanding and truth, not ignorance and lies.
Today I'm also issuing an Executive order that will ultimately end the Justice Department's use of the private prison industry—private prisons, an industry that houses pretrial detainees and Federal prisoners. The Executive order directs the Attorney General to decline to renew contracts with privately operated criminal facilities, a step we started to take at the end of the Obama administration and was reversed under the previous administration.
This is the first step to stop corporations from profiteering off of incarcerating—incarceration that is less humane and less safe, as the studies show. And it is just the beginning of my administration's plan to address systemic problems in our criminal justice system.
Here's another thing that we need to do: We need to restore and expand the Voting Rights Act—named after our dear friend, John Lewis—and continue to fight back against laws that many States are engaged in to suppress the right to vote, while expanding access to the ballot box for all eligible voters.
Because here's the deal, and I'll close with this: I ran for President because I believe we're in a battle for the soul of this Nation. And the simple truth is, our soul will be troubled as long as systemic racism is allowed to persist. We can't eliminate it if—it's not going to be overnight. We can't eliminate everything.
But it's corrosive, it's destructive, and it's costly. It costs every American, not just who have felt the sting of racial injustice. We aren't just less of a—we are not just a nation of morally deprived because of systemic racism; we're also less prosperous, we're less successful, we're less secure.
So we must change, and I know it's going to take time. But I know we can do it. And I firmly believe the Nation is ready to change, but Government has to change as well. We need to make equity and justice part of what we do every day: today, tomorrow, and every day.
Now I'm going to sign these executive actions to continue the work to make real the promise of America for every American. Again, I'm not promising we can end it tomorrow, but I promise you: We're going to continue to make progress to eliminate systemic racism, and every branch of the White House and the Federal Government is going to be part of that effort.
Thank you.
Okay. This first Executive order is a memorandum for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to redress our Nation's and the Federal Government's history of discriminatory housing practices and policies.

Biden, Remarks on Racial Justice and Equity and an Exchange With Reporters Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/347879 ",,,,,,,,,,,
25-Jan-21,Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on Ensuring the Future Is Made in All of America by All of America's Workers and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon, folks. I'm going to make some brief remarks, sign an Executive order, and then take your questions, if that's okay with you all.
Last week, we immediately got to work to contain the pandemic and deliver economic relief to millions of Americans who need it the most. And today we're getting to work to rebuild the backbone of America: manufacturing, unions, and the middle class.
It's based on a simple premise: that we'll reward work, not wealth, in this country. And the key plank of ensuring the future will be ""Made in America."" I've long said that I don't accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization can't keep—can keep union jobs from growing here in America. We can create more of them, not fewer of them.
I don't buy for 1 second the—that the vitality of the American manufacturing is a thing of the past. American manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in World War II, and it must be part of the engine of American prosperity now. That means we are going to use taxpayers' money to rebuild America. We'll buy American products and support American jobs, union jobs.
For example, the Federal Government every year spends approximately $600 billion in Government procurement to keep the country going safe and secure. And there's a law that's been on the books for almost a century now: to make sure that that money was spent—taxpayers' dollars for procurement is spent to support American jobs and American businesses.
But the previous administration didn't take it seriously enough. Federal agencies waived the ""Buy American"" requirement without much pushback at all. Big corporations and special interests have long fought for loopholes to redirect American taxpayers' dollars to foreign companies for the products being made. The result: tens of billions of American taxpayers' dollars supporting foreign jobs and foreign industries.
In 1918—excuse me, in 2018 alone, the Department spent $3 billion—the Defense Department—on foreign construction contracts, leaving American steel and iron out in the cold. It spent nearly $300 million in foreign engines and on vehicles instead of buying American vehicles and engines from American companies, putting Americans to work. Under the previous administration, the Federal Government contract awarded directly to foreign companies went up 30 percent. That is going to change on our watch.
Today I'm taking the first steps in my larger Build Back Better Recovery Plan that invests in American workers, unions, and businesses up and down the supply chain. And I know that previous Presidents entered office by promising to buy America and instituting the ""Buy American"" policy, but here's why this is different and not the same:
I'll be signing an Executive order in just a moment, tightening the existing ""Buy American"" policies, and go further. We're setting clear directives and clear explanations. We're going to get to the core issue with a centralized, coordinated effort.
Look, today I'm creating a Director of Made in America at the White House Office of Management and Budget who will oversee our all-of-Government ""Made in America"" initiative. That starts with stopping Federal agencies from waiving buy-in-America—""Buy American"" requirements with impunity, as has been going on. If an agency wants to issue a waiver to say ""We're not going to buy an American product as part of this project; we're going to buy a foreign product,"" they have to come to the White House and explain it to us.
We're going to require that waivers be publicly posted; that is, if someone is seeking a waiver to build this particular vehicle or facility and is going to buy the following foreign parts, that waiver—the request for it—is going to be posted. Then, we'll work with small American manufacturers and businesses to give them a shot to raise their hand and say, ""Yes, I can do that here in my shop, in my town.""
It's about—as you've heard me say before, I used to have a friend who was a great athlete, who'd say, ""You've got to know how to know."" These small businesses don't even know they can compete for making the product that is attempting to be waived and being able to be bought abroad.
And I'm directing the Office of Management and Budget to review waivers to make sure they are only used in very limited circumstances. For example, when there's an overwhelming national security, humanitarian, or emergency need here in America. This hasn't happened before. It will happen now.
Here's what else we're going to be doing. Under the Build Back Better Recovery Plan, we'll invest hundreds of billions of dollars in buying American products and materials to modernize our infrastructure, and our competitive strength will increase in a competitive world. That means millions of good-paying jobs, using American-made steel and technology, to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our ports, and to make them more climate resilient, as well as make them able to move faster and cheaper and cleaner to transport American-made goods across the country and around the world, making us more competitive.
It also means replenishing our stockpiles to enhance our national security. As this pandemic has made clear, we can never again be in a position where we have to rely on a foreign country that doesn't share our interest in order to protect our people during a national emergency. We need to make our own protective equipment, essential products and supplies. And we'll work with our allies to make sure they have resilient supply chains as well.
We'll also make historic investments in research and development—hundreds of billions of dollars—to sharpen America's innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs, markets like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, clean energy.
The Federal Government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we're going to replace with clean, electric vehicles made right here in America by American workers, creating millions of jobs—a million autoworker jobs in clean energy—and vehicles that are net-zero emissions.
And together, this will be the largest mobilization of public investment in procurement, infrastructure, and R&D since World War II.
And with the Executive order I'll be signing today, we'll increase ""Buy American"" requirements for these kinds of projects and improve the way we measure domestic content requirements. For example, right now, if you manufacture a vehicle for the Federal Government, you need to show that at least 50 percent of the components of that vehicle were made in America. But because of loopholes that have been expanded over time, you can count the least valuable possible parts as part of that 50 percent to say ""Made in America,"" while the most valuable parts—the engines, the steel, the glass—are manufactured abroad.
So basically—but basically, we're batting zero for two. The content threshold of 50 percent aren't high enough. And the way we measure the content doesn't account for U.S. jobs and economic activity. We're going to change that as well. The executive action I'm signing today will not only require that companies make more of their components in America, but that the value of those components is contributing to our economy, measured by things like a number of American jobs created and/or supported.
At the same time, we'll be committed to working with our trading partners to modernize international trade rules, including those relating to Government procurement, to make sure we can use—we can all use our taxpayer dollars to spur investment that promotes growth and resilient supply chains.
And here's what else the action does. When we buy America, we'll buy from all of America. That includes communities that have historically been left out of Government procurement: Black, Brown, Native American small businesses and entrepreneurs in every region of the country. We will use a national network of manufacturers called a Manufacturing Extension Partnership, that's in all 50 States and Puerto Rico, to help Government agency connect with new domestic suppliers across the country.
This is a critical piece of building our economy back better and including everyone in the deal this time, especially small businesses that are badly hurting in this economy.
The Executive Action I am taking also reiterates my strong support for the Jones Act and American vessels, you know, and our ports, especially those important for America's clean energy future and the development of offshore renewable energy.
I'll close with this: The reason we need to do this is, America can't sit on the sidelines in the race for the future.
Our competitors aren't waiting. To ensure the future is made in America, we need to win not just the jobs of today, but the jobs and industries of tomorrow. And we know that the middle class built this country, and we also know unions built the middle class. So let's invest in them once again. I know we're ready, despite all of the—all we're facing. I have never been more optimistic about the future of America than I am today.
Given even just half a chance, the American people, the American worker, has never, ever let the country down. Imagine if we give them a full chance. That's what we're going to do.
I'll stop here and sign the Executive order and then come back and take some of your questions.
This Executive order is entitled ""Ensuring the Future Is Made in America, by Americans—All of American Workers.""
[At this point, the President signed the Executive order.]
There you go. Now I'd now be happy to take your questions.
White House Director of Message Planning Meghan Hays. [Inaudible]—from AP.
School Reopening Efforts/Reopening Businesses 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Jonathan Lemire with the Associated Press. Two topics, if I may. The first: You have made reopening schools a central part of your first hundred days' agenda, and you've long portrayed yourself as an ally to the teachers and the unions. Right now the Chicago Teachers Union has refused. They defied an order to return to in-person classing—for in-person classrooms because of a lack of vaccinations. Do you believe, sir, that teachers should return to schools now?
The President. I believe we should make school classrooms safe and secure for the students, for the teachers, and for the help that's in those schools maintaining the facilities. We need new ventilation systems in those schools. We need testing for people coming in and out of the classes. And we need testing for teachers, as well as students. And we need the capacity: the capacity to know that, in fact, the circumstance in the school is safe and secure for everyone.
For example, there is no reason why—the clear guidance will be that every school should be thoroughly sanitized, from the lavatories to the hallways. And so this is about making—and none of the school districts that I'm aware of—there may be some, of public school districts—have insisted that all of those pieces be in place.
And, I might add, it's the same kind of thing I hope we can do with small businesses and businesses, making sure they have the capacity to test their workers when they come in; to make sure they have plastic dividers in between their booths in their restaurants, et cetera; to make sure they can sanitize.
So it's not so much about the idea that teachers aren't going to work. The teachers I know, they want to work. They just want to work in a safe environment and as safe as we can rationally make it. And we can do that, and we should be able to open up every school, kindergarten through eighth grade, if, in fact, we administer these tests.
And it will have the added advantage, I might add, of putting millions of people back to work, all those mothers and fathers that are home taking care of their children, rather than go to work. Even when they can work, they're not able to do it unless they have the luxury of working distance-wise, like many of us do. They're not able to do it. And so this is about generating economic growth overall as well.
Director Hays. Great. Alex from Reuters.
Russia-U.S. Relations 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm Alex Alper from Reuters. I wanted to ask a question about Navalny—if you are considering imposing sanctions on any of the individuals involved in his attempted poisoning and/or his arrest when he returned from Germany. And if not, is that related to your concerns about it potentially derailing a New START extension? Thank you.
The President. I find that we can both operate in the mutual self-interest of our countries as a New START agreement and make it clear to Russia that we are very concerned about their behavior, whether it's Navalny, whether it's the SolarWinds, or whether it's the reports of bounties on the heads of Americans in Afghanistan.
I have asked the agencies in question to do a thorough read for me on every one of those issues, to update me on precisely where they are. And I will not hesitate to raise those issues with the Russians.
Director Hays. Geoff [Geoff Bennett, NBC News] from NBC.
Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation 
Q. President Biden, Vice President Harris, a question about your COVID relief deal. On Friday, you said the Nation is ""in a national emergency [and] we should act like it."" Given that—given the scale and the severity of the need, how long are you willing to get sufficient Republican support before you would greenlight Democrat attempts to use reconciliation, for instance, to pass that bill?
The President. Well, look, the decision on reconciliation will be one made by the leaders of the House and the Senate. But here's the deal: I have been doing legislative negotiations for a large part of my life. I know how the system works. And what I'm not—I can't guarantee anything at all, but I can say that what I'm going to be doing—and we've already begun—is making it clear to the leadership in the House and the Senate, as well as the—the group of 16—it's a group, a bipartisan group, as well as Republican individuals who have an interest in the issues that are in that—my package, and saying ""Here's what I'm doing, and here's why I want to do it, here's why I think we need to do it, and what kind of support can or can't you give to that?"" And then, we go on to the way in which we deal with legislation all the time.
You know, we didn't have any votes for the recovery package when Barack and I came into office. We were short three votes. We didn't know we had the votes until the day of the—bringing it up.
And—but here's the deal: You know, it's interesting—and I know you ask a lot of these questions. You know the answers, but you have to, to help educate the public as well; I'm not suggesting you don't know what I'm about to say. No one wants to give up on their position until there's no other alternative. They either have to make a decision that they don't do what—they don't support what is being proposed, or they insist on what they have, or they let it all go away, fall down. I think we're far from that point right now.
The decision to use reconciliation will depend upon how these negotiations go. And let me make clear about negotiations: I've always believed part of negotiation—on the part of a President and/or of a chairman of a committee trying to get a major piece of legislation passed—is about consultation.
It's not enough for me just to come up to you and say: ""I like this. I expect you to support it."" I want to explain to you why I think it's so important in this package that we have to provide for money for additional vaccines, why I think it's so important why we provide for money to extend unemployment benefits, why I think it's so important that we provide money to provide for the ability of people not to be thrown out of their apartments during this pandemic because they can't afford their rent, and to make the case to you why I think and what I think the priorities within this piece—that we think the priorities are—I apologize—were within this legislation.
And I don't expect we'll know whether we have an agreement or to what extent the entire package will be able to pass or not pass until we get right down to the very end of this process, which will be probably in a couple of weeks. But the point is, this is just the process beginning.
Director Hays. Annie, the Washington Post.
Q. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. President, Annie Linskey with the Washington Post.
The President. Hi, Annie.
Political Unity/The President's Agenda 
Q. I wanted to ask you a little bit about one of the, sort of, major themes of your campaign, and how you sort of intend to measure and enact it—and that is the idea of unity. If you could talk a little bit about what you see unity as being? There are some people who are defining it as being bipartisan. Others are saying it is what most of the people in the country, defined by some poll, might believe, or any sort of number of other—or perhaps it's 50 plus 1, or 50 plus 2, or 75 percent.
So, given that it is such a key part of your message and your promise, can you talk and reflect a little bit more about what is unity when you see it and as you define it?
The President. Well, Annie, I think it makes up several of the issues—the points you made. One is: Unity requires you to take away—eliminate the vitriol, make anything that you disagree with about the other person's personality or their lack of integrity or they're not decent legislators and the like—so we have to get rid of that. And I think that's already beginning to change, but God knows where things go, number one. Unity also is: trying to reflect what the majority of the American people—Democrat, Republican, and Independent—think is within the fulcrum of what needs to be done to make their lives and the lives of Americans better. For example, if you look at the data—and I'm not claiming the polling data to be exact, but if you look at the data, you have—I think it's—I hope I'm saying this correct—you may correct me if I get the number wrong, I think it's 57, 58 percent of the American people—including Republicans, Democrats, and Independents—think that we have to do something about the COVID vaccine; we have to do something about making sure that people who are being—hurting badly, can't eat, don't have food, are in a position where they're about to be thrown out of their apartments, et cetera, being able to have an opportunity to get a job—that they all think we should be acting, we should be doing more.
Unity also is trying to get, at a minimum—if you pass a piece of legislation that breaks down on party lines but it gets passed, it doesn't mean there wasn't unity; it just means it wasn't bipartisan. I'd prefer these things to be bipartisan, because I'm trying to generate some consensus and take sort of the—how can I say it?—the vitriol out of all of this. Because I'm confident—I'm confident—from my discussions, there are a number of Republicans who know we have to do something about the food insecurity for people in this pandemic. I'm confident they know we have to do something about figuring out how to get children back in school.
There's just—there's easy ways to deal with this. One, if you're anti-union, you can say it's all because of teachers. If you want to make a case though that it's complicated, you say, ""Well, what do you have to do to make it safe to get in those schools?"" Now, we're going to have arguments.
For example, you know I proposed that we—because it was bipartisan, I thought it would increase the prospects of passage—the additional $1,400 in direct cash payment to folks. Well, there's legitimate reason for people to say, ""Do you have the lines drawn the exact right way? Should it go to anybody making over x number of dollars or y?"" I'm open to negotiate those things. That's all.
I picked it because I thought it was rational, reasonable, and it had overwhelming bipartisan support in the House when it passed. But this is all a bit of a moving target in terms of the precision with which this goes. You're asking about unity: 51 votes, bipartisan, et cetera.
The other piece of this is that the one thing that gives me hope that we're not only going to, sort of, stay away from the ad hominem attacks on one another, is that there is an overwhelming consensus among the major economists at home and in the world that the way to avoid a deeper, deeper, deeper recession, moving in the direction of losing our competitive capacity, is to spend money now to—from—across the board, every major institution has said, ""If we don't invest now, we're going to lose so much altitude, in terms of our employment base and our economic growth, it's going to be harder to reestablish it."" We can afford to do it now. As a matter of fact, the—I think the response has been: ""We can't afford not to invest now. We can't afford to fail to invest now.""
And I think there's a growing realization of that on the part of all but some very, very hard-edged partisans, maybe on both sides, but I think there is a growing consensus. Whether we get it all done exactly the way I want it remains to be seen, but I'm confident that we can work our way through.
We have to work our way through because, as I've said 100 times, there is no ability in a democracy for it to function without the ability to reach consensus. Other- —otherwise it just becomes executive fiat or battleground issues that are—get us virtually nowhere.
I don't want to hold the—my colleague may know, the Vice President—but you know, I think there were very few debates on the Senate floor the whole last year—— Vice President Kamala D. Harris. That's correct.
The President. ——on almost any issue.
Well, that benefits no one. It doesn't inform anybody. It doesn't allow the public to make judgments about who they think is right or wrong.
So I am optimistic that it may take some time, but over the year, the way—if we treat each other with respect—and we're going to argue like hell. [Laughter] I'm confident of that. Believe me, I know that. I've been there. But I think we can do it in a way that we can get things done for the American people.
Director Hays. Great. Last question. Josh [Josh Wingrove] from Bloomberg.
Q. Thank you.
The President. Josh, they don't trust you with the mike, huh? I don't know, man.
Economic Stimulus Legislation/Coronavirus Vaccine Deployment 
Q. No, that's fine. I wouldn't either. [Laughter] Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate you taking the questions.
You mentioned just now that you might know in a couple of weeks. Can I ask whether it's more important for you to get something passed in a short timeframe like that or would you be willing to wait longer to get more bipartisan support?
And might I also ask that—one of the pillars is the vaccine funding—when do you think any American who wants to get the shot will be able to get the shot?
The President. Well, I'll try to answer the three parts to your question as I heard them.
One, time is of the essence. Time is of the essence. And I must tell you, I'm reluctant to cherry pick and take out one or two items here and then have to go through it again to—because these all are kind of—they go, sort of, hand in glove, each of these issues. Number one.
Number two, we are optimistic that we will have enough vaccine and in very short order. We, as you know, we came in office without knowledge of how much vaccine was held—being held in abeyance or available. Now that we're here—we've been around a week or so—we now have that. And we've gotten commitments from some of the producers that they will, in fact, produce more vaccine in a relatively short period of time and then continue that down the road.
So I'm quite confident that we will be in a position, within the next 3 weeks or so, to be vaccinating people at the range of a million a day or in excess of that. That is my—I promised that we would get at least a hundred million vaccinations—that's not people, because sometimes you need more than one shot of the vaccination. But 100,000—a hundred million shots in people's arms of the vaccine.
I think, with the grace of God, and the good will of the neighbor, and the creek not rising, as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to get that to 150—1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day. But we have to meet that goal of a million a day.
And everything points that we're going to have: A, the—enough vaccine; B, enough syringes and all the paraphernalia needed to store, keep, inject, move into your arm the vaccine; three, a number of vaccinators, people administering the vaccine, which is not an easy task of those who have—those facilities, like the nursing homes and hospitals—they have people do it, but they don't have the capacity to do everyone. And so I think we're going to have—we're leaning hard on—into areas where we can produce more vaccinators. We feel confident we can do that. And thirdly, it's really important that we have the fora, the place, the facility, the circumstance where people can show up, stand in line, and get their vaccine without having to stand in line for 8 hours—being able to pick up the phone, call the pharmacy, and get your name on the list, et cetera.
All those mechanical things are really—they sound simple, but they're all consequential when we're trying to get out a minimum of 100 million vaccinations in 100 days and move in the direction where we are well beyond that in the next 100 days so we can get to the point where we reach herd immunity in a country of over 300 million people. Does that answer your question?
Q. Well, my question was at what date—or, roughly, when do you think anyone who wants one would be able to get it? Is it summer? Is it fall?
The President. Oh, I—no, I think it will be this spring. I think we'll be able to do that this spring. And—but it's going to be a logistical challenge that exceeds anything we've ever tried in this country, but I think we can do that.
I feel confident that, by summer, we're going to be well on our way to heading toward herd immunity and increasing the access for people who aren't on the first—aren't on the list, all the way going down to children and how we deal with that.
But I feel good about where we're going, and I think we can get it done.
Director Hays. Thank you, guys.
Q. One more. One more on vaccines. Mr. President, one more on vaccines.
The President. Now, wait, wait, wait. I know he always asks me tough questions—[laughter]—and he always has an edge to them, but I like him anyway. So go ahead and answer—ask the question.
Coronavirus Vaccine Deployment/Coronavirus Response Efforts 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. So you just said that you think within 3 weeks or so we'll be at the point where there are a million vaccines per day, but it seems like—
The President. No, I think we'll get there before that. I said, ""I hope""—I misspoke. I hope we'll be able to increase as we go on until we get to the million-five a day. That's my hope.
Q. And then, my—the follow-up to that would be: Now that you're President and you're saying, ""There is nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months,"" what happened to 2 months ago when you were talking declaratively about ""I'm going to shut down the virus""?
The President. Well, I'm going to shut down the virus, but not—I never said I'd do it in 2 months. I said it took a long time to get here; it's going take a long time to beat it. And so we have millions of people out there who are—who have the virus.
We're just, for the first day, I think—correct me if I'm wrong; I've been doing other things this morning, speaking with foreign leaders. But one of the things—I think this is one of the first days that the number has actually come down—the number of deaths—and the number on a daily basis, and the number of hospitalizations, et cetera.
It's going to take time. It's going to take a heck of a lot of time. And we still have—as Dr. Fauci constantly points out, it's one thing when we have mass—how can I say it politely?—mass disregard of the warnings about not wearing masks and wearing masks and social distancing and failure to social distance and people getting together on holidays in ways that weren't recommended, et cetera. We see—the first thing that happens is, we see the number of infections go up. Then, you see the hospitalizations go up. Then, you see the deaths go up. And so we're in this for a while. I mean, we're—what are we now? At about 410,000 deaths. And there's going to be more. The prediction, as I said from the very beginning to getting here as—after being sworn in, was—the predictions were: We're going to see somewhere between a total of 600,000 and 660,000 deaths before we begin to turn the corner in a major way.
So—and again, remember: The vaccine—most of the people taking the vaccine—a vast, significant number—required two shots, and they're an average of 3 weeks apart. And it takes time for it to be sure that you're—you get to that 95-percent assurance rate.
And so it's beginning to move. But I'm confident we will beat this. We will beat this. But we're still going to be talking about this in the summer. We're still going to be dealing with this issue in the early fall.
And last point I'll make—and I know you're tired of hearing me saying it, particularly—you may be tired of me saying it. [Laughter] And that is that if we wear masks between now and the end of April, the experts tell us we can save 50,000 lives—50,000 people—who otherwise would die.

I'm about to sign an Executive order, but I want to begin by thanking the Vice President for helping this, but also thank Chairman Milley, who has been a great, great help, and then also the soon-to-be Secretary of Defense, who, when we can finish this, will be sworn in in a moment.

But all kidding aside, this is reinstating a position that previous commanders and—as well as the Secretaries have supported.

22-Jan-21,Remarks on Signing Executive Orders on Economic Relief Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Protecting the Federal Workforce and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon, folks. Vice President Harris and I just received a briefing from our economic team, and we remain in a once-in-a-century public health crisis that's led to the most unequal job and economic crisis in modern history. And the crisis is only deepening. It's not getting better; it's deepening.
Yesterday we learned that 900,000 more Americans filed for unemployment—900,000. They join millions of Americans who, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. So many of them never thought they'd ever be out of work in the first place. And just like my dad did when he was—he used to lie awake at night when I was a kid, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep because he worried about whether or not he's about to lose his health care, or whether we were going to be—or have the money to pay the mortgage because of the economic circumstance he was in.
And now, a lot of these folks are facing eviction or waiting hours in their cars—literally hours in their cars, waiting to be able to feed their children as they drive up to a food bank. It's the United States of America, and they're waiting to feed their kids.
Folks who are able to still keep their job, many have seen their paychecks reduced, and they've—and they're barely hanging on and wondering what's next. Sometimes, the anxiety about what's going to happen next is more consequential than what actually happened.
But this is happening today, in America, and this cannot be who we are as a country. These are not the values of our Nation. We cannot, will not let people go hungry. We cannot let people be evicted because of nothing they did themselves. They cannot watch people lose their jobs. And we have to act. We have to act now.
It's not just to meet the moral obligation to treat our fellow Americans with the dignity and respect they deserve; this is an economic imperative. A growing economic consensus that we must act decisively and boldly to grow the economy for all Americans, not just for tomorrow, but in the future.
There's a growing chorus of top economic—top economists that agree that in this moment of crisis, with this—with the interest rates as low as they are—historic lows—it is smart fiscal investment, including deficit spending. And they're more urgent than ever.
You know, and that return on these investments and jobs and racial equity is going to prevent long-term economic damage and benefits that are going to far surpass the cost. If we don't act, the rest of the world is not standing still, in terms of the competitive advantage and the competitive possibilities, relative to us.
That our debt situation will be more stable and not less stable, according to these economists. And that such investments in our people is going to strengthen our economic competitiveness as a Nation and help us outcompete our competitors in the global economy, because we're going to grow the economy with these investments.
While the COVID-19 package that passed in December was a first step, as I said at the time, it's just a downpayment. We need more action, and we need to move fast. Last week, I laid out a two-step plan of rescue and recovery to get through the crisis and to a better and stronger and more secure America. The first step of our American Rescue Plan is a plan to tackle the pandemic and get direct financial relief to Americans who need it the most.
You know, in just a few days—it's just been a few days since I outlined this plan—it's received bipartisan support from a majority of American mayors and Governors. Businesses and labor organizations have together welcomed it as an urgent action that's needed. Even Wall Street firms have underscored its importance.
In fact, an analysis by Moody's estimates that if we passed our American Rescue Plan, the economy would create 7.5 million jobs just in this year alone. That would be on the way to the more than 18 million—I think it was 18,600,000—jobs that they believe would be created over the 4-year period, with our Build Back Better Recovery Plan.
And with our American Rescue Plan, our economy would return to full employment a full year faster than without the plan.
Even President Trump's—President Trump's now—not some liberal organization—President Trump's top former economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said, quote, he ""absolutely is in favor"" of this rescue plan. This almost doesn't have a partisan piece to it.
We're seeing the support because this plan takes a step that we so urgently need. More than just a step, a number of steps. It funds big parts of the COVID-19 National Strategy that I released yesterday—we released yesterday. Our national strategy puts on—us on a war footing to aggressively speed up our COVID-19 response, especially on vaccines and testing and reopening our schools.
I found it fascinating—yesterday the press asked the question: Is, you know, a hundred million enough? A week before, they were saying: ""Biden, are you crazy? You can't do hundred million in a hundred days."" Well, we're going to, God willing, not only do a hundred million, we're going to do more than that. But this is—we have to do this. We have to move.
The American Rescue Plan also includes economic relief for most Americans who are in need. We're going to finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in direct payments to folks. Six hundred dollars, which was already passed, is simply not enough if you still have to choose between paying your rent and putting food on the table.
We'll extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of workers, beyond the deadline that's now set. It means that 16 million Americans who are currently relying on unemployment benefits while they look for work can count on these checks continuing to be there in the middle of this crisis.
The American Rescue Plan also addresses the growing housing crisis in America. Approximately 14 million Americans—14 million—have fallen behind on rent, and many risk eviction. If we fail to act, there will be a wave of evictions and foreclosures in the coming months as this pandemic rages on, because there's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months.
So look, this would overwhelm emergency shelters and increase COVID-19 infections as people have nowhere to go and are socially—can't socially distance.
The American Rescue Plan asks Congress to provide rental assistance for millions of hard-hit families and tenants. This will also be a bridge to economic recovery for countless mom-and-pop landlords who can't afford not to have the rent.
But they can't wait. So, on Inauguration day, I directed my administration to extend nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures. These crises are straining the budgets of States and cities and in Tribal communities that are forced to consider layoffs and service reductions among essential workers. Police officers, firefighters, first responders, nurses, they're all at the risk of losing their jobs. Over the last year, more than 600,000 educators have lost their jobs in the cities and towns. The American Rescue Plan will provide emergency funding to keep these essential workers on the job and maintain essential services.
Look, it will also help small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth. When you say ""small business,"" most people think the major corporate entities are the ones that hire everybody. These small businesses are the glue that hold—and they're important—but these small businesses hold the community—are the glue that hold these communities together. They are hurting badly, and they account for nearly half of the entire U.S. workforce. Nearly half.
Our rescue plan will provide flexible grants to help the hardest hit small businesses survive the pandemic and low-cost capital to help entrepreneurs of all backgrounds create and maintain jobs, plus provide essential goods and services that communities so desperately depend on.
Look, our recovery plan also calls for an increase in the minimum wage, at 15—at least $15 an hour. No one in America should work 40 hours a week making below the poverty line. Fifteen dollars gets people above the poverty line. And we have so many millions of people working 40 hours a week—working—and some with two jobs, and they're still below the poverty line.
Our plan includes access to affordable childcare that's going to enable parents, particularly women, to get back to work, millions who are not working now because they don't have that care.
All told, the American Rescue Plan would lift 12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half. That's 5 million children lifted out of poverty. Our plan would reduce poverty in the Black community by one-third and reduce poverty in the Hispanic community by almost 40 percent.
I look forward to working with Members of Congress of both parties to move quickly to get this American Rescue Plan to the American people. And then, we can move with equal urgency and bipartisanship to the second step of our economic plan, the Build Back Better, the recovery plan.
It's a plan that will make historic investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy, and so much more that's going to create millions more jobs—good-paying jobs, not minimum wage jobs.
But while we work with Members of both parties in the Congress, there are steps that we can and must take right now. For example, on Inauguration day, I directed my administration to pause student loan repayments for interest for—the interest payments for Americans with Federal student loans until at least September, so they're not going to have to pay until September. They still pay the bill, as it stands now, but they will not accrue interest, and they don't have to pay—begin to pay until September. And we may have to look beyond that, I might add.
Today I'm signing an Executive order that directs the whole-of-Government—a whole-of-Government effort to help millions of Americans who are badly hurting. It requires all Federal agencies to do what they can do to provide relief to families, small businesses, and communities. And in the days ahead, I expect agencies to act.
Let me touch on two ways these actions can help change Americans lives. We need to tackle the growing hunger crisis in America. One in seven households in America—one in seven—more than one in five Black and Latino households in America report they do not have enough food to eat. That includes nearly 30 million adults and as many as 12 million children. And again, they're in this situation through no fault of their own. It's unconscionable. The American Rescue Plan provides additional emergency food and nutrition assistance for tens of millions of children and families to address this crisis. But families literally can't wait another day. As a result of the Executive order I'm going to shortly sign, the Department of Agriculture will consider taking immediate steps to make it easier for the hardest hit families to enroll and claim more generous benefits in the critical food and nutrition assistance area.
This is going to help tens of millions of families, especially those who can't provide meals for their kids, who are learning remotely at home, are not receiving the regular meal plans that they have at school for breakfast or lunch. It's going to also—and we also need to protect the health and safety of the American worker.
Right now approximately 40 percent of households in America have at least one member with a preexisting condition. Just imagine: You're out of work through no fault of your own. You file for unemployment while you're looking for a job. You find one, and you get an offer. But then, you find out there's a high risk of your getting infected with COVID-19 because of your condition. You and your loved one—and you and your loved ones have ever even greater risk of death and serious illness because of the preexisting conditions, so you turn it down.
Right now, if you did that, you could be denied unemployment insurance because you're offered a job and you didn't take it. It's wrong. No one should have to choose between their livelihoods and their own health or the health of their loved ones in the middle of a deadly pandemic.
Because of the Executive order I'm about to sign, I expect the Department of Labor to guarantee the right to refuse unemployment—the employment that will jeopardize your health, and if you do so, you'll still be able to qualify for the insurance. That's a judgment the Labor Department will make.
Look, there are just two consequential ways that the action I'm taking today will help people in need. Another way to help approximately 2 million veterans maintain their financial footing: by pausing Federal collections on overpayments and debts.
Another makes sure that Federal contractors are receiving taxpayers' dollars, provide their workers with the pay and benefits they deserve. These are places where Federal tax dollars are administered—are being made available to build things from ships to staircases. And we let out—the Federal Government lets the contract—and we're going to make sure that they buy American and are made in America.
And here's another: Right now there are up to 8 million people that are eligible for direct payments from the CARES Act and the relief bill passed in December. They're entitled to those payments, but there's not an easy way for those folks to assess—access them. So we're making it a priority today to fix that problem and get them relief they're entitled to.
Look, I'm going to close and summarize this way: A lot of America is hurting. The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000. Families are going hungry. People are at risk of being evicted. Job losses are mounting again. We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act.
If—if we act now, our economy will be stronger in both the short and long run. That's what economists—left, right, and center—are telling us, both liberal and conservative. We'll be better and stronger across the board. If we act now, we'll be better able to compete with the world. If we act now, we'll be better able to meet our moral obligations to one another as Americans.
I don't believe the people of this country just want to stand by and watch their friends and their neighbors, coworkers, fellow Americans go hungry, lose their homes, or lose their sense of dignity and hope and respect—I don't believe that—especially in the middle of a pandemic that's so weakened and wreaked so much havoc and caused so much pain on America. That's not who we are.
The bottom line is this: We're in a national emergency, and we need to act like we're in a national emergency. So we've got to move with everything we've got, and we've got to do it together. I don't believe Democrats or Republicans are going hungry and losing jobs; I believe Americans are going hungry and losing their jobs.
And we have the tools to fix it. We have the tools to get through this. We have the tools to get this virus under control and our economy back on track. And we have the tools to help people. So let's use the tools, all of them. Use them now.
So I'm going to sign this Executive order, but let me conclude again by saying: Folks, this is one of the cases where business, labor, Wall Street, Main Street, liberal, conservative, economists know we have to act now, not only to help who are in need now, but to allow us to be in the competitive position worldwide and be the leader of the world economy in the next year, and two, and three, and going forward.
So thank you. I'm going to sign this Executive order.
The first one is the economic relief related to COVID-19 pandemic.
[At this point, the President signed the Executive order titled ""Economic Relief Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic.""]
The second one is protection—protecting the Federal workforce.
[The President signed the Executive order titled ""Protecting the Federal Workforce.""]
Thank you very much. 
Senate Trial Concerning the Impeachment of Former President Donald J. Trump 
Q. Mr. President, do you support Mitch McConnell's timeline for a February impeachment trial?
The President. I haven't heard the detail of it, but I do think that having some time to get our administration up and running, we—they—I want to thank the Senate for passing our Secretary of Defense. It looks like our Secretary of Treasury, it looks like our Secretary of State is in place. So the more time we have to get up and running and meet these crises, the better.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/347843 ",,,,,,,,,,,
21-Jan-21,Remarks Announcing the National Strategy on COVID-19 and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Hey, Doctor, how are you?
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci. Mr. President, how are you?
The President. You're going to be doing a lot of talking to me, that's why.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Dr. Fauci, nice to see you.
Director Fauci. Nice to see you.
The President. Good afternoon. Before I begin with today's announcement, let me take a few moments to thank all the law enforcement folks for all they did, the military personnel, from all across the Federal, State, and local agencies that secured yesterday's Inaugural activities. And a special thanks to the members of the National Guard from around the country. It was an unprecedented situation; hopefully, it will never have to be renewed again. And everyone handled it with the most professionalism and duty and honor that could be expected. The President—as President, as Commander in Chief, I always respect and revere their service and that of their families.
But now, to today's announcement: Vice President Harris and I were joined by members of our COVID-19 team—response team—and Dr. Tony Fauci, our chief COVID medical adviser; Xavier Becerra—excuse me—our nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services; Dr. Vivek Murthy, our nominee for Surgeon General; Dr. Rochelle Walensky—she's going to be the Director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, who will be leading our equity work in the COVID response; and Jeff Zients and Natalie Quillian, who are managing this whole effort.
Yesterday, during my Inaugural Address, I offered a salient prayer and a silent prayer—it was both salient and silent. I thought it was important that people understand what had happened, that we all pay tribute to the—our prayers for those 400,000 Americans who have lost their lives in this pandemic.
On Tuesday, Jill and I, and Kamala and Doug, we stood at the Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial and joined Americans all across the country to remember those 400,000 moms and dads, husbands and wives, children—sons, daughters. And I said at that moment that to heal, we must remember. To heal, we must remember. It's important to do that as a Nation. But we must also act, though, not just remember.
Yet, for the past year, we couldn't rely on the Federal Government to act with the urgency and focus and coordination we needed. And we have seen the tragic cost of that failure: 3,000 to 4,000 deaths per day. To date, more than 24 million Americans—24 million Americans—have been infected. To put that in context, America makes up 4 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of the world's confirmed COVID-19 cases and nearly 20 percent of all the COVID-19 deaths, when we have 4 percent of the world's population.
The pandemically—the pandemic, excuse me, has disproportionately impacted on Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans, who are about four times as likely to be hospitalized and nearly three times more likely to die from the COVID-19 pandemic than White Americans. Hospitals are out of beds. Businesses are closed for good. Schools are caught in between. And while the vaccines provide so much hope, the rollout has been a dismal failure thus far.
So I understand the despair and frustration of so many Americans and how they're feeling. I understand why many Governors, mayors, county officials, Tribal leaders feel like they're left on their own without a clear national plan to get them through the crisis.
Let me be very clear: Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better. The memorial we held 2 nights ago will not be our last one, unfortunately. The death toll will likely top 500,000 next month, and the cases will continue to mount. We didn't get into this mess overnight, and it's going to take months for us to turn things around.
But let me be equally clear: We will get through this. We will defeat this pandemic. And to a nation waiting for action, let me be the clearest on this point: Help is on the way.
Today—today—I am unveiling a national strategy on COVID-19 and executive actions to beat this pandemic. This plan reflects the ideas I set forward during the campaign and further refined over the past 3 months. It consists of my transitions teams, the Task Force, Tony Fauci and the team here today, and other experts, who put this plan together.
Our national strategy is comprehensive. It's based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial. And it's detailed. You can review this entire plan—this entire plan—by going to whitehouse.gov. It is so detailed. It is over a hundred—it's 198 pages, and it's complete detail on what we're going to do.
Our plan starts with mounting an aggressive, safe, and effective vaccination campaign to meet our goal of administering 100 million shots in our first hundred days in office. We're on day one. This will be one of the greatest operational challenges our Nation has ever undertaken, and I'm committed to getting it done. We're committed to getting it done.
And I explained—as I explained last week, we'll move Heaven and Earth to get more people vaccinated for free and create more places for them to get vaccinated, to mobilize more medical teams to get shots in people's arms, and to increase vaccine supply and get it out the door as fast as possible.
Yesterday we got started. We directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency—FEMA—to start standing up the first federally supported community vaccination centers, with the goal of standing up 100 centers within the next month. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will launch the Federal pharmacy program to make vaccines available to communities and their local pharmacies beginning early—within—I think by the 7th or 8th of February, but in very early February.
We'll also task the Department of Health and Human Services to prepare and expand the pool of medical professionals who can administer the vaccine—who can administer the vaccine—and to ensure we have enough vaccinators—the people doing the vaccines—to meet the Nation's needs and quickly.
In addition to this effort, our administration will be asking Congress to fund—for the funds to grow the public health workforce. We also are going to take immediate steps to partner with Governors, mayors, and other local officials, who we've been talking to all along, who are on the frontlines of this fight.
We directed FEMA to establish a COVID response liaison for each State, which means every State will have a point person at the Federal level to maximize cooperation between the Federal Government and the States. And where it falls short, to be made known about it—to be made known immediately. This is a model we used to respond to hurricanes—Hurricane Sandy, which I was deeply involved with. And in just a few moments, I'm going to sign a declaration to immediately begin reimbursing States 100 percent for the use of their national guards to help COVID relief efforts, something Democrats and Republican Governors alike have called for.
But the brutal truth is: It's going to take months before we can get the majority of Americans vaccinated. So while we increase vaccinations, we're going to take steps necessary now to slow the spread of the disease as well.
One of our 100-day challenges is asking the American people to mask up for the first 100 days—the next 99 days. The masks have become a partisan issue, unfortunately, but it's a patriotic act. But for a few months, to wear a mask—no vaccines—the fact is that they're the single best thing we can do. They're even more important than the vaccines—because they take time to work.
And if we do this as Americans, the experts say, by wearing a mask from now until April, we'd save more than 50,000 lives going forward. Fifty thousand lives. So I'm asking every American to mask up for the next hundred days.
Yesterday I signed an executive action that requires masks and social distancing on Federal property. Today we'll be signing an additional executive action to extend masking requirements on interstate travel, like on trains, planes, and buses. And in light of the new COVID variants that we're—you're learning about, we are instituting now a new measure for individuals flying into the United States from other countries.
In addition to wearing masks, everyone flying to the United States from another country will need to test before they get on that plane, before they depart, and quarantine when they arrive in America.
Our national plan launches a full-scale wartime effort to address the supply shortages by ramping up production and protective equipment—syringes, needles—you name it. And when I say ""wartime,"" people kind of look at me, like, ""Wartime?"" Well, as I said last night, 400,000 Americans have died. That's more than have died in all of World War II. Four hundred thousand. And this is a wartime undertaking.
Today I'm signing an executive action to use the Defense Production Act and all other available authorities to direct all Federal agencies and private industry to accelerate the making of everything that's needed to protect, test, vaccinate, and take care of our people. We're—we've already identified suppliers, and we're working with them on—to move a plan forward.
Now, look, our strategy includes a plan to safely reopen schools and businesses, while protecting our workers. Today we're directing the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services to immediately provide schools and communities with clear guidance and resources to safely reopen the schools and childcare centers.
We're putting—and by the way, when you do that, think of all of the people who can get back to work, who will be able to get back to work—all the mothers and single fathers that are staying home, taking care of their children.
We're going to put the full force of the Federal Government behind expanding testing by launching a COVID-19 Pandemic Testing Board. This effort will ensure that we get testing to where it is needed and where it's needed most, helping schools and businesses reopen safely, and protecting the most vulnerable, like those who live in long-term care facilities.
And for the millions of workers—many of whom are people of color, immigrants, and low-wage workers—who continue to put their lives on the line to keep this country going through the pandemic, I am calling for the enforcement of more stringent worker safety standards so that you are better protected from this virus while you have to continue to work to protect the rest of us.
Our plan also protects those most at risk and works for everyone of all races and in urban and rural communities alike.
Today I'm formalizing the Health Equity Task Force that we announced in the transition, led by the brilliant Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, who ensures that—is going to ensure that equality is at the core of every decision we make. That includes addressing vaccine hesitancy and building trust in communities, as well as fighting disinformation campaigns that are already underway.
Above all, our plan is to restore public trust. We will make sure that science and public experts—scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you. That's why you're going to be hearing a lot more from Dr. Fauci again—and not from the President, but from the real genuine experts and scientists.
We're going to make sure they work free from political interference, and that they make decisions strictly based on science and health care alone—science and health alone, not what the political consequences are.
Vice President Harris and I and our entire administration will always be honest and transparent with you about both the good news and the bad. We will level with you when we make a mistake. We'll straight up say what happened. And I said at the outset: The honest truth is we're still in a dark winter of this pandemic. It's going to get worse before it gets better. It's going to take many months to get where we need to be.
Progress from our plan will take time to measure, as people getting infected today—they don't show up in case counts for weeks, and those who perish from the disease die weeks after their exposure. Despite the best intentions, we're going to face setbacks, which I will always explain to you.
But I also know: We can do this if we come together. That's why, ultimately, our plan is based on unity and all of us acting as one Nation. It requires families and neighbors looking out for one another; health care providers, and businesses, and civic and religious and civil rights organizations, and unions all relying together on a common purpose, with urgency and purpose and resolve.
It requires reasserting our global leadership, which is why I took an action yesterday for the United States to rejoin the World Health Organization and to reestablish our Global Pandemic Office in the National Security Council.
It requires Congress coming together to provide the necessary funding in the COVID-relief package and the American Rescue Plan that I will soon be sending to the Congress. I know these bold, practical steps will not come cheaply, but failing to do so will cost us so much more dearly. I look forward to working with Members of both parties in the Congress. We're in a national emergency, and it's time we treat it like one—together, with a national plan, as the United States of America.
As I said yesterday in my Inaugural Address, there are moments in history when more is asked of a particular generation, more is asked of us as Americans than other times. We are in that moment now. History is going to measure whether we were up to the task. I believe we are. The American people have given so much already, but I believe they're ready to set big goals and pursue them with courage, conviction, and honesty because the health of the Nation is literally at stake. It's not hyperbole.
I'm convinced the American people are ready, as well, to spare no effort, no expense to get this done. What could be more important? The more people we vaccinate and the faster we do it, the sooner we can put this pandemic behind us and the sooner we can build our economy back and build it back better and get back to our lives and to our loved ones.
We can do this. We can do this if we stand together as fellow Americans, as the—and as the United States of America.
So God bless those lost souls in this pandemic and their families, all they've left behind. May God bless all of you on the frontlines who define the best of who we are as Americans.
Thank you very much. Now I'm going to go over to this desk and sign these executive actions. But again, this is the plan. This is the plan. You can go online and get it. I know it's a lot of heavy reading, but it's all laid out in stark detail here.
Thank you.

Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, you set the goal at 100 million vaccines in your first hundred days. Is that high enough? Shouldn't you set the bar higher? That's basically where the U.S. is right now.
The President. When I announced it, you all said, ""It's not possible."" Come on, give me a break, man, will you? But it's a good start. One hundred million.

20-Jan-21,Inaugural Address,"Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, and my distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans: This is America's day. This is democracy's day, a day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve. Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew, and America has risen to the challenge.
Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The people—the will of the people has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded. We've learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.
So now, on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol's very foundation, we come together as one Nation under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. As we look ahead in our uniquely American way—restless, bold, optimistic—and set our sights on the Nation we know we can be and we must be, I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. And I know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength, the strength of our Nation, as does President Carter, who I spoke with last night, who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service.
I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots have taken, the oath first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us, on ""We the People,"" who seek a more perfect Union.
This is a great Nation; we are good people. Over the centuries, through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we've come so far. But we still have far to go. We'll press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities: much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build, and much to gain.
Few people in our Nation's history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now. A once-in-a-century virus that silently stalks the country has taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost; hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from the planet itself, a cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear. And now, a rise of political extremism, White supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.
To overcome these challenges—to restore the soul and secure the future of America—requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: unity. Unity.
In another January on New Year's Day in 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper, the President said, and I quote, ""If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act, and my whole soul is in it."" My whole soul is in it.
Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our Nation. And I ask every American to join me in this cause: uniting to fight the foes we face: anger, resentment, and hatred; extremism, lawlessness, violence; disease, joblessness, and hopelessness.
With unity we can do great things, important things. We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome the deadly virus. We can reward work and rebuild the middle class and make health care secure for all. We can deliver racial justice, and we can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the world.
I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial. And victory is never assured.
Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our ""better angels"" have always prevailed. In each of these moments, enough of us—enough of us—have come together to carry all of us forward. And we can do that now. History, faith, and reason show the way: the way of unity.
We can see each other not as adversaries, but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos.
This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail. We have never, ever, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together.
And so today, at this time, in this place, let's start afresh, all of us. Let's begin to listen to one another, hear one another, see one another, show respect to one another. Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war. And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.
My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. America has to be better than this. And I believe America is so much better than this.
Just look around. Here we stand, in the shadow of the Capitol dome, as was mentioned earlier, completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself was literally hanging in the balance. Yet we endured, we prevailed.
Here we stand looking out on the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream.
Here we stand, where 108 years ago, at another Inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. And today we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office: Vice President Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things can't change.
Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace.
And here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever—not ever.
To all those who supported our campaign, I am humbled by the faith you've placed in us. To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. And if you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps this Nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion. And I pledge this to you: I will be a President for all Americans—all Americans. And I promise you, I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did.
Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love—defined by the common objects of their love. What are the common objects we as Americans love? That define us as Americans? I think we know: opportunity, security, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, and yes, the truth.
Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth, and there are lies: lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and a responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders—leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our Nation—to defend the truth and defeat the lies.
Look, I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs. I understand, like my dad, they lay at bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering: ""Can I keep my health care? Can I pay my mortgage?"" Thinking about their families, about what comes next. I promise you, I get it. But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don't look like you or worship the way you do or don't get their news from the same sources you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes, as my mom would say, just for a moment. Stand in their shoes.
Because here is the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days when you need a hand. There are other days when we're called to lend a hand. That's how it has to be. That is what we do for one another. And if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. And we can still disagree.
My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we're going to need each other. We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. We're entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one Nation. One Nation. And I promise you this: As the Bible says, ""Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning."" We will get through this, together—together.
Look, folks, all my colleagues that I served with in the House and the Senate up here. We all understand the world is watching, watching all of us today. So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested, and we have come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again, not to meet yesterday's challenges, but today's and tomorrow's challenges. And we'll lead not merely by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. We will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security.
Look, you all know, we have been through so much in this Nation. And, in my first act as President, I'd like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic, those 400,000 fellow Americans: moms, dads, husbands, wives, sons, daughters, friends, neighbors, and coworkers. We will honor them by becoming the people and Nation we know we can and should be.
So I ask you, let's say a silent prayer for those who have lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our country.
[At this point, a moment of silence was observed.]
Amen.
Folks, this is a time of testing. We face an attack on our democracy and on truth, a raging virus, growing inequity, the sting of systemic racism, a climate in crisis, America's role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is, we face them all at once, presenting this Nation with one of the gravest of responsibilities we've had.
Now we're going to be tested. Are we going to step up? All of us? It is time for boldness, for there is so much to do. And this is certain, I promise you: We will be judged, you and I, by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era. Will we rise to the occasion, is the question. Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world to our children? I believe we must; I'm sure you do as well. I believe we will.
And when we do, we will write the next great chapter in the history of the United States of America: the American story, a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. It's called ""American Anthem,"" and there's one verse that stands out, at least for me, and it goes like this:
""The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this dayWhat shall be our legacy? What will our children say? . . .Let me know in my heart when my days are throughAmerica, America, I gave my best to you.""
Let's add—let's us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great Nation. If we do this, then when our days are through, our children and our children's children will say of us: ""They gave their best. They did their duty. They healed a broken land.""
My fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with a sacred oath. Before God and all of you I give you my word: I will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution. I will defend our democracy. I will defend America. And I will give all, all of you, keep everything you—I do, in your service, thinking not of power, but of possibilities; not of personal interest, but of the public good. And together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear; of unity, not division; of light, not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healing, greatness and goodness.
May this be the story that guides us, the story that inspires us, and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history, we met the moment; democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch, but thrived; that America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. That is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow.
So with purpose and resolve we turn to those tasks of our time, sustained by faith, driven by conviction, and devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts.
May God bless America, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, America.","NOTE: The President spoke at 11:52 a.m. at the West Front of the U.S. Capitol.
